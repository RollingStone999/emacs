A long series with long posts and a long time between posts. It turns out that when it comes to Musk and his shit, there was a lot to say.</p><p>Anyone who&#8217;s read the first three posts in this series is aware that I&#8217;ve not only been buried in the things Musk is doing, I&#8217;ve been drinking a tall glass of the Elon Musk Kool-Aid throughout. I&#8217;m very, very into it.</p><p>I kind of feel like that&#8217;s fine, right? The dude is a steel-bending industrial giant in America in a time when there aren&#8217;t supposed to be steel-bending industrial giants in America, igniting revolutions in huge, old industries that aren&#8217;t supposed to be revolutionable. After emerging from the 1990s dotcom party with $180 million, instead of sitting back in his investor chair listening to pitches from groveling young entrepreneurs, he decided to start a brawl with a <em>group </em>of 900-pound sumo wrestlers—the auto industry, the oil industry, the aerospace industry, the military-industrial complex, the energy utilities—and he might actually be <em>winning</em>. And all of this, it really seems, for the purpose of giving our species a better future.</p><p>Pretty Kool-Aid worthy. But someone being exceptionally rad isn&#8217;t Kool-Aid worthy enough to warrant 90,000 words over a string of months on a blog that&#8217;s supposed to be about a wide range of topics.</p><p>During the first post, I laid out the two objectives for the series:</p><p><strong>1) To understand why Musk is doing what he’s doing.</strong></p><p><strong>2) To understand why Musk is <em>able to </em>do what he’s doing. </strong></p><p>So far, we&#8217;ve spent most of the time exploring objective #1. But what <em>really</em> intrigued me as I began thinking about this was objective #2. I&#8217;m fascinated by those rare people in history who manage to dramatically change the world during their short time here, and I&#8217;ve always liked to study those people and read their biographies. Those people know something the rest of us don&#8217;t, and we can learn something valuable from them. Getting access to Elon Musk gave me what I decided was an unusual chance to get my hands on one of those people and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/examining-elon-musk-up-close.html\" target=\"_blank\">examine them up close</a>. If it were just Musk&#8217;s money or intelligence or ambition or good intentions that made him so capable, there would be more Elon Musks out there. No, it&#8217;s something else—what TED curator Chris Anderson called Musk&#8217;s &#8220;secret sauce&#8221;—and for me, this series became a mission to figure it out.</p><p>The good news is, after a <em>lot </em>of time thinking about this, reading about this, and talking to him and his staff, I think I&#8217;ve got it. What for a while was a large pile of facts, observations, and sound bites eventually began to congeal into a common theme—a trait in Musk that I believe he shares with many of the most dynamic icons in history and that separates him from almost everybody else.</p><p>As I worked through the Tesla and SpaceX posts, this concept kept surfacing, and it became clear to me that this series couldn&#8217;t end without a deep dive into exactly what it is that Musk and a few others do so unusually well. The thing that tantalized me is that this secret sauce is actually accessible to everyone and right there in front of us—if we can just wrap our heads around it. Mulling this all over has legitimately affected the way I think about my life, my future, and the choices I make—and I&#8217;m going to try my best in this post to explain why.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Two Kinds of Geology</strong></span></p><p>In 1681, English theologian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Burnet\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Burnet</a> published <i>Sacred Theory of the Earth, </i>in which he explained how geology worked. What happened was, around 6,000 years ago, the Earth was formed as a perfect sphere with a surface of idyllic land and a watery interior. But then, when the surface dried up a little later, cracks formed in its surface, releasing much of the water from within. The result was the Biblical Deluge and Noah having to deal with a ton of shit all week. Once things settled down, the Earth was no longer a perfect sphere—all the commotion had distorted the surface, bringing about mountains and valleys and caves down below, and the whole thing was littered with the fossils of the flood&#8217;s victims.</p><p>And bingo. Burnet had figured it out. The great puzzle of fundamental theology had been to reconcile the large number of seemingly-very-old Earth features with the much shorter timeline of the Earth detailed in the Bible. For theologians of the time, it was their version of the general relativity vs. quantum mechanics quandary, and Burnet had come up with a viable string theory to unify it all under one roof.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t just Burnet. There were enough theories kicking around reconciling geology with the verses of the Bible to today warrant a 15,000-word &#8220;Flood Geology&#8221; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_geology\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p><p>Around the same time, another group of thinkers started working on the geology puzzle: scientists.</p><p>For the theologian puzzlers, the starting rules of the game were, &#8220;Fact: the Earth began 6,000 years ago and there was at one point an Earth-sweeping flood,&#8221; and their puzzling took place strictly within that context. But the scientists started the game with no rules at all. The puzzle was a blank slate where any observations and measurements they found were welcome.</p><p>Over the next 300 years, the scientists built theory upon theory, and as new technologies brought in new types of measurements, old theories were debunked and replaced with new updated versions. The science community kept surprising themselves as the apparent age of the Earth grew longer and longer. In 1907, there was a huge breakthrough when American scientist Bertram Boltwood pioneered the technique of deciphering the age of rocks through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating\" target=\"_blank\">radiometric dating</a>, which found elements in a rock with a known rate of radioactive decay and measured what portion of those elements remained intact and what portion had already converted to decay substance.</p><p>Radiometric dating blew Earth&#8217;s history backwards into the billions of years, which burst open new breakthroughs in science like the theory of Continental Drift, which in turn led to the theory of Plate Tectonics. The scientists were on a roll.</p><p>Meanwhile, the flood geologists would have none of it. To them, any conclusions from the science community were moot because they were breaking the rules of the game to begin with. The Earth was <em>officially</em> less than 6,000 years old, so if radiometric dating showed otherwise, it was a flawed technique, period.</p><p>But the scientific evidence grew increasingly compelling, and as time wore on, more and more flood geologists threw in the towel and accepted the scientist&#8217;s viewpoint—maybe they had had the rules of the game wrong.</p><p>Some, though, held strong. The rules were the rules, and it didn&#8217;t matter how many people agreed that the Earth was billions of years old—it was a grand conspiracy.</p><p>Today, there are <a href=\"https://www.probe.org/the-grand-canyon-and-the-age-of-the-earth/\" target=\"_blank\">still</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/usnews/060907a.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> flood geologists making their case. Just recently, an author named Tom Vail wrote a book called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Canyon-A-Different-View/dp/0890513732\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Canyon: A Different View</a></em>, in which he explains:</p><p><em>Contrary to what is widely believed, radioactive dating has not proven the rocks of the Grand Canyon to be millions of years old. The vast majority of the sedimentary layers in the Grand Canyon were deposited as the result of a global flood that occurred after and as a result of the initial sin that took place in the Garden of Eden.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>If the website analytics stats on <a href=\"https://chartbeat.com\" target=\"_blank\">Chartbeat</a> included a &#8220;Type of Geologist&#8221; demographic metric, I imagine that for Wait But Why readers, the breakdown would look something like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geology-Breakdown.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4415 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geology-Breakdown.jpg\" alt=\"Geology Breakdown\" width=\"401\" height=\"277\" /></a></p><p>It makes sense. Whether religious or not, most people who read this site are big on data, evidence, and accuracy. I&#8217;m reminded of this every time I make an error in a post.</p><p>Whatever role faith plays in the spiritual realm, what most of us agree on is that when seeking answers to our questions about the age of the Earth, the history of our species, the causes of lightning, or any other physical phenomenon in the universe, data and logic are far more effective tools than faith and scripture.</p><p>And yet—after thinking about this for a while, I&#8217;ve come to an unpleasant conclusion:</p><p><strong>When it comes to most of the way we think, the way we make decisions, and the way we live our lives, we&#8217;re much more like the flood geologists than the science geologists.</strong></p><p>And Elon&#8217;s secret? He&#8217;s a scientist through and through.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Hardware and Software</strong></span></p><p>The first clue to the way Musk thinks is in the super odd way that he talks. For example:</p><p><strong>Human child: </strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared of the dark, because that&#8217;s when all the scary shit is gonna get me and I won&#8217;t be able to see it coming.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>&#8220;When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it&#8217;s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn&#8217;t afraid of the dark anymore after that.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-2-4367\" id=\"note2-2-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>Or:</p><p><strong>Human father: </strong>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to start working less because my kids are starting to grow up.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>“I’m trying to throttle back, because particularly the triplets are starting to gain consciousness. They’re almost two.”<a href=\"#footnote2-3-4367\" id=\"note2-3-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p>Or:</p><p><strong>Human single man: </strong>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to find a girlfriend. I don&#8217;t want to be so busy with work that I have no time for dating.&#8221;</p><p><b>Elon: </b>&#8220;I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to 10 — how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-4367\" id=\"note2-4-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p>I call this MuskSpeak. MuskSpeak is a language that describes everyday parts of life as exactly what they actually, literally are.</p><p>There are plenty of instances of technical situations when we all agree that MuskSpeak makes much more sense than normal human parlance—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heart-Surgery1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4441 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heart-Surgery1.jpg\" alt=\"Heart Surgery\" width=\"533\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><p>—but what makes Musk odd is that he thinks about <em>most </em>things in MuskSpeak, including many areas where you don&#8217;t usually find it. Like when I asked him if he was afraid of death, and he said having kids made him more comfortable with dying, because &#8220;kids sort of are a bit you. At least they’re half you. They’re half you at the hardware level, and depending on how much time you have with them, they’re that percentage of you at the software level.&#8221;</p><p>When you or I look at kids, we see small, dumb, cute people. When Musk looks at his five kids, he sees five of his favorite computers. When he looks at you, he sees a computer. And when he looks in the mirror, he sees a computer—<em>his </em>computer. It&#8217;s not that Musk suggests that people are <em>just </em>computers—it&#8217;s that he sees people as computers on top of whatever else they are.</p><p>And at the most literal level, Elon&#8217;s right about people being computers. At its simplest definition, a computer is an object that can store and process data—which the brain certainly is.</p><p>And while this isn&#8217;t the most poetic way to think about our minds, I&#8217;m starting to believe that it&#8217;s one of those areas of life where MuskSpeak can serve us well—because thinking of a brain as a computer forces us to consider the distinction between our hardware and our software, a distinction we often fail to recognize.</p><p>For a computer, hardware is defined as &#8220;the machines, wiring, and other physical components of a computer.&#8221; So for a human, that&#8217;s the physical brain they were born with and all of its capabilities, which determines their raw intelligence, their innate talents, and other natural strengths and shortcomings.</p><p>A computer&#8217;s software is defined as &#8220;the programs and other operating information used by a computer.&#8221; For a human, that&#8217;s what they know and how they think—their belief systems, thought patterns, and reasoning methods. Life is a flood of incoming data of all kinds that enter the brain through our senses, and it&#8217;s the software that assesses and filters all that input, processes and organizes it, and ultimately uses it to generate the key output—a decision.</p><p>The hardware is a ball of clay that&#8217;s handed to us when we&#8217;re born. And of course, not all clay is equal—each brain begins as a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses across a wide range of processes and capabilities.</p><p>But it&#8217;s the software that determines what kind of tool the clay gets shaped into.</p><p>When people think about what makes someone like Elon Musk so effective, they often focus on the hardware—and Musk&#8217;s hardware has some pretty impressive specs. But the more I learn about Musk and other people who seem to have superhuman powers—whether it be Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, Genghis Khan, Marie Curie, John Lennon, Ayn Rand,<a href=\"#footnote-2-4367\" id=\"note-2-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> or Louis C.K.—the more I&#8217;m convinced that it&#8217;s their software, not their natural-born intelligence or talents, that makes them so rare and so effective.</p><p>So let&#8217;s talk about software—starting with Musk&#8217;s. As I wrote the other three posts in this series, I looked at everything I was learning about Musk—the things he says, the decisions he makes, the missions he takes on and how he approaches them—as clues to how his underlying software works.</p><p>Eventually, the clues piled up and the shape of the software began to reveal itself. Here&#8217;s what I think it looks like:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Elon&#8217;s Software</strong></span></p><p>The structure of Musk&#8217;s software starts like many of ours, with what we&#8217;ll call the Want box:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Box.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4402 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Box.png\" alt=\"Software - Want Box\" width=\"252\" height=\"267\" /></a></p><p>This box contains anything in life where you want Situation A to turn into Situation B. Situation A is currently what&#8217;s happening and you want something to change so that Situation B is what&#8217;s happening instead. Some examples:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wants.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4442 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wants.jpg\" alt=\"Wants\" width=\"600\" height=\"317\" /></a></p><p>Next, the Want box has a partner in crime—what we&#8217;ll call the Reality box. It contains all things that are possible:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Box.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4399 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Box.png\" alt=\"Software - Reality Box\" width=\"303\" height=\"246\" /></a></p><p>Pretty straightforward.</p><p>The overlap of the Want and Reality boxes is the Goal Pool, where your goal options live:<a href=\"#footnote-3-4367\" id=\"note-3-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Goal-Pool1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4434 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Goal-Pool1.png\" alt=\"Software - Goal Pool\" width=\"443\" height=\"212\" /></a></p><p>So you pick a goal from the pool—the thing you&#8217;re going to try to move from Point A to Point B.</p><p>And how do you cause something to change? You direct your power towards it. A person&#8217;s power can come in various forms: your time, your energy (mental and physical), your resources, your persuasive ability, your connection to others, etc.</p><p>The concept of employment is just Person A using their resources power (a paycheck) to direct Person B&#8217;s time and/or energy power toward Person A&#8217;s goal. When Oprah publicly recommends a book, that&#8217;s combining her abundant power of connection (she has a huge reach) and her abundant power of persuasion (people trust her) and directing them towards the goal of getting the book into the hands of thousands of people who would have otherwise never known about it.</p><p>Once a goal has been selected, you know the <em>direction</em> in which to point your power. Now it&#8217;s time to figure out the most effective way to use that power to generate the outcome you want—that&#8217;s your strategy:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Box.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4437 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Box.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Strategy Box\" width=\"421\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><p>Simple right? And probably not that different from how you think.</p><p>But what makes Musk&#8217;s software so effective isn&#8217;t its structure, it&#8217;s that he uses it like a scientist. Carl Sagan said, &#8220;Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge,&#8221; and you can see Musk apply that way of thinking in two key ways:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) He builds each software component himself, from the ground up. </strong></span></p><p>Musk calls this &#8220;reasoning from first principles.&#8221; I&#8217;ll let him explain:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I think generally people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good.” But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-5-4367\" id=\"note2-5-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p class=\"p1\">In science, this means starting with what evidence shows us to be true. A scientist doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Well we know the Earth is flat because that&#8217;s the way it looks, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s intuitive, and that&#8217;s what everyone agrees is true,&#8221; a scientist says, &#8220;The part of the Earth that I can see at any given time appears to be flat, which would be the case when looking at a small piece of many differently shaped objects up close, so I don&#8217;t have enough information to know what the shape of the Earth is. One reasonable hypothesis is that the Earth is flat, but until we have tools and techniques that can be used to prove or disprove that hypothesis, it is an open question.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">A scientist gathers together only what he or she knows to be true—the first principles—and uses those as the puzzle pieces with which to construct a conclusion.</p><p class=\"p1\">Reasoning from first principles is a hard thing to do in life, and Musk is a master at it. Brain software has four major decision-making centers:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>1) Filling in the Want box</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>2) Filling in the Reality box</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><b>3) Goal selection from the Goal Pool</b></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>4) Strategy formation</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Musk works through each of these boxes by reasoning from first principles. Filling in the Want box from first principles requires a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself. Filling in the Reality box requires the clearest possible picture of the actual facts of both the world and your own abilities. The Goal Pool should double as a Goal Selection Laboratory that contains tools for intelligently measuring and weighing options. And strategies should be formed based on what you know, not on what is typically done.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) He continually adjusts each component&#8217;s conclusions as new information comes in.</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">You might remember doing proofs in geometry class, one of the most mundane parts of everyone&#8217;s childhood. These ones:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given:</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given:</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore:</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">Math is satisfyingly exact. Its givens are exact and its conclusions are airtight.</p><p class=\"p1\">In math, we call givens &#8220;axioms,&#8221; and axioms are 100% true. So when we build conclusions out of axioms, we call them &#8220;proofs,&#8221; which are also 100% true.</p><p class=\"p1\">Science doesn&#8217;t have axioms or proofs, for good reason.</p><p class=\"p1\">We could have called Newton&#8217;s law of universal gravitation a proof—and for a long time, it certainly seemed like one—but then what happens when Einstein comes around and shows that Newton was actually &#8220;zoomed in,&#8221; like someone calling the Earth flat, and when you zoom <em>way </em>out, you discover that the <em>real </em>law is general relativity and Newton&#8217;s law actually stops working under extreme conditions, while general relativity works no matter what. So then, you&#8217;d call general relativity a proof instead. Except then what happens when quantum mechanics comes around and shows that general relativity fails to apply on a tiny scale and that a new set of laws is needed to account for those cases.</p><p class=\"p1\">There are no axioms or proofs in science because nothing is for sure and everything we feel sure about might be disproven. Richard Feynman has said, &#8220;Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty—some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.&#8221; Instead of proofs, science has <em>theories</em>. Theories are based on hard evidence and treated as truths, but at all times they&#8217;re susceptible to being adjusted or disproven as new data emerges.</p><p class=\"p1\">So in science, it&#8217;s more like:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (for now):</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given (for now):</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore (for now):</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">In our lives, the only true axiom is &#8220;I exist.&#8221; Beyond that, nothing is for sure. And for most things in life, we can&#8217;t even build a real scientific theory because life doesn&#8217;t tend to have exact measurements.</p><p class=\"p1\">Usually, the best we can do is a strong hunch based on what data we have. And in science, a hunch is called a hypothesis. Which works like this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (it seems, based on what I know):</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given (<strong>it seems, based on what I know</strong>):</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore (<strong>it seems, based on what I know</strong>):</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">Hypotheses are built to be tested. Testing a hypothesis can disprove it or strengthen it, and if it passes enough tests, it can be upgraded to a theory.</p><p class=\"p1\">So after Musk builds his conclusions from first principles, what does he do? He tests the shit out of them, continually, and adjusts them regularly based on what he learns. Let&#8217;s go through the whole process to show how:</p><p class=\"p1\">You begin by reasoning from first principles to A) fill in the Want box, B) fill in the Reality box, C) select a goal from the pool, and D) build a strategy—and then you get to work. You&#8217;ve used first principles thinking to decide where to point your power and the most effective way to use it.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the goal-achievement strategy you came up with was just your first crack. It was a hypothesis, ripe for testing. You test a strategy hypothesis one way: action. You pour your power into the strategy and see what happens. As you do this, data starts flowing in—results, feedback, and new information from the outside world. Certain parts of your strategy hypothesis might be strengthened by this new data, others might be weakened, and new ideas may have sprung to life in your head through the experience—but either way, some adjustment is usually called for:<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Loop.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4401 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Loop.png\" alt=\"Software - Strategy Loop\" width=\"345\" height=\"469\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">As this strategy loop spins and your power becomes more and more effective at accomplishing your goal, other things are happening down below.</p><p class=\"p1\">For someone reasoning from first principles, the Want box at any given time is a snapshot of their innermost desires the last time they thought hard about it. But the contents of the Want box are also a hypothesis, and experience can show you that you were wrong about something you thought you wanted or that you want something you didn&#8217;t realize you did. At the same time, the inner you isn&#8217;t a statue—it&#8217;s a shifting, morphing sculpture whose innermost values change as time passes. So even if something in the Want box was correct at one point, as <em>you</em> change, it may lose its place in the box. The Want box should serve the current inner you as best possible, which requires you to update it, something you do through reflection:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4438 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Want Loop\" width=\"453\" height=\"505\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">A rotating Want loop is called evolution.</p><p class=\"p1\">On the other side of the aisle, the Reality box is also going through a process. &#8220;Things that are possible&#8221; is a hypothesis, maybe more so than anything else. It takes into account both the state of the world and your own abilities. And as your own abilities change and grow, the world changes even faster. What was possible in the world in 2005 is <em>very</em> different from what&#8217;s possible today, and it&#8217;s a huge (and rare) advantage to be working with an up-to-date Reality box.</p><p class=\"p1\">Filling in your Reality box from first principles is a great challenge, and keeping the box current so that it matches actual reality takes continual work.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Loop.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4428 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Loop.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Reality Loop\" width=\"482\" height=\"482\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">For each of these areas, the box represents the current hypothesis and the circle represents the source of new information that can be used to adjust the hypothesis. It&#8217;s our duty to remember that the circles are the boss, not the boxes—the boxes are only trying their best to do the circles proud. And if we fall out of touch with what&#8217;s happening in the circles, the info in the boxes becomes obsolete and a less effective source for our decision-making.</p><p class=\"p1\">Thinking about the software as a whole, let&#8217;s take a step back. What we see is a goal formation mechanism below and a goal attainment mechanism above. One thing goal attainment often requires is laser focus. To get the results we want, we zoom in on the micro picture, sinking our teeth into our goal and honing in on it with our strategy loop.</p><p class=\"p1\">But as time passes, the Want box and Reality box adjust contents and morph shape, and eventually, something else can happen—the Goal Pool changes.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Goal Pool is just the overlap of the Want and Reality boxes, so its own shape and contents are totally dependent on the state of those boxes. And as you live your life inside the goal attainment mechanism above, it&#8217;s important to make sure that what you&#8217;re working so hard on remains in line with the Goal Pool below—so let&#8217;s add in two big red arrows for that:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Full.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4427 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Full.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Full\" width=\"567\" height=\"498\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Checking in with the large circle down below requires us to lift our heads up from the micro mission and do some macro reflection. And when enough changes happen in the Want and Reality boxes that the goal you&#8217;re pursuing is no longer in the goal pool, it calls for a macro life change—a breakup, a job switch, a relocation, a priority swap, an attitude shift.</p><p class=\"p1\">All together, the software I&#8217;ve described is a living, breathing system, constructed on a rock solid foundation of first principles, and built to be nimble, to keep itself honest, and to change shape as needed to best serve its owner.</p><p class=\"p1\">And if you read about Elon Musk&#8217;s life, you can watch this software in action.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How Musk&#8217;s software wrote his life story</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Getting started</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Step 1 for Elon was filling in the contents of the Want box. Doing this from first principles is a huge challenge—you have to dig deep into concepts like right and wrong, good and bad, important and trivial, valuable and frivolous. You have to figure out what you respect, what you disdain, what fascinates you, what bores you, and what excites you deep in your inner child. Of course, there&#8217;s no way for anyone of any age to have a clear cut answer to these questions, but Elon did the best thing he could by ignoring others and independently pondering.</p><p class=\"p1\">I talked with him about his early thought process in figuring out what to do with his career. He has said many times that he cares deeply about the future well-being of the human species—something that is clearly in the center of his Want box. I asked how he came to that, and he explained:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The thing that I care about is—when I look into the future, I see the future as a series of branching probability streams. So you have to ask, what are we doing to move down the good stream—the one that’s likely to make for a good future? Because otherwise, you look ahead, and it’s like “Oh it’s dark.” If you’re projecting to the future, and you’re saying “Wow, we’re gonna end up in some terrible situation,” that’s depressing.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Fair. Honing in on his specific path, I brought up the great modern physicists like Einstein and Hawking and Feynman, and I asked him whether he considered going into scientific discovery instead of engineering. His response:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I certainly admire the discoveries of the great scientists. They’re discovering what already exists—it’s a deeper understanding of how the universe already works. That’s cool—but the universe already sort of knows that. What matters is knowledge in a human context. What I’m trying to ensure is that knowledge in a human context is still possible in the future. So it’s sort of like—I’m more like the gardener, and then there are the flowers. If there’s no garden, there’s no flowers. I could try to be a flower in the garden, or I could try to make sure there is a garden. So I’m trying to make sure there is a garden, such that in the future, many Feynmans may bloom.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, both A and B are good, but without A there is no B. So I choose A.</p><p class=\"p1\">He went on:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I was at one point thinking about doing physics as a career—I did undergrad in physics—but in order to really advance physics these days, you need the data. Physics is fundamentally governed by the progress of engineering. This debate—“Which is better, engineers or scientists? Aren’t scientists better? Wasn’t Einstein the smartest person?”—personally, I think that engineering is better because in the absence of the engineering, you do not have the data. You just hit a limit. And yeah, you can be real smart within the context of the limit of the data you have, but unless you have a way to get more data, you can’t make progress. Like look at Galileo. He engineered the telescope—that’s what allowed him to see that Jupiter had moons. The limiting factor, if you will, is the engineering. And if you want to advance civilization, you must address the limiting factor. Therefore, you must address the engineering.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">A and B are both good, but B can only advance if A advances. So I choose A.</p><p class=\"p1\">In thinking about where exactly to point himself to best help humanity, Musk says that in college, he thought hard about the first principles question, “What will most affect the future of humanity?” and put together a list of five things: “the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.”<a href=\"#footnote2-6-4367\" id=\"note2-6-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><p class=\"p1\">Hearing him talk about what matters to him, you can see up and down the whole stack of Want box reasoning that led him to his current endeavors.</p><p class=\"p1\">He has other reasons too. Next to wanting to help humanity in the Want box is this quote:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I&#8217;m interested in things that change the world or affect future in wondrous new technology where you see it and you’re like, “How did that even happen? How is that possible?”</em><a href=\"#footnote2-7-4367\" id=\"note2-7-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p class=\"p1\">This follows a theme of Musk being passionate about super-advanced technology and the excitement it brings to him and other people. So given all of the above, an ideal endeavor for Musk would be something involving engineering, something in an area that will be important for the future, and something to do with cutting-edge technology. Those broad, basic Want box items alone narrow down the goal pool considerably.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, he was a teenager with no money, reputation, or connections, and limited knowledge and skills. In other words, his Reality box wasn&#8217;t that big. So he did what many young people do—he focused his early goals not around achieving his Wants, but expanding the Reality box and its list of &#8220;things that are possible.&#8221; He wanted to be able to legally stay in the US after college, and he also wanted to gain more knowledge about engineering, so he killed two birds with one stone and applied to a PhD program at Stanford to study high energy density capacitors, a technology aimed at coming up with a more efficient way than traditional batteries to store energy.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>U-turn to the internet</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Musk had gone into the Goal Pool and picked the Stanford program, and he moved to California to get started. But there was one thing—it was 1995. The internet was in the early stages of taking off and moving much faster than people had anticipated. It was also a world Musk could dive into without money or a reputation. So he added a bunch of internet-related possibilities into his Reality box. The early internet was also more <em>exciting </em>than he had anticipated—so getting involved in it quickly found its way into his Want box.</p><p class=\"p1\">These rapid adjustments caused big changes in his Goal Pool, to the point where the Stanford PhD was no longer what his software&#8217;s goal formation center was outputting.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most people would have stuck with the Stanford program—because they had already told everyone about it and it would be weird to quit, because it was Stanford, because it was a more normal path, because it was safer, because the internet might be a fad, because what if he were 35 one day and was a failure with no money because he couldn&#8217;t get a good job without the right degree.</p><p class=\"p1\">Musk quit the program after two days. The big macro arrow of his software came down on the right, saw that what he was embarking on wasn&#8217;t in the Goal Pool anymore, and he trusted his software—so he made a macro change.</p><p class=\"p1\">He started Zip2 with his brother, an early cross between the concepts of the Yellow Pages and Google Maps. Four years later, they sold the company and Elon walked away with $22 million.</p><p class=\"p1\">As a dotcom millionaire, the conventional wisdom was to settle down as a lifelong rich guy and either invest in other companies or start something new with other people&#8217;s money. But Musk&#8217;s goal formation center had other ideas. His Want box was bursting with ambitious startup ideas that he thought could have major impact on the world, and his Reality box, which now included $22 million, told him that he had a high chance of succeeding. Being leisurely on the sidelines was nowhere in his Want box and totally unnecessary according to his Reality box.</p><p class=\"p1\">So he used his newfound wealth to start X.com in 1999, with the vision to build a full-service online financial institution. The internet was still young and the concept of storing your money in an online bank was totally inconceivable to most people, and Musk was advised by many that it was a crazy plan. But again, Musk trusted his software. What he knew about the internet told him that this was inside the Reality box—because his reasoning told him that when it came to the internet, the Reality box had grown <em>much </em>bigger than people appreciated—and that was all he needed to know to move forward. In the top part of his software, as his strategy-action-results-adjustments loop spun, X.com&#8217;s service changed, the team changed, the mission changed, even the name changed. By the time eBay bought it in 2002, the company was called PayPal and it was a money transfer service. Musk made $180 million.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Following his software to space</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Now 31 years old and fabulously wealthy, Musk had to figure out what to do next with his life. On top of the &#8220;whatever you do, definitely don&#8217;t risk losing that money you have&#8221; conventional wisdom, there was also the common logic that said, &#8220;You&#8217;re awesome at building internet companies, but that&#8217;s all you know since you&#8217;ve never done anything else. You&#8217;re in your thirties now and it&#8217;s too late to do something big in a whole different field. This is the path you chose—you&#8217;re an internet guy.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">But Musk went back to first principles. He looked inwards to his Want box, and having reflected on things, doing another internet thing wasn&#8217;t really in the box anymore. What was in there was his still-burning desire to help the future of humanity. In particular, he felt that to have a long future, the species would have to become much better at space travel.</p><p class=\"p1\">So he started exploring the limits of the Reality box when it came to getting involved in the aerospace industry.</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom screamed at the top of its lungs for him to stop. It said he had no formal education in the field and didn&#8217;t know the first thing about being a rocket scientist. But his software told him that formal education was just another way to download information into your brain and &#8220;a painfully slow download&#8221; at that—so he started reading, meeting people, and asking questions.</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom said no entrepreneur had ever succeeded at an endeavor like this before, and that he shouldn&#8217;t risk his money on something so likely to fail. But Musk&#8217;s stated philosophy is, &#8220;When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom said that he couldn&#8217;t afford to build rockets because they were too expensive and pointed to the fact that no one had ever made a rocket that cheaply before—but like the scientists who ignored those who said the Earth was 6,000 years old and those who insisted the Earth was flat, Musk started crunching numbers to do the math himself. Here&#8217;s how he recounts his thoughts:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Historically, all rockets have been expensive, so therefore, in the future, all rockets will be expensive. But actually that&#8217;s not true. If you say, what is a rocket made of? It&#8217;s made of aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber. And you can break it down and say, what is the raw material cost of all these components? And if you have them stacked on the floor and could wave a magic wand so that the cost of rearranging the atoms was zero, then what would the cost of the rocket be? And I was like, wow, okay, it&#8217;s really small—it&#8217;s like 2% of what a rocket costs. So clearly it would be in how the atoms are arranged—so you&#8217;ve got to figure out how can we get the atoms in the right shape much more efficiently. And so I had a series of meetings on Saturdays with people, some of whom were still working at the big aerospace companies, just to try to figure out if there&#8217;s some catch here that I&#8217;m not appreciating. And I couldn&#8217;t figure it out. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any catch. So I started SpaceX.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-8-4367\" id=\"note2-8-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p class=\"p1\">History, conventional wisdom, and his friends all said one thing, but his own software, reasoning upwards from first principles, said another—and he trusted his software. He started <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a>, again with his own money, and dove in head first. The mission: dramatically lower the cost of space travel to make it possible for humanity to become multi-planetary.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Tesla and beyond</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Two years later, while running a growing SpaceX, a friend brought Elon to a company called AC Propulsion, which had created a prototype for a super-fast, long-range electric car. It blew him away. The Reality box of Musk&#8217;s software had told him that such a thing wasn&#8217;t yet possible, but it turns out that Musk wasn&#8217;t aware of how far lithium-ion batteries had advanced, and what he saw at AC Propulsion was new information about the world that put &#8220;starting a top-notch electric car company&#8221; into the Reality box in his head.</p><p class=\"p1\">He ran into the same conventional wisdom about battery costs as he had about rocket costs. Batteries had never been made cheaply enough to allow for a mass-market, long-range electric car because the cost of making a battery was simply too high. He used the same first principles logic and a calculator to determine that most of the problem was the cost of middlemen, not raw materials, and decided that actually, conventional wisdom was wrong and batteries could be much cheaper in the future. So he co-founded <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> with the mission of accelerating the advent of a mostly-electric-vehicle world—first by pouring in resources power and funding the company, and later by contributing his time and energy resources as well and becoming CEO.</p><p class=\"p1\">Two years after that, Musk co-founded <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html\" target=\"_blank\">SolarCity</a> with his cousins, a company whose goal was to revolutionize energy production by creating a large, distributed utility that would install solar panel systems on millions of homes. Musk knew that his time/energy power, the one kind of power that has hard limits, no matter who you are, was mostly used up, but he still had plenty of resources power—so he put it to work on another goal in his Goal Pool.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most recently, Musk has jumpstarted change in another area that&#8217;s important to him—the way people transport themselves from city to city. His idea is that there should be an entirely new mode of transport that will whiz people hundreds of miles by zinging them through a tube. He calls it the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop</a>. For this project, he&#8217;s not using his time, energy, or resources. Instead, by laying out his initial thoughts in a <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> and hosting a <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop\" target=\"_blank\">competition</a> for engineers to test out their innovations, he&#8217;s leveraging his powers of connection and persuasion to create change.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\">There are all kinds of tech companies that build software. They think hard, for years, about the best, most efficient way to make their product. Musk sees people as computers, and he sees his brain software as the most important product he owns—and since there aren&#8217;t companies out there designing brain software, he designed his own, beta tests it every day, and makes constant updates. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s so outrageously effective, why he can disrupt <em>multiple </em>huge industries at once, why he can learn so quickly, strategize so cleverly, and visualize the future so clearly.</p><p class=\"p1\">This part of what Musk does isn&#8217;t rocket science—it&#8217;s common sense. Your entire life runs on the software in your head—why <em>wouldn&#8217;t </em>you obsess over optimizing it?</p><p class=\"p1\">And yet, not only do most of us not obsess over our own software—most of us don&#8217;t even <em>understand</em> our own software, how it works, or why it works that way. Let&#8217;s try to figure out why.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Most People&#8217;s Software</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">You always hear facts about human development and how so much of who you become is determined by your experiences during your formative years. A newborn&#8217;s brain is a malleable ball of hardware clay, and its job upon being born is to quickly learn about whatever environment it&#8217;s been born into and start shaping itself into the optimal tool for survival in those circumstances. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so easy for young children to learn new skills.</p><p class=\"p1\">As people age, the clay begins to harden and it becomes more difficult to change the way the brain operates. My grandmother has been using a computer as long as I have, but I use mine comfortably and easily because my malleable childhood brain easily wrapped itself around basic computer skills, while she has the same face on when she uses her computer that my tortoise does when I put him on top of a glass table and he thinks he&#8217;s inexplicably hovering two feet above the ground. She&#8217;ll use a computer when she needs to, but it&#8217;s not her friend.</p><p class=\"p1\">So when it comes to our brain software—our values, perceptions, belief systems, reasoning techniques—what are we learning during those key early years?</p><p class=\"p1\">Everyone&#8217;s raised differently, but for most people I know, it went something like this:</p><p class=\"p1\">We were taught all kinds of things by our parents and teachers—what&#8217;s right and wrong, what&#8217;s safe and dangerous, the kind of person you should and shouldn&#8217;t be. But the idea was: I&#8217;m an adult so I know much more about this than you, it&#8217;s not up for debate, don&#8217;t argue, just obey. That&#8217;s when the cliché &#8220;Why?&#8221; game comes in (what ElonSpeak calls &#8220;the chained why&#8221;).</p><p class=\"p1\">A child&#8217;s instinct isn&#8217;t just to know what to do and not to do, she wants to <em>understand </em>the rules of her environment. And to understand something, you have to have a sense of how that thing was built. When parents and teachers tell a kid to do XYZ and to simply obey, it&#8217;s like installing a piece of already-designed software in the kid&#8217;s head. When kids ask Why? and then Why? and then Why?, they&#8217;re trying to deconstruct that software to see how it was built—to get down to the first principles underneath so they can weigh how much they should actually care about what the adults seem so insistent upon.</p><p class=\"p1\">The first few times a kid plays the Why game, parents think it&#8217;s cute. But many parents, and most teachers, soon come up with a way to cut the game off:</p><p class=\"p1\">Because I said so.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Because I said so&#8221; inserts a concrete floor into the child&#8217;s deconstruction effort below which no further Why&#8217;s may pass. It says, &#8220;You want first principles? There. There&#8217;s your floor. No more Why&#8217;s necessary.

They have to do all the shit they used to have to do, except now on top of that there are these self-obsessed, drippy little creatures they have to upkeep, who think parents exist to serve them. On a busy day, in a bad mood, with 80 things to do, the Why game is a nightmare.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it might be a nightmare worth enduring. A command or a lesson or a word of wisdom that comes without any insight into the steps of logic it was built upon is feeding a kid a fish instead of teaching them to reason. And when that&#8217;s the way we&#8217;re brought up, we end up with a bucket of fish and no rod—a piece of installed software that we&#8217;ve learned how to use, but no ability to code anything ourselves.</p><p class=\"p1\">School makes things worse. One of my favorite thinkers, writer Seth Godin (whose <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> is bursting with first principles reasoning wisdom), explains in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXpbONjV1Jc\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a> about school that the current education system is a product of the Industrial Age, a time that catapulted productivity and the standard of living. But along with many more factories came the need for many more factory workers, so our education system was redesigned around that goal. He explains:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The deal was: universal public education whose sole intent was not to train the scholars of tomorrow—we had plenty of scholars. It was to train people to be willing to work in the factory. It was to train people to behave, to comply, to fit in. &#8220;We process you for a whole year. If you are defective, we hold you back and process you again. We sit you in straight rows, just like they organize things in the factory. We build a system all about interchangeable people because factories are based on interchangeable parts.&#8221;</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Couple that concept with what another favorite writer of mine, James Clear, explained recently on his <a href=\"http://jamesclear.com/creative-thinking\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>In the 1960s, a creative performance researcher named George Land conducted a study of 1,600 five-year-olds and 98 percent of the children scored in the “highly creative” range. Dr. Land re-tested each subject during five year increments. When the same children were 10-years-old, only 30 percent scored in the highly creative range. This number dropped to 12 percent by age 15 and just 2 percent by age 25. As the children grew into adults they effectively had the creativity trained out of them. In the words of Dr. Land, “non-creative behavior is learned.&#8221;</em></p><p class=\"p1\">It makes sense, right? Creative thinking is a close cousin of first principles reasoning. In both cases, the thinker needs to <em>invent</em> his own thought pathways. People think of creativity as a natural born talent, but it&#8217;s actually much more of a <em>way of thinking</em>—it&#8217;s the thinking version of painting onto a blank canvas. But to do that requires brain software that&#8217;s skilled and practiced at coming up with new things, and school trains us on the exact opposite concept—to follow the leader, single-file, and to get really good at taking tests. Instead of a blank canvas, school hands kids a coloring book and tells them to stay within the lines.<a href=\"#footnote-4-4367\" id=\"note-4-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p class=\"p1\">What this all amounts to is that during our brain&#8217;s most malleable years, parents, teachers, and society end up putting our clay in a mold and squeezing it tightly into a preset shape.</p><p class=\"p1\">And when we grow up, without having learned how to build our own style of reasoning and having gone through the early soul-searching that independent thinking requires, we end up needing to rely on whatever software was installed in us for everything—software that, coming from parents and teachers, was probably itself designed 30 years ago.</p><p class=\"p1\">30 years, if we&#8217;re lucky. Let&#8217;s think about this for a second.</p><p class=\"p1\">Just say you have an overbearing mother who insists you grow up with her values, her worldview, her fears, and her ambitions—because she knows best, because it&#8217;s a scary world out there, because XYZ is respectable, because she said so.</p><p class=\"p1\">Your head might end up running your whole life on &#8220;because mom says so&#8221; software. If you play the Why? game with something like the reason you&#8217;re in your current job, it may take a few Why&#8217;s to get there, but you&#8217;ll most likely end up hitting a concrete floor that says some version of &#8220;because mom says so.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">But why does mom say so?</p><p class=\"p1\">Mom says so because <em>her</em> mom said so—after growing up in Poland in 1932, where she was from a home where <em>her</em> dad said so because <em>his </em>dad—a minister from a small town outside Krakow—said so after his grandfather, who saw some terrible shit go down during the Siberian Uprising of 1866, ingrained in his children&#8217;s heads the critical life lesson to never associate with blacksmiths.</p><p class=\"p1\">Through a long game of telephone, your mother now looks down upon office jobs and you find yourself feeling strongly about the only truly respectable career being in publishing. And you can list off a bunch of reasons why you feel that way—but if someone <em>really </em>grilled you on your reasons and on the reasoning beneath them, you end up in a confusing place. It gets confusing way down there because the first principles foundation at the bottom is a mishmash of the values and beliefs of a bunch of people from different generations and countries—a bunch of people who aren&#8217;t you.</p><p class=\"p1\">A common example of this in today&#8217;s world is that many people I know were raised by people who were raised by people who went through the Great Depression. If you solicit career advice from someone born in the US in the 1920s, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll get an answer pumped out by this software:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grandma-Software.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4460 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grandma-Software.jpg\" alt=\"Grandma Software\" width=\"359\" height=\"584\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The person has lived a long life and has made it all the way to 2015, but their software was coded during the Great Depression, and if they&#8217;re not the type to regularly self-reflect and evolve, they still do their thinking with software from 1930. And if they installed that same software in their children&#8217;s heads and their children then passed it on to their own children, a member of Generation Y today might feel too scared to pursue an entrepreneurial or artistic endeavor and be totally unaware that they&#8217;re actually being haunted by the ghost of the Great Depression.</p><p class=\"p1\">When old software is installed on new computers, people end up with a set of values not necessarily based on their own deep thinking, a set of beliefs about the world not necessarily based on the reality of the world they live in, and a bunch of opinions they might have a hard time defending with an honest heart.</p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, a whole lot of convictions not really based on actual data. We have a word for that.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dogma</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with people: they don&#8217;t learn by understanding, they learn by some other way—by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!</em> —Richard Feynman</p><p class=\"p1\">Dogma is everywhere and comes in a thousand different varieties—but the format is generally the same:</p><p class=\"p1\">X is true because [authority] says so. The authority can be many things.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Because-I-said-so-21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4519\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Because-I-said-so-21.jpg\" alt=\"Because I said so 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"1867\" /></a></p><p>Dogma, unlike first principles reasoning, isn&#8217;t customized to the believer or her environment and isn&#8217;t meant to be critiqued and adjusted as things change. It&#8217;s not software to be coded—it&#8217;s a printed rulebook. Its rules may be originally based on reasoning by a certain kind of thinker in a certain set of circumstances, at a time far in the past or a place far away, or it may be based on no reasoning at all. But that doesn&#8217;t matter because you&#8217;re not supposed to dig too deep under the surface anyway—you&#8217;re just supposed to accept it, embrace it, and live by it. No evidence needed.</p><p class=\"p1\">You may not like living by someone else&#8217;s dogma, but you&#8217;re left without much choice. When your childhood attempts at understanding are met with &#8220;Because I said so,&#8221; and you absorb the implicit message &#8220;Your own reasoning capability is shit, don&#8217;t even try, just follow these rules so you don&#8217;t fuck your life up,&#8221; you grow up with little confidence in your own reasoning process. When you&#8217;re never forced to build your own reasoning pathways, you&#8217;re able to skip the hard process of digging deep to discover your own values and the sometimes painful experience of testing those values in the real world and learning you want to adjust them—and so you grow up a total reasoning amateur.</p><p class=\"p1\">Only strong reasoning skills can carve a unique life path, and without them, dogma will quickly have you living someone else&#8217;s life. Dogma doesn&#8217;t know you or care about you and is often completely wrong for you—it&#8217;ll have a would-be happy painter spending their life as a lawyer and a would-be happy lawyer spending their life as a painter.</p><p class=\"p1\">But when you don&#8217;t know how to reason, you don&#8217;t know how to evolve or adapt. If the dogma you grew up with isn&#8217;t working for you, you can reject it, but as a reasoning amateur, going it alone usually ends with you finding another dogma lifeboat to jump onto—another rulebook to follow and another authority to obey. You don&#8217;t know how to code your own software, so you install someone else&#8217;s.</p><p class=\"p1\">People don&#8217;t do any of this intentionally—usually if we reject a type of dogma, our intention is to break free of a life of dogmatic thinking altogether and brave the cold winds of independent reasoning. But dogmatic thinking is a hard habit to break, especially when it&#8217;s all you know. I have a friend who just had a baby, and she told me that she was so much more open-minded than her parents, because they wanted her to have a prestigious career, but she&#8217;d be open to her daughter doing anything. After a minute, she thought about it, and said, &#8220;Well actually, no, what I mean by that is if she wanted to go do something like spend her life on a farm in Montana, I&#8217;d be fine with that and my parents never would have been—but if she said she wanted to go work at a hedge fund, I&#8217;d kill her.&#8221; She realized mid-sentence that she wasn&#8217;t free of the rigid dogmatic thinking of her parents, she had just changed dogma brands.</p><p>This is the dogma trap, and it&#8217;s hard to escape from. Especially since dogma has a powerful ally—the group.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong> Tribes</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I’m very suspicious. It doesn’t make sense to me that you’d have the same solution to every issue.</em> —Louis C.K.</p><p class=\"p1\">What most dogmatic thinking tends to boil down to is another good Seth Godin <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/07/people-like-us-do-stuff-like-this.html\" target=\"_blank\">phrase</a>:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>People like us do stuff like this.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s the rallying cry of tribalism.</p><p class=\"p1\">There&#8217;s an important distinction to make here. Tribalism tends to have a negative connotation, but the concept of a tribe itself isn&#8217;t bad. A tribe is just a group of people linked together by something they have in common—a religion, an ethnicity, a nationality, family, a philosophy, a cause. Christianity is a tribe. The US Democratic Party is a tribe. Australians are a tribe. Radiohead fans are a tribe. Arsenal fans are a tribe. The musical theater scene in New York is a tribe. Temple University is a tribe. And within large, loose tribes, there are smaller, tighter, sub-tribes. Your extended family is a tribe, of which your immediate family is a sub-tribe. Americans are a tribe, of which Texans are a sub-tribe, of which Evangelical Christians in Amarillo, Texas is a sub-sub-tribe.</p><p class=\"p1\">What makes tribalism a good or bad thing depends on the tribe member and their relationship with the tribe. In particular, one simple distinction:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tribalism is good when the tribe and the tribe member both have an independent identity and they <em>happen </em>to be the same. </strong>The tribe member has chosen to be a part of the tribe because it happens to match who he really is. If either the identity of the tribe or the member evolves to the point where the two no longer match, the person will leave the tribe. Let&#8217;s call this <strong>conscious tribalism.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tribalism is bad when the tribe and tribe member&#8217;s identity are one and the same. </strong>The tribe member&#8217;s identity is determined by whatever the tribe&#8217;s dogma happens to say. If the identity of the tribe changes, the identity of the tribe member changes with it in lockstep. The tribe member&#8217;s identity can&#8217;t change independent of the tribal identity because the member has no independent identity. Let&#8217;s call this <strong>blind tribalism.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">With conscious tribalism, the tribe member and his identity comes <em>first</em>. The tribe member&#8217;s identity is the alpha dog, and <em>who he is determines the tribes he&#8217;s in.</em> With blind tribalism, the tribe comes first. The tribe is the alpha dog and <em>it&#8217;s the tribe that determines who he is.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">This isn&#8217;t black and white—it&#8217;s a spectrum—but when someone is raised without strong reasoning skills, they may also lack a strong independent identity and end up vulnerable to the blind tribalism side of things—especially with the various tribes they were born into. That&#8217;s what Einstein was getting at when he said, &#8220;Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">A large tribe like a religion or nation or political party will contain members who fall across the whole range of the blind-to-conscious spectrum. But some tribes themselves will be the type to attract a certain type of follower. It makes logical sense that the more rigid and certain and <em>dogmatic</em> the tribe, the more likely it&#8217;ll be to attract blind tribe members. ISIS is going to have a far higher percentage of blind tribe members than the London Philosophy Club.</p><p class=\"p1\">The allure of dogmatic tribes makes sense—they appeal to very core parts of human nature.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans crave connection and camaraderie, and a guiding dogma is a common glue to bond together a group of unique individuals as one.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans want internal security, and for someone who grows up feeling shaky about their own distinctive character, a tribe and its guiding dogma is a critical lifeline—a one-stop shop for a full suite of human opinions and values.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans also long for the comfort and safety of certainty, and nowhere is conviction more present than in the groupthink of blind tribalism. While a scientist&#8217;s data-based opinions are only as strong as the evidence she has and inherently subject to change, tribal dogmatism is an exercise in faith, and with no data to be beholden to, blind tribe members believe what they believe with certainty.</p><p class=\"p1\">We discussed why math has proofs, science has theories, and in life, we should probably limit ourselves to hypotheses—but blind tribalism proceeds with the confidence of the mathematician:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (because the tribe says so): </strong>A = B<br /><strong>Given <strong>(because the tribe says so)</strong>:</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore, with certainty:</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">And since so many others in the tribe feel certain about things, your own certainty is reassured and reinforced.</p><p>But there&#8217;s a heavy cost to these comforts. Insecurity can be solved the hard way or the easy way—and by giving people the easy option, dogmatic tribes remove the pressure to do the hard work of evolving into a more independent person with a more internally-defined identity. In that way, dogmatic tribes are an <i>enabler</i> of the blind tribe member&#8217;s deficiencies.</p><p class=\"p1\">The sneaky thing about both rigid tribal dogma and blind membership is that they like to masquerade as open-minded thought with conscious membership. I think many of us may be closer to the blind membership side of things with certain tribes we&#8217;re a part of than we recognize—and those tribes we&#8217;re a part of may not be as open-minded as we tend to think.</p><p>A good test for this is the intensity of the <em>us </em>factor. That key word in &#8220;People like us do stuff like this&#8221; can get you into trouble pretty quickly.</p><p>Us feels great. A major part of the appeal of being in a tribe is that you get to be part of an Us, something humans are wired to seek out. And a loose Us is nice—like the Us among conscious, independent tribe members.</p><p>But the Us in blind tribalism is creepy. In blind tribalism, the tribe&#8217;s guiding dogma doubles as the identity of the tribe members, and the Us factor enforces that concept. Conscious tribe members reach conclusions—blind tribe members <em>are</em> conclusions. With a blind Us, if the way you are as an individual happens to contain opinions, traits, or principles that fall outside the outer edges of the dogma walls, they will need to be shed—or things will get ugly. By challenging the dogma of your tribe, you&#8217;re challenging both the sense of certainty the tribe members gain their strength from and the clear lines of identity they rely on.</p><p>The best friend of a blind Us is a nemesis Us—<em>Them</em>. Nothing unites Us like a collectively hated anti-Us, and the blind tribe is usually defined almost as much by hating the dogma of Them as it is by abiding by the dogma of Us.</p><p>Whatever element of rigid, identity-encompassing blindness is present in your own tribal life will reveal itself when you dare to validate any part of the rival Them dogma.</p><p>Give it a try. The next time you&#8217;re with a member of a tribe you&#8217;re a part of, express a change of heart that aligns you on a certain topic with whoever your tribe considers to be Them. If you&#8217;re a religious Christian, tell people at church you&#8217;re not sure anymore that there&#8217;s a God. If you&#8217;re an artist in Boulder, explain at the next dinner party that you think global warming might actually be a liberal hoax. If you&#8217;re an Iraqi, tell your family that you&#8217;re feeling pro-Israel lately. If you and your husband are staunch Republicans, tell him you&#8217;re coming around on Obamacare. If you&#8217;re from Boston, tell your friends you&#8217;re pulling for the Yankees this year because you like their current group of players.</p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re in a tribe with a blind mentality of total certainty, you&#8217;ll probably see a look of horror. It won&#8217;t just seem wrong, it&#8217;ll seem like <em>heresy</em>. They might get angry, they might passionately try to convince you otherwise, they might cut off the conversation—but there will be no open-minded conversation. And because identity is so intertwined with beliefs in blind tribalism, the person actually might feel less close to you afterwards. Because for rigidly tribal people, a shared dogma plays a more important role in their close relationships than they might recognize.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most of the major divides in our world emerge from blind tribalism, and on the extreme end of the spectrum—where people are complete <em>sheep</em>—blind tribalism can lead to terrifying things. Like those times in history when a few charismatic bad guys can build a large army of loyal foot soldiers just by displaying strength and passion. Because blind tribalism is the true villain behind our grandest-scale atrocities:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Equations1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4444 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Equations1.png\" alt=\"Equations\" width=\"597\" height=\"175\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Most of us probably wouldn&#8217;t have joined the Nazi party, because most of us aren&#8217;t on the extreme end of the blind-to-conscious spectrum. But I don&#8217;t think many of us are on the <em>other</em> end either. Instead, we&#8217;re usually somewhere in the hazy middle—in the land of cooks.<a href=\"#footnote-5-4367\" id=\"note-5-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>The Cook and the Chef</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">The difference between the way Elon thinks and the way most people think is kind of like the difference between a cook and a chef.</p><p class=\"p1\">The words &#8220;cook&#8221; and &#8220;chef&#8221; seem kind of like synonyms. And in the real world, they&#8217;re often used interchangeably. But in this post, when I say chef, I don&#8217;t mean any ordinary chef. I mean the <em>trailblazing chef—</em>the kind of chef who <em>invents</em> recipes. And for our purposes, everyone else who enters a kitchen—all those who <em>follow</em> recipes—is a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">Everything you eat—every part of every cuisine we know so well—was at some point in the past created for the <em>first time</em>. Wheat, tomatoes, salt, and milk go back a long time, but at some point, <em>someone</em> said, &#8220;What if I take those ingredients and do this&#8230;and this&#8230;..and this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; and ended up with the world&#8217;s first pizza. That&#8217;s the work of a chef.</p><p class=\"p1\">Since then, god knows how many people have made a pizza. That&#8217;s the work of a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">The chef reasons from first principles, and for the chef, the first principles are raw edible ingredients. Those are her puzzle pieces, her building blocks, and she works her way upwards from there, using her experience, her instincts, and her taste buds.</p><p class=\"p1\">The cook works off of some version of what&#8217;s already out there—a recipe of some kind, a meal she tried and liked, a dish she watched someone else make.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cooks span a wide range. On one end, you have cooks who only cook by following a recipe to the T<em>—</em>carefully measuring every ingredient exactly the way the recipe dictates. The result is a delicious meal that tastes exactly the way the recipe has it designed. Down the range a bit, you have more of a confident cook—someone with experience who gets the general gist of the recipe and then uses her skills and instincts to do it her own way. The result is something a little more unique to her style that tastes like the recipe but not quite. At the far end of the cook range, you have an innovator who makes her own concoctions. A lamb burger with a vegetable bun, a peanut butter and jelly pizza, a cinnamon pumpkin seed cake.<a href=\"#footnote-6-4367\" id=\"note-6-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p class=\"p1\">But what all of these cooks have in common is their starting point is something that already exists. Even the innovative cook is still making an iteration of a burger, a pizza, and a cake.</p><p class=\"p1\">At the very end of the spectrum, you have the chef. A chef might make good food or terrible food, but whatever she makes, it&#8217;s a result of her own reasoning process, from the selection of raw ingredients at the bottom to the finished dish at the top.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Spectrum2.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4456 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Spectrum2.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Spectrum\" width=\"598\" height=\"219\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">In the culinary world, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a cook. Most people are cooks because for most people, inventing recipes isn&#8217;t a goal of theirs.</p><p class=\"p1\">But in life—when it comes to the reasoning &#8220;recipes&#8221; we use to churn out a decision—we may want to think twice about where we are on the cook-chef spectrum.</p><p class=\"p1\">On a typical day, a &#8220;reasoning cook&#8221; and a &#8220;reasoning chef&#8221; don&#8217;t operate that differently. Even the chef becomes quickly exhausted by the mental energy required for first principles reasoning, and usually, doing so isn&#8217;t worth his time. Both types of people spend an average day with their brain software running on auto-pilot and their conscious decision-making centers dormant.</p><p class=\"p1\">But then comes a day when something new needs to be figured out. Maybe the cook and the chef are each given the new task at work to create a better marketing strategy. Or maybe they&#8217;re unhappy with that job and want to think of what business to start. Maybe they have a crush on someone they never expected to have feelings for and they need to figure out what to do about it.</p><p class=\"p1\">Whatever this new situation is, auto-pilot won&#8217;t suffice—this is something new and neither the chef&#8217;s nor the cook&#8217;s software has done this before. Which leaves only two options:</p><p class=\"p1\">Create. Or copy.</p><p class=\"p1\">The chef says, &#8220;Ugh okay, here we go,&#8221; rolls up his sleeves, and does what he always does in these situations—he switches on the active decision-making part of his software and starts to go to work. He looks at what data he has and seeks out what more he needs. He thinks about the current state of the world and reflects on where his values and priorities lie. He gathers together those relevant first principles ingredients and starts puzzling together a reasoning pathway. It takes some hard work, but eventually, the pathway brings him to a hypothesis. He knows it&#8217;s probably wrong-ish, and as new data emerges, he&#8217;ll &#8220;taste-test&#8221; the hypothesis and adjust it. He keeps the decision-making center on standby for the next few weeks as he makes a bunch of early adjustments to the flawed hypothesis—a little more salt, a little less sugar, one prime ingredient that needs to be swapped out for another. Eventually, he&#8217;s satisfied enough with how things are going to move back into auto-pilot mode. This new decision is now part of the automated routine—a new recipe is in the cookbook—and he&#8217;ll check in on it to make adjustments every once in a while or as new pertinent data comes in, the way he does for all parts of his software.</p><p class=\"p1\">The cook has no idea what&#8217;s going on in the last paragraph. The reasoning cook&#8217;s software is called &#8220;Because the recipe said so,&#8221; and it&#8217;s more of a computerized catalog of recipes than a computer program. When the cook needs to make a life decision, he goes through his collection of authority-written recipes, finds the one he trusts in that particular walk of life, and reads through the steps to see what to do—kind of like WWJD, except the J is replaced by whatever authority is most trusted in that area. For most questions, the authority is the tribe, since the cook&#8217;s tribal dogma covers most standard decisions. But in this particular case, the cook leafed through the tribe&#8217;s cookbook and couldn&#8217;t find any section about this type of decision. So he needs to get a hold of a recipe from another authority he trusts with this type of thing. Once the cook finds the right recipe, he can put it in his catalog and use it for all future decisions on this matter.</p><p class=\"p1\">First, the cook tries a few friends. His catalog doesn&#8217;t have the needed info, but maybe one of theirs does. He asks them for their advice—not so he can use it as additional thinking to supplement his own, but so it can <em>become </em>his own thinking.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that doesn&#8217;t yield any strongly-opinionated results, he&#8217;ll go to the trusty eternal backstop—conventional wisdom.</p><p class=\"p1\">Society as a whole is its own loose tribe, often spanning your whole nation or even your whole part of the world, and what we call &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; is its guiding dogma cookbook—online and available to the public. Typically, the larger the tribe, the more general and more outdated the dogma—and the conventional wisdom database runs like a DMV website last updated in 1992. But when the cook has nowhere else to turn, it&#8217;s like a trusty old friend.</p><p class=\"p1\">And in this case—let&#8217;s say the cook is thinking of starting a business and wants to know what the possibilities are—conventional wisdom has him covered. He types the command into the interface, waits a few minutes, and then the system pumps out its answer:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CWDOS1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4447 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CWDOS1.png\" alt=\"CWDOS\" width=\"562\" height=\"403\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The cook, thoroughly discouraged, thanks the machine and updates his Reality box accordingly.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cook-reality-box-simple.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4445 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cook-reality-box-simple.png\" alt=\"Cook reality box simple\" width=\"282\" height=\"249\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">With the decision made (not to start a business), he switches his software back into auto-pilot mode. Done and done.</p><p class=\"p1\">Musk calls the cook&#8217;s way of thinking &#8220;reasoning by analogy&#8221; (as opposed to reasoning by first principles), which is a nice euphemism. The next time a kid gets caught copying answers from another student&#8217;s exam during the test, he should just explain that he was reasoning by analogy.</p><p class=\"p1\">If you start looking for it, you&#8217;ll see the chef/cook thing happening everywhere. There are chefs and cooks in the worlds of music, art, technology, architecture,<a href=\"#footnote-7-4367\" id=\"note-7-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> writing, business, comedy, marketing, app development, football coaching, teaching, and military strategy. And in each case, though both parties are usually just on autopilot, mindlessly playing the latest album again and again at concerts, it&#8217;s in those key moments when it&#8217;s time to <em>write </em>a new album—those moments of truth in front of a clean canvas, a blank Word doc, an empty playbook, a new sheet of blueprint paper, a fresh whiteboard—that the chef and the cook reveal their true colors. The chef creates while the cook, in some form or another, copies.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Line-of-cooks.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4395 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Line-of-cooks.png\" alt=\"Line of cooks\" width=\"515\" height=\"355\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">And the difference in outcome is enormous. For cooks, even the more innovative kind, there&#8217;s almost always a ceiling on the size of the splash they can make in the world, unless there&#8217;s some serious luck involved. Chefs aren&#8217;t guaranteed to do anything good, but when there&#8217;s a little talent and a lot of persistence, they&#8217;re almost certain<em> </em>to make a splash. Sometimes the chef is the one brave enough to go for something big—but other times, someone doesn&#8217;t feel the desire to make a splash and the chef is the one with the strength of character to step out of the game and in favor of keeping it small. Being a chef isn&#8217;t being like Elon Musk—it&#8217;s being yourself.</p><p class=\"p1\">No one talks about the &#8220;reasoning industry,&#8221; but we&#8217;re all part of it, and when it comes to chefs and cooks, it&#8217;s no different than any other industry. We&#8217;re working in the reasoning industry every time we make a decision.</p><p class=\"p1\">Your current life, with all its facets and complexity, is like a reasoning industry album. The question is, how did that set of songs come to be? How were the songs composed, and by whom? And in those critical do-or-die moments when it&#8217;s time to write a new song, how do you do your creating? Do you dig deep into yourself? Do you start with the drumbeat and chords of an existing song and write your own melody on top of it? Do you just play covers?</p><p class=\"p1\">I know what you <em>want </em>the answers to these questions to be. This is a straightforward one—it&#8217;s clearly better to be a chef. But unlike the case with most major distinctions in life—hard-working vs. lazy, ethical vs. dishonest, considerate vs. selfish—when the chef/cook distinction passes right in front of us, we often don&#8217;t even notice it&#8217;s there.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Missing the Distinction</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Like the culinary world&#8217;s cook-to-chef range, the real world&#8217;s cook-to-chef range isn&#8217;t binary—it lies on a spectrum:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4529\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum3.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Life Spectrum\" width=\"600\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">But I&#8217;m pretty sure that when most of us look at that spectrum, we <em>think </em>we&#8217;re farther to the right than we actually are. We&#8217;re usually more cook-like than we realize—we just can&#8217;t see it from where we&#8217;re standing.</p><p class=\"p1\">For example—</p><p class=\"p1\">Cooks are followers—by definition. They&#8217;re a cook because in whatever they&#8217;re doing, they&#8217;re following some kind of recipe. But most of us don&#8217;t think of ourselves as followers.</p><p class=\"p1\">A follower, we think, is a weakling with no mind of their own. We think about leadership positions we&#8217;ve held and initiatives we&#8217;ve taken at work and the way we never let friends boss us around, and we take these as evidence that we&#8217;re no follower. Which in turn means that we&#8217;re not just a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the problem is—the only thing all of that proves is that you&#8217;re no follower <em>within your tribe</em>. As Einstein meanly put it:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, you might be a star and a leader in your world or in the eyes of your part of society, but if the core reason you picked that goal in the first place was because your tribe&#8217;s cookbook says that it&#8217;s an impressive thing and it makes the other tribe members gawk, <em>you&#8217;re not being a leader—you&#8217;re being a super-successful follower. </em>And, as Einstein says, no less of a cook than all those whom you&#8217;ve impressed.</p><p class=\"p1\">To see the truth, you need to zoom way out until you can see the real leader of the cooks—the cookbook.</p><p>But we don&#8217;t tend to zoom out, and when we look around at our life, zoomed in, what appears to be a highly unique and independent self may be an optical illusion.<a href=\"#footnote-8-4367\" id=\"note-8-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> What often feels like independent reasoning when zoomed out is actually playing connect-the-dots on a pre-printed set of steps laid out by someone else. What feels like personal principles might just be the general tenets of your tribe. What feels like original opinions may have actually been spoon-fed to us by the media or our parents or friends or our religion or a celebrity. What feels like Roark might actually be Keating. What feels like our chosen life path could just be one of a handful of pre-set, tribe-approved yellow brick roads. What feels like creativity might be filling in a coloring book—and making sure to stay inside the lines.</p><p>Because of this optical illusion, we&#8217;re unable to see the flaws in our own thinking or recognize an unusually great thinker when we see one. Instead, when a superbly science-minded, independent-thinking chef like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein comes around, what do we attribute their success to?</p><p>Awesome fucking hardware.</p><p>When we look at Musk, we see someone with genius, with vision, with superhuman balls. All things, we assume, he was more or less born with. So to us, the spectrum looks more like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum-Skewed1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4455 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum-Skewed1.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Life Spectrum Skewed\" width=\"598\" height=\"219\" /></a></p><p>The way we see it, we&#8217;re all a bunch of independent-thinking chefs—and it&#8217;s just that Musk is a really impressive chef.</p><p>Which is both A) overrating Musk and B) overrating ourselves. And <em>completely</em> missing the real story.</p><p>Musk is an impressive chef for sure, but what makes him such an extreme standout isn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s impressive—<em>it&#8217;s that most of us aren&#8217;t chefs at all.</em></p><p>It&#8217;s like a bunch of typewriters looking at a computer and saying, &#8220;Man, that is one talented typewriter.&#8221;</p><p>The reason we have such a hard time seeing what&#8217;s really going on is that we don&#8217;t get that brain software is even a <em>thing</em>. We don&#8217;t think of brains as computers, so we don&#8217;t think about the distinction between hardware and software at all. When we think about the brain, we think only about the hardware—the thing we&#8217;re born with and are powerless to change or improve. Much less tangible to us is the concept of how we reason. We see reasoning as a thing that just kind of <em>happens</em>, like our bodies&#8217; blood flow—it&#8217;s a process that automatically happens, and there&#8217;s not much else to say or do about it.</p><p>And if we can&#8217;t even see the hardware/software distinction, we certainly can&#8217;t see the more nuanced chef software vs. cook software distinction.</p><p>By not seeing our thinking software for what it is—a <em>critical </em>life skill, something that can be learned, practiced, and improved, and the major factor that separates the people who do great things from those who don&#8217;t—we fail to realize where the game of life is really being played. We don&#8217;t recognize reasoning as a thing that can be created or copied—and in the same way that causes us to mistake our own cook-like behavior for independent reasoning, we then mistake the actual independent reasoning of the chef for exceptional and magical abilities.</p><p>Three examples:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) We mistake the chef&#8217;s clear view of the present for vision into the future.</strong></span></p><p>Musk&#8217;s sister Tosca said &#8220;Elon has already gone to the future and come back to tell us what he&#8217;s found.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-9-4367\" id=\"note2-9-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> This is how a lot of people feel about Musk—that he&#8217;s a visionary, that he can somehow see things we cannot. We see it like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4458 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-1.jpg\" alt=\"Musk Visionary 1\" width=\"519\" height=\"266\" /></a></p><p>But actually, it&#8217;s like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4459 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-2.jpg\" alt=\"Musk Visionary 2\" width=\"516\" height=\"291\" /></a></p><p>Conventional wisdom is slow to move, and there&#8217;s significant lag time between when something becomes reality and when conventional wisdom is revised to reflect that reality. And by the time it does, reality has moved on to something else. But chefs don&#8217;t pay attention to that, reasoning instead using their eyes and ears and experience. By ignoring conventional wisdom in favor of simply looking at the present for what it really is and staying up-to-date with the facts of the world as they change in real-time—in spite of what conventional wisdom has to say—the chef can act on information the rest of us haven&#8217;t been given permission to act on yet.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) We mistake the chef&#8217;s accurate understanding of risk for courage.</strong></span></p><p>Remember this ElonSpeak quote from earlier?</p><p><em>When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it&#8217;s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn&#8217;t afraid of the dark anymore after that.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-10-4367\" id=\"note2-10-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p>That&#8217;s just a kid chef assessing the actual facts of a situation and deciding that his fear was misplaced.</p><p>As an adult, Musk said this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Sometimes people fear starting a company too much. Really, what’s the worst that could go wrong? You’re not gonna starve to death, you&#8217;re not gonna die of exposure—what’s the worst that could go wrong?</em><a href=\"#footnote2-11-4367\" id=\"note2-11-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p>Same quote, right?</p><p>In both cases, Musk is essentially saying, &#8220;People consider X to be scary, but their fear is not based on logic, so I&#8217;m not scared of X.&#8221; That&#8217;s not courage—that&#8217;s logic.</p><p>Courage means doing something risky. Risk means exposing yourself to danger. We intuitively understand this—that&#8217;s why most of us wouldn&#8217;t call child Elon <em>courageous </em>for sleeping with the lights off. Courage would be a weird word to use there because no actual danger was involved.</p><p>All Elon&#8217;s saying in the second quote is that being scared to start a company is the adult version of being scared of the dark. It&#8217;s not actually dangerous.</p><p>So when Musk put his entire fortune down and on SpaceX and Tesla, he was being bold as fuck, but courageous? Not the right word. It was a case of a chef taking a bunch of information he had and puzzling together a plan that seemed logical. It&#8217;s not that he was sure he&#8217;d succeed—in fact, he thought SpaceX in particular had a reasonable probability of failure—it&#8217;s just that nowhere in his assessments did he foresee <em>danger</em>.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3) We mistake the chef&#8217;s originality for brilliant ingenuity. </strong></span></p><p>People believe thinking outside the box takes intelligence and creativity, but it&#8217;s mostly about independence. When you simply ignore the box and build your reasoning from scratch, whether you&#8217;re brilliant or not, you end up with a unique conclusion—one that may or may not fall within the box.</p><p>When you&#8217;re in a foreign country and you decide to ditch the guidebook and start wandering aimlessly and talking to people, unique things always end up happening. When people hear about those things, they think of you as a pro traveler and a bold adventurer—when all you really did is ditch the guidebook.</p><p>Likewise, when an artist or scientist or businessperson chef reasons independently instead of by analogy, and their puzzling happens to both A) turn out well and B) end up outside the box, people call it innovation and marvel at the chef&#8217;s ingenuity. When it turns out <em>really </em>well, all the cooks do what they do best—copy—and now it&#8217;s called a revolution.</p><p>Simply by refraining from reasoning by analogy, the chef opens up the possibility of making a huge splash with every project. When Steve Jobs<a href=\"#footnote-9-4367\" id=\"note-9-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> and Apple turned their attention to phones, they didn&#8217;t start by saying, &#8220;Okay well people seem to like this kind of keyboard more than that kind, and everyone seems unhappy with the difficulty of hitting the numbers on their keyboards—so let&#8217;s get creative and make the best phone keyboard yet!&#8221; They simply asked, &#8220;What should a mobile device be?&#8221; and in their from-scratch reasoning, a physical keyboard didn&#8217;t end up as part of the plan at all. It didn&#8217;t take genius to come up with the design of the iPhone—it&#8217;s actually pretty logical—it just took the ability to not copy.</p><p>Different version of the same story with the invention of the United States. When the American forefathers found themselves with a new country on their hands, they didn&#8217;t ask, &#8220;What should the rules be for selecting our king, and what should the limitations of his power be?&#8221; A king to them was what a physical keyboard was to Apple. Instead, they asked, &#8220;What should a country be and what&#8217;s the best way to govern a group of people?&#8221; and by the time they had finished their puzzling, a king wasn&#8217;t part of the picture—their first principles reasoning led them to believe that John Locke had a better plan and they worked their way up from there.</p><p>History is full of the stories of chefs creating revolutions of apparent ingenuity through simple first principles reasoning. Genghis Khan organizing a smattering of tribes that had been fragmented for centuries using a <a href=\"http://www.alanculler.com/Genghis%20Khan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">powers of ten system</a> in order to build one grand tribe that could sweep the world. Henry Ford creating cars with the out-of-the-box manufacturing technique of assembly-line production in order to bring cars to the masses for the first time. Marie Curie using unconventional methods to pioneer the theory of radioactivity and topple the &#8220;atoms are indivisible&#8221; assumption on its head (she won a Nobel Prize in both physics and chemistry—two prizes reserved exclusively for chefs). Martin Luther King taking a nonviolent Thoreau approach to a situation normally addressed by riots. Larry Page and Sergey Brin ignoring the commonly-used methods of searching the internet in favor of what they saw as a more logical system that based page importance on the number of important sites that linked to it. The 1966 Beatles deciding to stop being the world&#8217;s best cooks, ditching the typical songwriting styles of early-60s bands, including their own, and become music chefs, creating a bunch of new types of songs from scratch that no one had heard before.</p><p>Whatever the time, place, or industry, anytime something <em>really </em>big happens, there&#8217;s almost always an experimenting chef at the center of it—not being anything magical, just trusting their brain and working from scratch. Our world, like our cuisines, was created by these people—the rest of us are just along for the ride.</p><p>Yeah, Musk is smart as fuck and insanely ambitious—but that&#8217;s not why he&#8217;s beating everybody. What makes Musk so rad is that he&#8217;s a software outlier. A chef in a world of cooks. A science geologist in a world of flood geologists. A brain software pro in a world where people don&#8217;t realize brain software is a thing.</p><p>That&#8217;s Elon Musk&#8217;s secret sauce.</p><p>Which is why the real story here isn&#8217;t Musk. It&#8217;s us.</p><p>The real puzzle in this series isn&#8217;t why Elon Musk is trying to end the era of gas cars or why he&#8217;s trying to land a rocket or why he cares so much about colonizing Mars—it&#8217;s why Elon Musk is so <em>rare</em>.</p><p>The curious thing about the car industry isn&#8217;t why Tesla is focusing so hard on electric cars, and the curious thing about the aerospace industry isn&#8217;t why SpaceX is trying so hard to make rockets reusable—the fascinating question is why they&#8217;re the only companies doing so.</p><p>We spent this whole time trying to figure out the mysterious workings of the mind of a madman genius only to realize that Musk&#8217;s secret sauce is that he&#8217;s the only one being normal. And in isolation, Musk would be a pretty boring subject—it&#8217;s the backdrop of <em>us</em> that makes him interesting. And it&#8217;s that backdrop that this series is really about.</p><p>So&#8230;what&#8217;s the deal with us? How did we end up so scared and cook-like? And how do we learn to be more like the chefs of the world, who seem to so effortlessly carve their own way through life? I think it comes down to three things.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>How to Be a Chef</strong></span></p><p>Anytime there&#8217;s a curious phenomenon within humanity—some collective insanity we&#8217;re all suffering from—it usually ends up being evolution&#8217;s fault. This story is no different.</p><p class=\"p1\">When it comes to reasoning, we&#8217;re biologically inclined to be cooks, not chefs, which relates back to our tribal evolutionary past. First, it&#8217;s a better tribal model for most people to be cooks. In 50,000 BC, tribes full of independent thinkers probably suffered from having too many chefs in the kitchen, which would lead to too many arguments and factions within the tribe. A tribe with a strong leader at the top and the rest of the members simply following the leader would fare better. So those types of tribes passed on their genes more than other tribes. And now we&#8217;re the collective descendants of the more cook-like people.</p><p>Second, it&#8217;s about our own well-being. It&#8217;s not in our DNA to be chefs because human self-preservation never depended upon independent thinking—it rode on fitting in with the tribe, on staying in favor with the chief, on following in the footsteps of the elders who knew more about staying alive than we did, and on teaching our children to do the same—which is why we now live in a cook society where cook parents raise their kids by telling them to follow the recipe and stop asking questions about it.</p><p>Thinking like cooks is what we&#8217;re born to do because what we&#8217;re born to do is survive.</p><p>But the weird thing is, we weren&#8217;t born into a normal human world. We&#8217;re living in the anomaly, when for many of the world&#8217;s people, survival is easy. Today&#8217;s privileged societies are full of anomaly humans whose primary purpose is already taken care of, softening the deafening roar of unmet base needs and allowing the nuanced and complex voice of our inner selves to awaken.</p><p>The problem is, most of our heads are still running on some version of the 50,000-year-old survival software—which kind of wastes the good luck we have to be born now.</p><p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate catch-22—we continue to think like cooks because we can&#8217;t absorb the epiphany that we live in an anomaly world where there&#8217;s no need to be cooks, and we can&#8217;t absorb that epiphany because we think like cooks and cooks don&#8217;t know how to challenge and update their own software.</p><p>This is the vicious cycle of our time—and the secret of the chef is that they somehow snapped out of it.</p><p>So how do we snap out of the trance?</p><p>I think there are three major epiphanies we need to absorb—three core things the chef knows that the cook doesn&#8217;t:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 1) You don&#8217;t know shit.</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/You-dont-know-shit.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4403 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/You-dont-know-shit.png\" alt=\"You don't know shit\" width=\"316\" height=\"278\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The flood geologists of the 17th and 18th centuries weren&#8217;t stupid. And they weren&#8217;t anti-science. Many of them were just as accomplished in their fields as their science geologist colleagues.</p><p>But they were victims—victims of a religious dogma they were told to believe without question. The recipe they followed was scripture, a recipe that turned out to be wrong. And as a result, they proceeded on their path with a fatal flaw in their thinking—a software bug that told them that one of the undeniable first principles when thinking about the Earth was that it began 6,000 years ago and that there had been a flood of the most epic proportions.</p><p>With that software bug in place, all further computations were moot. Any reasoning tree that puzzled upwards with those assumptions at its root had no chance of finding truth.</p><p>Even more than being victims of any dogma, the flood geologists were victims of their own certainty. Without certainty, dogma has no power. And when data is required in order to believe something, false dogma has no legs to stand on. It wasn&#8217;t the church dogma<em> </em>that hindered the flood geologists, it was the church <em>mentality</em> of faith-based certainty.</p><p>That&#8217;s what Stephen Hawking meant when he said, &#8220;The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.&#8221; Neither the science geologist nor the flood geologist started off with knowledge. But what gave the science geologist the power to seek out the truth was <em>knowing </em>that he lacked knowledge. The science geologists subscribed to the <em>lab</em> mentality, which starts by saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know shit&#8221; and works upwards from there.</p><p>If you want to see the lab mentality at work, just search for famous quotes of any prominent scientist and you&#8217;ll see each one of them expressing the fact that they don&#8217;t know shit.</p><p>Here&#8217;s Isaac Newton: <em>To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.</em></p><p>And Richard Feynman: <em>I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.</em></p><p>And Niels Bohr: <i>Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.</i></p><p>Musk has said his own version: <em>You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-12-4367\" id=\"note2-12-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p>The reason these outrageously smart people are so humble about what they know is that as scientists, they&#8217;re aware that unjustified certainty is the bane of understanding and the death of effective reasoning. They firmly believe that reasoning of all kinds should take place in a lab, not a church.</p><p>If we want to become more chef-like, we have to make sure we&#8217;re doing our thinking in a lab. Which means identifying which parts of our thinking are currently sitting in church.</p><p>But that&#8217;s a hard thing to do because m<span class=\"s1\">ost of us have the same relationship with our own software that my grandmother has with her computer:<a href=\"#footnote-10-4367\" id=\"note-10-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> It&#8217;s this thing someone put there, we use it when we need to, it somehow magically works, and we hope it doesn&#8217;t break. It&#8217;s the way we are with a lot of the things we own, where we&#8217;re just the dumb user, not the pro. We know how to use our car, microwave, phone, our electric toothbrush, but if something breaks, we take it to the pro to fix it because we have no idea how it works.</span></p><p>But that&#8217;s not a great life model when it comes to brain software, and it usually leads to us making the same mistakes and living with the same results year after year after year, because our software remains unchanged. Eventually, we might wake up one day feeling like <i>Breaking Bad&#8217;s </i>Walter White, when he said, &#8220;Sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own&#8230; choices. I mean, my entire life it just seems I never&#8230; had a real say about any of it.&#8221; If we want to understand our own thinking, we have to stop being the dumb user of our own software and start being the pro—the auto mechanic, the electrician, the computer geek.</p><p>If you were alone in a room with a car and wanted to figure out how it worked, you&#8217;d probably start by taking it apart as much as you could and examining the parts and how they all fit together. To do the same with our thinking, we need to revert to our four-year-old selves and start deconstructing our software by resuming the Why game our parents and teachers shut down decades ago. It&#8217;s time to roll up our sleeves, pop open the hood, and get our hands dirty with a bunch of not-that-fun questions about what we truly want, what&#8217;s truly possible, and whether the way we&#8217;re living our lives follows logically from those things.</p><p>With each of these questions, the challenge is to keep asking why until you hit the floor—and the floor is what will tell you whether you&#8217;re in a church or a lab for that particular part of your life. If a floor you hit is one or more first principles that represent the truth of reality or your inner self and the logic going upwards stays accurate to that foundation, you&#8217;re in the lab. If a Why? pathway hits a floor called &#8220;Because [authority] said so&#8221;—if you go down and down and realize at the bottom that the whole thing is just because you&#8217;re taking your parent&#8217;s or friend&#8217;s or religion&#8217;s or society&#8217;s word for it—then you&#8217;re in church there. And if the tenets of that church don&#8217;t truly resonate with you or reflect the current reality of the world—if it turns out that you’ve been working off of the wrong recipe—then whatever conclusions have been built on top of it will be just as wrong. As demonstrated by the flood geologists, a reasoning chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4465 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-1.jpg\" alt=\"False Dogma 1\" width=\"363\" height=\"386\" /></a></p><p>Astronomers once hit a similar wall in their progress trying to calculate the trajectories of the sun and planets in the Solar System. Then one day they discovered that the sun was at the center of things, not the Earth, and suddenly, all the perplexing calculations made sense, and progress leapt forward. Had they played the Why game earlier, they&#8217;d have run into a dogmatic floor right after the question &#8220;But why do we know that the Earth is in the center of everything?&#8221;</p><p>People&#8217;s lives are no different, which is why it&#8217;s so important to find the toxic lumps of false dogma tucked inside the layers of your reasoning software. Identifying one and adjusting it can strengthen the whole chain above and create a breakthrough in your life.</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-4466 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-2.jpg\" alt=\"False Dogma 2\" width=\"364\" height=\"386\" /></p><p>The thing you really want to look closely for is unjustified certainty. Where in life do you feel so right about something that it doesn&#8217;t qualify as a hypothesis or even a theory, but it feels like a <em>proof?</em> When there&#8217;s proof-level certainty, it means either there&#8217;s some serious concrete and verified data underneath it—or it&#8217;s faith-based dogma. Maybe you feel certain that quitting your job would be a disaster or certain that there&#8217;s no god or certain that it&#8217;s important to go to college or certain that you&#8217;ve always had a great time on rugged vacations or certain that everyone loves it when you break out the guitar during a group hangout—but if it&#8217;s not well backed-up by data from what you&#8217;ve learned and experienced, it&#8217;s at best a hypothesis and at worst a completely false piece of dogma.</p><p>And if thinking about all of that ends with you drowning in some combination of self-doubt, self-loathing, and identity crisis, that&#8217;s perfect. This first epiphany is about humility. Humility is by definition a starting point—and it sends you off on a journey from there. The arrogance of certainty is both a starting point and an ending point—no journeys needed. That’s why it’s so important that we begin with &#8220;I don&#8217;t know shit.&#8221; That&#8217;s when we know we&#8217;re in the lab.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 2) No

18\" width=\"500\" height=\"612\" /></a></p><p>Yes, it&#8217;s an old classic. The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes. It was written in 1837 by Hans Christian Andersen<a href=\"#footnote-11-4367\" id=\"note-11-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> to demonstrate a piece of trademark human insanity: the &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t seem right to me but everyone else says it&#8217;s right so it must be right and I&#8217;ll just pretend I also think it&#8217;s right so no one realizes I&#8217;m stupid&#8221; phenomenon.</p><p>My favorite all-time quote might be Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEiSa6_EPA\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> this:</p><p><em>When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you&#8217;ll never be the same again.</em><a href=\"#footnote-12-4367\" id=\"note-12-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a><p>This is Jobs&#8217; way of saying, &#8220;You might not know shit. But <em>no </em>one knows shit. If the emperor looks naked to you and everyone else is saying he has clothes, trust your eyes since other people don&#8217;t know anything you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s an easy message to understand, a harder one to believe, and an even harder one to act on.</p><p>The purpose of the first epiphany is to shatter the belief that all that dogma you&#8217;ve memorized constitutes personal opinions and wisdom and all that certainty you feel constitutes knowledge and understanding. That&#8217;s the easier one because the delusion that we know what we&#8217;re talking about is pretty fragile, with the &#8220;Oh god I&#8217;m a fraud who doesn&#8217;t know shit&#8221; monster never lurking too far under our consciousness.</p><p>But this epiphany—that the collective &#8220;other people&#8221; and their conventional wisdom don&#8217;t know shit—is a much larger challenge. Our delusion about the wisdom of those around us, our tribe, and society as a whole is much thicker and runs much deeper than the delusion about ourselves. So deep that we&#8217;ll see a naked emperor and ignore our own eyes if everyone else says he has clothes on.</p><p>This is a battle of two kinds of confidence—confidence in others vs. confidence in ourselves. For most cooks, confidence in others usually comes out the winner.</p><p>To swing the balance, we need to figure out how to <em>lose respect</em> for the general public, your tribe&#8217;s dogma, and society&#8217;s conventional wisdom. We have a bunch of romantic words for the world’s chefs that sound impressive but are actually just a result of them having lost this respect. Being a <em>gamechanger </em>is just having little enough respect for the game that you realize there’s no good reason not to change the rules. Being a <em>trailblazer</em> is just not respecting the beaten path and so deciding to blaze yourself a new one. Being a <em>groundbreaker</em> is just knowing that the ground wasn’t laid by anyone that impressive and so feeling no need to keep it intact.</p><p>Not respecting society is totally counterintuitive to what we&#8217;re taught when we grow up—but it makes perfect sense if you just look at what your eyes and experience tell you.</p><p>There are clues all around showing us that conventional wisdom doesn&#8217;t know shit. Conventional wisdom worships the status quo and always assumes that everything is the way it is for a good reason—and history is one long record of status quo dogma being proven wrong again and again, every time some chef comes around and changes things.</p><p>And if you open your eyes, there are other clues all through your own life that the society you live in is nothing to be intimidated by. All the times you learn about what really goes on inside a company and find out that it&#8217;s totally disorganized and badly run. All the people in high places who can&#8217;t seem to get their personal lives together. All the well-known sitcoms whose jokes you&#8217;re pretty sure you could have written when you were 14. All the politicians who don&#8217;t seem to know more about the world than you do.</p><p>And yet, the delusion that society knows shit that you don&#8217;t runs deep, and still, somewhere in the back of your head, you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic that you<em> </em>could ever actually build that company, achieve that fabulous wealth or celebrity-status, create that TV show, win that senate campaign—no matter what<em> </em>it <em>seems</em> like.</p><p>Sometimes it takes an actual experience to fully expose society for the shit it doesn&#8217;t know. One example from my life is how I slowly came to understand that most Americans—the broader public, my tribe, and people I know well—knew very little about what it&#8217;s actually like to visit most countries. I grew up hearing about how dangerous it was to visit really foreign places, especially alone. But when I started going places I wasn&#8217;t supposed to go, I kept finding that the conventional wisdom had been plain wrong about it. As I had more experiences and gathered more actual data, I grew increasingly trusting of my own reasoning over whatever Americans were saying. And as my confidence grew, places like Thailand and Spain turned into places like Oman and Uzbekistan which turned into places like Nigeria and North Korea. When it comes to traveling, I had the epiphany: other people&#8217;s strong opinions about this are based on unbacked-up dogma and the fact that most people I talk to feel the same way means nothing if my own research, experience, and selective question-asking brings me to a different conclusion.<a href=\"#footnote-13-4367\" id=\"note-13-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a> When it comes to picking travel destinations, I&#8217;ve become a chef.</p><p>I try to leverage what I learned as a traveler to transfer the chefness elsewhere—when I find myself discouraged in another part of my life by the warnings and head-shaking of conventional wisdom, I try to remind myself: <em>&#8220;These are the same people that were sure that North Korea was dangerous.&#8221; </em>It&#8217;s hard—you have to take the leap to chefdom separately in each part of your life—but it seems like with each successive cook → chef breakthrough, future breakthroughs become easier to come by. <span class=\"s1\">Eventually, you must hit a tipping point and trusting your own software becomes your way of life—and as Jobs says, you&#8217;ll never be the same again.</span></p><p>The first epiphany was about shattering a protective shell of arrogance to lay bare a starting point of humility. This second epiphany is about confidence—the confidence to emerge from that humility through a pathway built on first principles instead of by analogy. It&#8217;s a confidence that says, &#8220;I may not know much, but no one else does either, so I might as well be the most knowledgeable person on Earth.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 3) You&#8217;re playing Grand Theft Life</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grand-Theft-Life.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4394 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grand-Theft-Life.png\" alt=\"Grand Theft Life\" width=\"270\" height=\"298\" /></a></p><p>The first two epiphanies allow us to break open our software, identify which parts of it were put there by someone else, and with confidence begin to fill in the Want and Reality boxes with our own handwriting and choose a goal and a strategy that&#8217;s right for us.</p><p>But then we hit a snag. We&#8217;re finally in the lab with all our tools and equipment, but something holds us back. To figure out why, let&#8217;s bring back our emperor story.</p><p>When the emperor struts out with his shoulder hair and his gut and his little white junk, the story only identifies two kinds of people: the mass of subjects, who all pretend they can see the clothes, and the kid, who just says that the dude is obviously naked.</p><p>But I think there&#8217;s more going on. In an emperor&#8217;s new clothes situation, there are <em>four </em>kinds of people:</p><p><strong>1) Proud Cook. </strong>Proud Cook is the person drinking the full dogma Kool-Aid. Whatever independent-thinking voice <em>is</em> inside of Proud Cook was silenced long ago, and there&#8217;s no distinction between his thoughts and the dogma he follows. As far as he&#8217;s concerned, the dogma is truth—but since he doesn&#8217;t even register that there&#8217;s any dogma happening, Proud Cook simply thinks he&#8217;s a very wise person who has it all figured out. He feels the certainty of the dogma running through his veins. When the emperor walks out and proclaims that he is wearing beautiful new clothes, Proud Cook actually <em>sees</em> clothes, because his consciousness isn&#8217;t even turned on.</p><p><strong>2) Insecure Cook. </strong>Insecure Cook is what Proud Cook turns into after undergoing Epiphany #1. Insecure Cook has had a splash of self-awareness—enough to become conscious of the fact that he doesn&#8217;t actually know why he&#8217;s so certain about the things he&#8217;s certain about. Whatever the reasons are, he&#8217;s sure they&#8217;re right, but he can&#8217;t seem to come up with them himself. Without the blissful arrogance of Proud Cook, Insecure Cook is lost in the world, wondering why he&#8217;s too dumb to get what everyone else gets and trying to watch others to figure out what he&#8217;s supposed to do—all while hoping nobody finds out that he doesn&#8217;t get it. When Insecure Cook sees the emperor, his heart sinks—he doesn&#8217;t <em>see </em>the clothes, only the straggly gray hairs of the emperor&#8217;s upper thighs. Ashamed, he reads the crowd and mimics their enthusiasm for the clothes.</p><p><strong>3) Self-Loathing Cook. </strong>Self-Loathing Cook is what Insecure Cook becomes after being hit by Epiphany #2. Epiphany #2 is the forbidden fruit, and Self-Loathing Cook has bitten it. He now knows <em>exactly </em>why he didn&#8217;t feel certain about everything—because it was all bullshit. He sees the tenets of conventional wisdom for what they really are—faith-based dogma. He knows that neither he nor anyone else knows shit and that he&#8217;ll get much farther riding his own reasoning than jumping on the bandwagon with the masses. When the emperor emerges, Self-Loathing Cook thinks, &#8220;Oh Jesus&#8230;this fucktard is actually outside with no clothes on. Oh—oh and my god these idiots are all <em>pretending to see clothes</em>. How is this my life? I need to move.&#8221;</p><p>But then, right when he&#8217;s about to call everyone out on their pretending and the emperor out on his bizarre life decision, there&#8217;s a lump in his throat. Sure, he knows there are no clothes on that emperor&#8217;s sweaty lower back fat roll—but actually <em>saying</em> that? Out <em>loud?</em> I mean, he&#8217;s sure and all—but let&#8217;s not go crazy here. Better not to call too much attention to himself. And of course, there&#8217;s a <em>chance</em> he&#8217;s missing something. Right?</p><p>Self-Loathing Cook ends up staying quiet and nodding at the other cooks when they ask him if those clothes aren&#8217;t just the most marvelous he&#8217;s ever seen.</p><p><b>4) The chef. </b>The kid in the story. The chef is Self-Loathing Cook—except without the irrational fear. The chef goes through the same inner thought process as Self-Loathing Cook, but when it&#8217;s time to walk the walk, the chef stands up and yells out the truth.</p><p>A visual recap:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-Subjects.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4382\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-Subjects.png\" alt=\"4 Subjects\" width=\"650\" height=\"333\" /></a></p><p>We&#8217;re all human and we&#8217;re all complex, which means that in various parts of each of our lives, we play each of these four characters.</p><p>But to me, Self-Loathing Cook is the most curious one of the four. Self-Loathing Cook gets it. He knows what the chefs know. He&#8217;s tantalizingly close to carving out his own chef path in the world, and he knows that if he just <em>goes</em> for it, good things would happen. But he can&#8217;t pull the trigger. He built himself a pair of wings he feels confident work just fine, but he can&#8217;t bring himself to jump off the cliff.</p><p>And as he stands there next to the cliff with the other cooks, he has to endure the torture of watching the chefs of the world leap off the edge with the same exact wings and flying skills he has, but with the courage he can&#8217;t seem to find.</p><p>To figure out what&#8217;s going on with Self-Loathing Cook, let&#8217;s remind ourselves how the chefs operate.</p><p>Free of Self-Loathing Cook&#8217;s trepidation, the world&#8217;s chefs are liberated to put on their lab coats and start sciencing. To a chef, the world is one giant laboratory, and their life is one long lab session full of a million experiments. They spend their days puzzling, and society is their game board.</p><p>The chef treats his goals and undertakings as experiments whose purpose is as much to learn new information as it is to be ends in themselves. That&#8217;s why when I asked Musk what his thoughts were on negative feedback, he answered with this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I’m a huge believer in taking feedback. I’m trying to create a mental model that’s accurate, and if I have a wrong view on something, or if there’s a nuanced improvement that can be made, I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;I used to think this one thing that turned out to be wrong—now thank goodness I don’t have that wrong belief.&#8221;</em></p><p class=\"p1\">To a chef in the lab, negative feedback is a free boost forward in progress, courtesy of someone else. Pure upside.</p><p class=\"p1\">As for the F word&#8230;the word that makes our amygdalae quiver in the moonlight, the great chefs have something to say about that too:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. </em>—Henry Ford</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.</em> —Winston Churchill<a href=\"#footnote2-13-4367\" id=\"note2-13-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a><p class=\"p1\"><em>I have not failed 700 times. I’ve succeeded in proving 700 ways how not to build a lightbulb.</em> —Thomas Edison</p><p class=\"p1\">There&#8217;s no more reliable corollary than super-successful people thinking failure is fucking <em>awesome</em>.</p><p class=\"p1\">But there&#8217;s something to that. The science approach is all about learning through testing hypotheses, and hypotheses are built to be disproven, which means that scientists learn through failure. Failure is a critical part of their process.</p><p class=\"p1\">It makes sense. If there were two scientists trying to come up with a breakthrough in cancer treatment, and the first one is trying every bold thing he can imagine, failing left and right and learning something each time, while the second one is determined not to have any failures so is making sure his experiments are similar to others that have already been proven to work—which scientist would you bet on?</p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s not surprising that so many of the most wildly impactful people seem to treat the world like a lab and their life like an experiment session—that&#8217;s the best way to succeed at something.</p><p class=\"p1\">But for most of us, we just can&#8217;t do it. Even poor Self-Loathing Cook, who is so damn close to being a chef—but somehow so far away.</p><p>So what&#8217;s stopping him? I think two major misconceptions:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Misconception 1: Misplaced Fear</strong></span></p><p>We talked about the chef&#8217;s courage actually just being an accurate assessment of risk—and that&#8217;s one of the major things Self-Loathing Cook is missing. He thinks he has become wise to the farce of letting dogma dictate your life, but he&#8217;s actually in the grasp of dogma&#8217;s slickest trick.</p><p>Humans are programmed to take fear <em>very </em>seriously, and evolution didn&#8217;t find it efficient to have us assess and re-assess every fear inside of us. It went instead with the &#8220;better safe than sorry&#8221; philosophy—i.e. if there&#8217;s a chance that a certain fear might be based on real danger, file it away as a real fear, just in case, and even if you confirm later that a fear of yours has no basis, keep it with you, just in case. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>And the fear file cabinet is somewhere <em>way </em>down in our psyches—somewhere far below our centers of rationality, out of reach.</p><p>The purpose of all of that fear is to make us protect ourselves from danger. The problem for us is that as far as evolution is concerned, danger = something that hurts the chance that your genes will move on—i.e., danger = not mating or dying or your kids dying, and that&#8217;s about it.</p><p>So in the same way our cook-like qualities were custom-built for survival in tribal times, our obsession with fears of all shapes and sizes may have served us well in Ethiopia 50,000 years ago—but it mostly ruins our lives today.</p><p>Because not only does it amp up our fear in general to &#8220;shit we botched the hunt now the babies are all going to starve to death this winter&#8221; levels even though we live in an &#8220;oh no I got laid off now I have to sleep at my parents&#8217; house for two months with a feather pillow in ideal 68º temperature&#8221; world—but it also programs us to be terrified of all the wrong things. We&#8217;re more afraid of public speaking than texting on the highway, more afraid of approaching an attractive stranger in a bar than marrying the wrong person, more afraid of not being able to afford the same lifestyle as our friends than spending 50 years in meaningless career—all because embarrassment, rejection, and not fitting in really sucked for hunters and gatherers.</p><p>This leaves most of us with a skewed danger scale:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Danger-Scale.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4467 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Danger-Scale.png\" alt=\"Danger Scale\" width=\"501\" height=\"255\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Chefs hate real risk just as much as cooks—a chef that ends up in the Actually Dangerous territory and ends up in jail or in a gutter or in dire financial straits isn&#8217;t a chef—he&#8217;s a cook living under &#8220;I&#8217;m invincible&#8221; dogma. When we see chefs displaying what looks like incredible courage, they&#8217;re usually just in the Chef Lab. The Chef Lab is where all the action is and where the path to many people&#8217;s dreams lies—dreams about their career, about love, about adventure. But even though its doors are always open, most people never set foot in it for the same reason so many Americans never visit some of the world&#8217;s most interesting countries—because of an incorrect assumption that it&#8217;s a dangerous place. By reasoning by analogy when it comes to what constitutes danger and ending up with a misconception, Self-Loathing Cook is missing out on all the fun.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Misconception 2: Misplaced Identity</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">The second major problem for Self-Loathing Cook is that, like all cooks, he can&#8217;t wrap his head around the fact that he&#8217;s the scientist in the lab—not the experiment.</p><p class=\"p1\">As we established earlier, conscious tribe members reach conclusions, while blind tribe members <em>are </em>conclusions. And what you believe, what you stand for, and what you choose to do each day are conclusions that you&#8217;ve drawn. In some cases, very, very publicly.</p><p class=\"p1\">As far as society is concerned, when you give something a try—on the values front, the fashion front, the religious front, the career front—you&#8217;ve branded yourself. And since people like to simplify people in order to make sense of things in their own head, the tribe around you reinforces your brand by putting you in a clearly-labeled, oversimplified box.</p><p class=\"p1\">What this all amounts to is that it becomes very painful to <em>change</em>. Changing is <em>icky </em>for someone whose identity will have to change along with it. And others don&#8217;t make things any easier. Blind tribe members don&#8217;t like when other tribe members change—it confuses them, it forces them to readjust the info in their heads, and it threatens the simplicity of their tribal certainty. So attempts to evolve are often met with opposition or mockery or anger.</p><p class=\"p1\">And when you have a hard time changing, you become attached to who you currently are and what you&#8217;re currently doing—so attached that it blurs the distinction between the scientist and the experiment and you forget that they&#8217;re two different things.</p><p class=\"p1\">We talked about why scientists welcome negative feedback about their experiments. But when you <em>are</em> the experiment, negative feedback isn&#8217;t a piece of new, helpful information—it&#8217;s an <em>insult</em>. And it <em>hurts</em>. And it makes you <em>mad</em>.<em> </em>And because changing feels impossible, there&#8217;s not much good that feedback can do anyway—it&#8217;s like giving parents negative feedback on the name of their one-month-old child.</p><p class=\"p1\">We discussed why scientists expect plenty of their experiments to fail. But when you and the experiment are one and the same, not only is taking on a new goal a change of identity, it&#8217;s putting your identity on the <em>line</em>. If the experiment fails, <em>you</em><em> </em>fail. You <em>are</em><em> </em>a failure. Devastating. Forever.</p><p class=\"p1\">I talked to Musk about the United States and the way the forefathers reasoned by first principles when they started the country. He said he thought the reason they could do so is that they had a fresh slate to work with. The European countries of that era would have had a much harder time trying to do something like that—because, as he told me, they were &#8220;trapped in their own history.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;ve heard Musk use this same phrase to describe the big auto and aerospace companies of today. He sees Tesla and SpaceX like the late 18th century USA—fresh new labs ready for experiments—but when he looks at other companies in their industries, he sees an inability to drive their strategies from a clean slate mentality. Referring to the aerospace industry, Musk said, <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“There’s a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering.” </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Being trapped in your history means you don&#8217;t know how to change, you&#8217;ve forgotten how to innovate, and you&#8217;re stuck in the identity box the world has put you in. And you end up being the cancer researcher we mentioned who only tries likely-to-succeed experimentation within the comfort zone he knows best. </span></p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s for this reason that Steve Jobs looks back on his firing from Apple in 1986 as a blessing in disguise. He said:<a href=\"#footnote2-14-4367\" id=\"note2-14-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a> &#8220;Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.&#8221; Being fired &#8220;freed&#8221; Jobs from the shackles of his own history.</p><p class=\"p1\">So what Self-Loathing Cook has to ask himself is: &#8220;Am I trapped in my own history?&#8221; As he stands on the cliff with his wings ready for action and finds himself paralyzed—from evolving as a person, from making changes in his life, from trying to do something bold or unusual—is the baggage of his own identity part of what&#8217;s holding him back?</p><p class=\"p1\">Self-Loathing Cook&#8217;s beliefs about what&#8217;s scary aren&#8217;t any more real than Insecure Cook&#8217;s assumption that conventional wisdom has all the answers—but unlike the &#8220;Other people don&#8217;t know shit&#8221; epiphany, which you can observe evidence of all over the place, the epiphany that neither failing nor changing is actually a big deal can only be observed by experiencing it for yourself. Which you can only do after you overcome those fears&#8230;which only happens if you experience changing and failing and realize that nothing bad happens. Another catch-22.</p><p class=\"p1\">These are the reasons I believe so many of the world&#8217;s most able people are stuck in life as Self-Loathing Cook, one epiphany short of the promised land.</p><p class=\"p1\">The challenge with this last epiphany is to somehow figure out a way to lose respect for your own <em>fear</em>. That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by <em>defying </em>it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you&#8217;ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act. Doing something out of your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience, one that changes you—and each time you have that kind of experience, it chips away at your respect for your brain&#8217;s ingrained, irrational fears.</p><p class=\"p1\">Because the most important thing the chef knows that the cooks don&#8217;t is that real life and Grand Theft Auto aren&#8217;t actually that different. Grand Theft Auto is a fun video game because it&#8217;s a fake world where you can do things with no fear. Drive 200mph on the highway. Break into a building. Run over a prostitute with your car. All good in GTA.</p><p class=\"p1\">Unlike GTA, in real life, the law is a thing and jail is a thing. But that&#8217;s about where the differences end. If someone gave you a perfect simulation of today&#8217;s world to play in and told you that it&#8217;s all fake with no actual consequences—with the only rules being that you can&#8217;t break the law or harm anyone, and you still have to make sure to support your and your family&#8217;s basic needs—what would you do? My guess is that most people would do all kinds of things they&#8217;d love to do in their real life but wouldn&#8217;t dare to try, and that by behaving that way, they&#8217;d end up quickly getting a life going in the simulation that&#8217;s both far more successful and much truer to themselves than the real life they&#8217;re currently living. Removing the fear and the concern with identity or the opinions of others would thrust the person into the not-actually-risky Chef Lab and have them bouncing around all the exhilarating places outside their comfort zone—and their lives would take off. That&#8217;s the life irrational fears block us from.</p><p class=\"p1\">When I look at the amazing chefs of our time, what&#8217;s clear is that they&#8217;re more or less treating real life as if it&#8217;s Grand Theft Life. And doing so gives them superpowers. That&#8217;s what I think Steve Jobs meant all the times he said, &#8220;Stay hungry. Stay foolish.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">And that&#8217;s what this third epiphany is about: fearlessness.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\">So if we want to think like a scientist more often in life, those are the three key objectives—to be humbler about what we know, more confident about what&#8217;s possible, and less afraid of things that don&#8217;t matter.</p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s a good plan—but also, ugh. Right? That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to try to do.</p><p class=\"p1\">Usually at the end of a post like this, the major point seems manageable and concrete, and I finish writing it all excited to go be good at shit. But this post was like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s everything important and go do it.&#8221; So how do we work with that?</p><p class=\"p1\">I think the key is to not try to be a perfect chef or expect that of yourself whatsoever. Because no one&#8217;s a perfect chef—not even Elon. And no one&#8217;s a pure cook either—nothing&#8217;s black and white when you&#8217;re talking about an animal species whose brains contain 86 billion neurons. The reality is that we&#8217;re all a little of both, and where we are on that spectrum varies in 100 ways, depending on the part of life in question, the stage we&#8217;re in of our evolution, and our mood that day.</p><p class=\"p1\">If we want to improve ourselves and move our way closer to the chef side of the spectrum, we have to remember to remember. We have to remember that we have software, not just hardware. We have to remember that reasoning is a skill and like any skill, you get better at it if you work on it. And we have to remember the cook/chef distinction, so we can notice when we&#8217;re being like one or the other.</p><p>It&#8217;s fitting that this blog is called Wait But Why because the whole thing is a little like the grown-up version of the Why? game. After emerging from the blur of the arrogance of my early twenties, I began to realize that my software was full of a lot of unfounded certainty and blind assumptions and that I needed to spend some serious time <em>deconstructing—</em>which is the reason that every Wait But Why post, no matter what the topic, tends to start off with the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s really going on here?&#8221;</p><p>For me, that question is the springboard into all of this remembering to remember—it&#8217;s a hammer that shatters a brittle, protective feeling of certainty and forces me to do the hard work of building a more authentic, more useful set of thoughts about something. Or at least a better-embraced bewilderment.</p><p>And when I started learning about Musk in preparation to write these posts, it hit me that he wasn&#8217;t just doing awesome things in the world—he was a master at looking at the world, asking &#8220;What&#8217;s really going on here?&#8221; and seeing the real answer. That&#8217;s why his story resonated so hard with me and why I dedicated so much Wait But Why time to this series.</p><p>But also, Mars.

When I started, I never intended for it to become such an ordeal. But like the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla post</a>, I decided as I researched that this was A) a supremely important topic that will only become more important in the years to come, and B) something most people don&#8217;t know nearly enough about. My weeks of research and discussions with Musk and others built me an in-depth, tree-trunk understanding of what&#8217;s happening in what I&#8217;m calling The Story of Humans and Space—one that has totally reframed my mental picture of the future (yet again). And as I planned out what to include in the post, I wanted to make sure every Wait But Why reader ended up with the same foundation moving forward—because with everything that&#8217;s coming, we&#8217;re gonna need it. So like the Tesla post, this post became a full situation. Even the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/07/the-spacex-post-progress-meter.html\" target=\"_blank\">progress updates</a> leading up to its publication became a full situation.</p><p>Thanks for your patience.

All those things she had always heard about—buildings that were constructed hundreds of years before the first human set foot on Ganymede; animals the size of a house; oceans the size of her whole world; tropical beaches; the famous blue sky; the giant sun that&#8217;s so close it can burn your skin; and the weirdest part—<em>no Jupiter hovering overhead</em>. Having seen it all in so many movies, she felt like she was going to visit a legendary movie set. It was too much to think about all at once. For now, she just had to focus on making sure she had everything she needed and saying goodbye to everyone—it would be a long time before she would see them again&#8230;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a>Part 1: The Story of Humans and Space</strong></span></p><p>About six million years ago, a very important female great ape had two children. One of her children would go on to become the common ancestor of all chimpanzees. The other would give birth to a line that would one day include the entire human race. While the descendants of her first child would end up being pretty normal and monkey-ish, as time passed, strange things began to happen with the lineage of the other.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3902\" id=\"note-1-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3902\" id=\"note2-1-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> <strong><sup><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">←</span> click these</sup></strong></p><p>We&#8217;re not quite sure why, but over the next six million years, our ancestral line started to do something no creatures on Earth had ever done before—they woke up.</p><p>It happened slowly and gradually through the thousands of generations the same way your brain slowly comes to in the first few seconds after you rouse from sleep. But as the clarity increased, our ancestors started to look around and, for the very first time, <em>wonder</em>.</p><p>Emerging from a 3.6-billion-year dream, life on Earth had its first questions.</p><p><em>What is this big room we&#8217;re in, and who put us here?

Where are all the dead people now that they&#8217;re not here anymore? </em></p><p>We had discovered our species&#8217; great mystery novel—<em>Where Are We?</em>—and we wanted to learn how to read it.</p><p>As the light of human consciousness grew brighter and brighter, we began to arrive at answers that seemed to make sense. Maybe we were on top of a floating disk, and maybe that disk was on top of a huge turtle. Maybe the pinpricks of light above us at night are a glimpse into what lies beyond this big room—and maybe that&#8217;s where we go when we die. Maybe if we can find the place where the ceiling meets the floor, we can poke our heads through and see all the super fun stuff on the other side.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3902\" id=\"note2-2-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flammarion1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4088\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flammarion1.jpg\" alt=\"Flammarion\" width=\"527\" height=\"439\" /></a></p><p>Around 10,000 years ago, isolated tribes of humans began to merge together and form the first cities. In larger communities, people were able to talk to each other about this mystery novel we had found, comparing notes across tribes and through the generations. As the techniques for learning became more sophisticated and the clues piled up, new discoveries surfaced.</p><p>The world was apparently a ball, not a disk. Which meant that the ceiling was actually a larger sphere surrounding us. The sizes of the other objects floating out there in the sphere with us, and the distances between them, were vaster than we had ever imagined. And then, something upsetting:</p><p>The sun wasn&#8217;t revolving around us. We were revolving around the sun.</p><p>This was a <em>super </em>unwarm, unfuzzy discovery. Why the <em>hell</em> weren&#8217;t we in the center of things? What did that mean?</p><p><em>Where are we?</em></p><p>The sphere was already unpleasantly big—if we weren&#8217;t in the center of it, were we just on a random ball inside of it, kind of for no apparent reason? Could this really be what was happening?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Earth.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4163\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Earth.png\" alt=\"Tiny Earth\" width=\"629\" height=\"362\" /></a></p><p>Scary.</p><p>Then things got worse.</p><p>It seemed that the pinpricks of light on the edge of the sphere weren&#8217;t what we thought they were—they were other suns like ours. And they were out there floating just like our sun—which means <em>we weren&#8217;t inside of a sphere at all</em>. Not only was our planet not the center of things, even our <em>sun </em>was just a random dude out there, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothingness.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Sun.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4164\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Sun.png\" alt=\"Tiny Sun\" width=\"650\" height=\"374\" /></a></p><p><em>Scary.</em></p><p>Our sun turned out to be a little piece of something much bigger.

We were deciphering the pages of <em>Where Are We?</em> at our own peril, and we had deciphered our way right into the knowledge that we&#8217;re unbelievably alone, living on a lonely island inside a lonely island inside a lonely island, buried in layers of isolation, with no one to talk to.</p><p>That&#8217;s our situation.</p><p>In the most recent 1% of our species&#8217; short existence, we have become the first life on Earth to know about the Situation—and we&#8217;ve been having a collective existential crisis ever since.</p><p>You really can&#8217;t blame us. Imagine not realizing that the universe is a thing and <em>then realizing the universe is a thing</em>. It&#8217;s a <em>lot </em>to take in.</p><p>Most of us handle it by living in a pleasant delusion, pretending that the only place we live is in an endless land of colors and warmth.

The possibility of people leaving our Earth island and <em>venturing out</em><em>into space</em> burst open the human spirit of adventure.</p><p>I imagine a similar feeling in the people of the 15th century, during the Age of Discovery, when we were working our way through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg\" target=\"_blank\">world map chapter</a> of <em>Where Are We?</em> and the notion of cross-ocean voyages dazzled people&#8217;s imaginations. If you asked a child in 1495 what they wanted to be when they grew up, &#8220;an ocean explorer&#8221; would probably have been a common response.</p><p>In 1970, if you asked a child the same question, the answer would be, &#8220;an astronaut&#8221;—i.e. <em>a Situation explorer</em>.</p><p>WWII advanced the possibility of human space travel, but it was in late 1957, when the Soviets launched the first man-made object into orbit, the adorable <a href=\"http://www.bisbos.com/images_spacecraft/sputnik_1_800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Sputnik 1</a>, that space travel became <em>the </em>defining quest of the world&#8217;s great powers.</p><p>At the time, the Cold War was in full throttle, and the US and Soviets had their measuring sticks out for an internationally-televised penis-measuring contest. With the successful launch of Sputnik, the Soviet penis bolted out by a few centimeters, horrifying the Americans.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4126\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest1.png\" alt=\"Contest1\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" /></a></p><p>To the Soviets, putting a satellite into space before the US was proof that Soviet technology was superior to American technology, which in turn was put forward as proof, for all the world to see, that communism was a system superior to capitalism.</p><p>Eight months later, NASA was born.</p><p>The Space Race had begun, and NASA&#8217;s first order of business would be to get a man into space, and then a man into full orbit, preferably both before the Soviets. The US was not to be shown up again.</p><p>In 1959, NASA launched Project Mercury to carry out the mission. They were on the verge of success when in April of 1961, the Soviets launched Yuri Gagarin into a full orbit around the Earth, making the first human in space <em>and</em> in orbit a Soviet.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4127\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest2.png\" alt=\"Contest2\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" /></a></p><p>It was time for drastic measures. John F. Kennedy&#8217;s advisors <a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told him</a> that the Soviets had too big a lead for the US to beat them at any near-term achievements—but that the prospect of a manned <em>moon</em> landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to get <em>there</em> first. So Kennedy gave his famous &#8220;we choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hahhd&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m32s\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a>, and directed an outrageous amount of funding at the mission ($20 billion, or $205 billion in today&#8217;s dollars).</p><p>The result was Project Apollo. Apollo&#8217;s mission was to land an American on the moon—and to do it <em>first</em>. The Soviets answered with Soyuz, their own moon program, and the race was on.</p><p>As the early phases of Apollo started coming together, Project Mercury finally hit its stride. Just a month after Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, American astronaut Alan Shepard became the second man in space, completing a <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Freedom_7_Diagram.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">little arc</a> that didn&#8217;t put him in full orbit but allowed him to give space a high-five at the top of the arc. A few months later, in February of 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.</p><p>The next seven years saw 22 US and Soviet manned launches as the superpowers honed their skills and technology. By late 1968, the furiously-sprinting US had more total launches under their belt (17) than the Soviets (10), and together, the two nations had mastered what we call Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LEO.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4115\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LEO.jpg\" alt=\"LEO\" width=\"653\" height=\"516\" /></a></p><p>But LEO hadn&#8217;t really excited anyone since the early &#8217;60s. Both powers had their sights firmly set on the moon. The Apollo program was making quick leaps, and in December of 1968, the US became the first nation to soar outside of LEO. Apollo 8 made it all the way to the moon&#8217;s orbit and circled around 10 times before returning home safely. The crew, which included James Lovell (who a few months later played the role of Tom Hanks on the Apollo 13 mission), shattered the human altitude record and became the first people to see the moon up close, the first to see the &#8220;dark&#8221; side of the moon, and the first to see the Earth as a whole planet, snapping this iconic photo:<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3902\" id=\"note2-4-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3919 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg\" alt=\"1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\" /></a></p><p>Upon return, the crew became America&#8217;s most celebrated heroes—which I hope they enjoyed for eight months. Three Apollo missions later, in July of 1969, Apollo 11 made Americans Neil Armstrong<a href=\"#footnote-3-3902\" id=\"note-3-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> and Buzz Aldrin the first humans on the moon, and Armstrong took this famous photo of Aldrin looking all puffy:<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3902\" id=\"note2-5-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3920\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg\" alt=\"Aldrin_Apollo_11\" width=\"356\" height=\"356\" /></a></p><p>It&#8217;s hard to fully emphasize what a big deal this was. Ever since life on Earth began 3.6 billion years ago, no earthly creature had set foot on any celestial body other than the Earth. Suddenly, there are Armstrong and Aldrin, bouncing around <em>another </em>sphere, looking up in the sky where the moon is supposed to be and seeing the Earth instead. Insane.</p><p>Project Apollo proved to be a smashing success. Not only did Apollo get a man on the moon before the Soviets, the program sent 10 more men to the moon over the next 3.5 years on five other Apollo missions. There were six successful moon trips in seven tries, with the famous exception being Apollo 13, which was safely aborted after an explosion in the oxygen tank.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3902\" id=\"note-4-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p>The Soviet Soyuz program kept running into technical problems, and it never ended up putting someone on the moon.</p><p>The final Apollo moonwalk took place in late 1972. In only one decade, we had conquered nearby space, and progress was accelerating. If at that time you had asked any American, or any other human, what the coming decades of space travel would bring, they&#8217;d have made big, bold predictions. Many more people on the moon, a permanent moon base, people on Mars, and beyond.</p><p>So you can only imagine how surprised they&#8217;d be if you told them in 1972, after just watching 12 humans walk on the moon, that 43 years later, in the impossibly futuristic-sounding year 2015, the number of people to set foot on the moon <em>would still be 12</em>. Or that after leaving Low Earth Orbit in the dust years earlier and using it now as our pre-moon trip parking lot, 2015 would roll around and LEO would be the farthest out humans would ever go.</p><p>1972 people would be blown away by our smart phones and our internet, but they&#8217;d be just as shocked that we gave up on pushing our boundaries in space.</p><p>So what happened? After such a wildly exciting decade of human space adventure, why did we just <em>stop?</em></p><p>Well, like we found in the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla post</a>, &#8220;Why did we stop?&#8221; is the wrong question. Instead, we should ask:</p><p><em>Why were we ever adventurous about sending humans into space in the first place?</em></p><p>Space travel is unbelievably expensive. National budgets are incredibly tight. The fact is, it&#8217;s kind of surprising that a nation <em>ever</em> ponied up a sizable chunk of its budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries.</p><p>And that&#8217;s actually because no nation <em>did </em>blow their budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries—two nations blew their budgets because of a <em>penis</em>&#8211;<em>length</em> contest. In the face of international embarrassment at a time when everyone was trying to figure out whose economic system was better, the US government agreed to drop the usual rules for a few years to pour whatever resources were necessary on the problem to make sure they won that argument—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Early-budget.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4129\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Early-budget.png\" alt=\"Early budget\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" /></a></p><p>And once they won it, the contest was over and so were the special rules. And the US went back to spending money like a normal person.<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3902\" id=\"note2-6-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Full-budget.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4133\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Full-budget.png\" alt=\"Full budget\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" /></a></p><p>Instead of continuing to push the limits at all costs, the US and the Soviets got a grip, put their pants back on, shook hands, and started working together like adults on far more practical projects, like setting up a joint space station in LEO.</p><p>In the four decades since then, the Story of Humans and Space has again become confined to Earth, where we find ourselves with two primary reasons to interact with space (Note: the next whole chunk of the post is a slight diversion for an overview on satellites, space probes, and space telescopes.

It&#8217;s about using space for practical purposes in support of industries on Earth—mostly in the form of satellites. The bulk of today&#8217;s rocket launches into space are simply putting things into LEO whose purpose is to look back down at Earth, not to the great expanses in the other direction.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a little satellite overview:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Satellites Blue Box</strong></span></p><p>We don&#8217;t think about them that often, but above us are hundreds of flying robots that play a large part in our lives on Earth. In 1957, lonely Sputnik circled the Earth by itself, but today, the worlds of communication, weather forecasting, television, navigation, and aerial photography all rely heavily on satellites, as do many national militaries and government intelligence agencies.</p><p>The total market for satellite manufacturing, the launches that carry them to space, and related equipment and services has ballooned from $60 billion in 2004 to over $200 billion in 2015. Satellite industry revenue today makes up only 4% of the global telecommunications industry but accounts for over 60% of space industry revenue.<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3902\" id=\"note2-7-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Here&#8217;s how the world&#8217;s satellites break down by role (in 2013):<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3902\" id=\"note2-8-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SatFunction1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3928\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SatFunction1.png\" alt=\"SatFunction\" width=\"459\" height=\"417\" /></a></p><p>Of the 1,265 active satellites in orbit at the beginning of 2015, the US owns by far <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/264472/number-of-satellites-in-orbit-by-operating-country/\" target=\"_blank\">the largest number</a> at 528—over 40% of the total—but over 50 countries own at least one orbiting satellite.</p><p>As for <em>where </em>all of these satellites are, most of them fall into two distinct &#8220;layers&#8221; of space:</p><p>About two-thirds of active satellites are in Low Earth Orbit. LEO starts up at 99 miles (160 km) above the Earth, the lowest altitude at which an object can orbit without atmospheric drag messing things up.  The top of LEO is 1,240 miles (2,000 km) up. Typically, the lowest satellites are at around 220 miles (350 km) up or higher.</p><p>Most of the rest (about one-third) of the satellites are much farther out, in a place called geostationary orbit (GEO). It&#8217;s right at 22,236 miles (35,786 km) above the Earth, and it&#8217;s called geostationary because something orbiting in it rotates at the exact speed that the Earth turns, making its position in the sky stationary relative to a point on the Earth. It&#8217;ll seem to be motionless to an observer on the ground.<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3902\" id=\"note2-9-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geostationaryjava3D.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3924 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geostationaryjava3D.gif\" alt=\"Geostationaryjava3D\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p>GEO is ideal for something like a TV satellite because a dish on the Earth can aim at the same fixed spot all the time.</p><p>A small percentage of other satellites are in medium Earth orbit (MEO), which is everything in between LEO and GEO. One notable resident of MEO is the GPS system that most Americans, and people from many other countries, use every day. I never realized that the entire GPS system, a US Department of Defense project that went live in 1995, only uses 32 satellites total. And until 2012, the number was only 24—six orbits, each with four satellites. But you can see in the GIF below that even with 24, a given point on the Earth can be seen by at least six of the satellites at any given time, and usually it&#8217;s nine or higher (in the GIF, the blue dot on the Earth is a hypothetical person on the ground, and whichever satellites can see him at a given time are blue, with the green lines showing their line of sight to the person):<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3902\" id=\"note2-10-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ConstellationGPS.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3925 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ConstellationGPS.gif\" alt=\"ConstellationGPS\" width=\"240\" height=\"192\" /></a></p><p>This is why your phone&#8217;s map can still show your location even when you&#8217;re somewhere with no cellular service—because it has nothing to do with cellular service. The system is also set up to be redundant—only four satellites need to simultaneously see you in order for the system to pinpoint your location. GPS satellites have an orbital period of about 12 hours, making two full rotations of the Earth each day.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3902\" id=\"note-5-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p>You can see satellite locations using <a href=\"http://www.gearthblog.com/satellites\" target=\"_blank\">Google Earth</a> (here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydbbd-4oEds\" target=\"_blank\">cool video</a> of Google Earth showing the satellites).</p><div class=\"wbwAside2\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><b>Space Debris Bluer Box</b></span></p><p>There&#8217;s a big problem happening in the world of satellites. In addition to the 1,265 active satellites up in orbit, there are thousands more inactive satellites, as well as a bunch of spent rockets from previous missions. And once in a while, one of them explodes, or two of them collide, creating a ton of tiny fragments called space debris. The number of objects in space has risen quickly over recent decades, as a GIF<a href=\"#footnote-6-3902\" id=\"note-6-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> made by the ESA shows (with exaggerated-sized objects relative to the Earth&#8217;s size):<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3902\" id=\"note2-11-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3931 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb.gif\" alt=\"2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb\" width=\"675\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>The majority of satellites and debris are bunched around the Earth in LEO, and the outer ring of objects is what&#8217;s located in GEO.</p><p>Earth space agencies track about 17,000 objects in space, only 7% of which are active satellites.

There are two high-tech ways modern astronomers see things:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Looking and Learning Tool #1: Sending probes around the Solar System</strong></span></p><p>Basically, scientists fire a fancy robot toward some distant planet, moon, or asteroid, and the robot spends months or years flying through space, bored, until it finally arrives. Then, depending on the plan, it either just flies by the object, taking some pictures on the way, orbits the object to get more detailed information, or lands on the object for a full inspection. Everything it learns, it sends back to us, and one day, when its job is done, we either kill the probe by crashing it into the object or let it just fly out into deep space to be depressed.</p><p>I often use myself as a litmus test for what the public probably knows about or doesn&#8217;t know about. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before on this blog, I&#8217;ve been seriously dating astronomy ever since I was three years old—so if I don&#8217;t know something going on in the world of space, I assume that most people don&#8217;t. And when it comes to space probes, I&#8217;ve felt pretty disoriented. Are there 200 of them flying around out there? 50? 9? Why are they out there, who sent them, and what are they doing? All I&#8217;d know is that sometimes there would be a random story about some probe sending back stunning pictures—I&#8217;d open the cnn.com gallery, click through them, be thrilled for a second, send the link to the three friends of mine who are also dating astronomy, and then try to close the page but instead see some trashy CNN clickbait headline on the side of the page, click that, and ruin my life for the next three hateful hours. That&#8217;s my relationship with humanity&#8217;s space probes.</p><p>But in researching this post, I quickly realized there&#8217;s not that much to know, and it doesn&#8217;t take too big an effort to get fully oriented.

It&#8217;s kind of like other labs, except with the party trick that it&#8217;s soaring through space, so it&#8217;s the one lab where you can test things in zero gravity (it&#8217;s not actually zero gravity—it&#8217;s <em>micro</em>gravity<em>—</em>something I&#8217;ll explain later in the post).</li></ul><ul><li>What most <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/casis_spacex4\" target=\"_blank\">ISS experiments</a> have in common is that they&#8217;re there for the gravity situation, but beyond that, they span a wide range of purposes—everything from learning about osteoporosis as astronauts&#8217; bones atrophy (because they don&#8217;t have to fight against gravity), to testing how equipment holds up in space, to analyzing how fluids behave and interact without the influence of any other forces, to using the change in gravity to trick bacteria into revealing which genes make them immune to certain medicines.</li></ul><ul><li>Astronauts in the ISS have a tight and controlled schedule during the week. At all times, they&#8217;re either sleeping (8.5 hours), eating (1.5 hours for breakfast/dinner, 1 hour for lunch) exercising (mandatory 2.5 hours a day), or working on experiments (9 hours a day)—I took <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7334s.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this photo</a> of the current schedule of the three astronauts on the ISS.<a href=\"#footnote-16-3902\" id=\"note-16-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> Weekends are off, which could not possibly sound more fun—you get to spend the whole time floating around and looking out the window.</li></ul><ul><li>I&#8217;m not the only one who badly wants to play on the ISS—there&#8217;s a furiously competitive process to be selected by NASA to go. Thousands apply, 100 are picked for a final round interview and physical examination, and only one or two end up getting the nod. On rare occasion, a private company or individual can buy a spot on the station for a few days, but it costs around $60 million.</li></ul><p>If you want to get a better feel for what it&#8217;s like to live on the ISS, here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doN4t5NKW-k\" target=\"_blank\">video tour</a> of the space station by a floaty astronaut.</p></div><p>So far, 216 people have gotten to play on the ISS, from 15 countries:<a href=\"#footnote2-30-3902\" id=\"note2-30-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">30</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iss_visitors_country.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4267\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iss_visitors_country.png\" alt=\"iss_visitors_country\" width=\"750\" height=\"357\" /></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">How Stuff Gets to Space</span><br /></strong></span></p><p>We&#8217;ve gone over what&#8217;s in space, but how does all that stuff <em>get </em>to space? Have you ever asked yourself how something like the GPS satellite gets up there in the first place? The answer is that there are nine countries that have the ability to launch something into orbit: Russia, the US, France, Japan, China, India, Israel, Iran and, um, North Korea—along with one non-national entity, the European Space Agency (ESA). If a satellite goes up into space, it&#8217;s because someone paid one of those ten entities to bring it there atop a massive, expensive rocket (or because a country is putting one up there for its own uses).</p><p>As for launching <em>humans </em>into space, only three countries in history have done it—Russia, the US, and China (who is a fast-growing newcomer to the space industry). Since the 60s, Russia has used its Soyuz rockets to launch people into space, and the US, after wrapping up the Apollo program in 1972, regained the ability to put people in orbit in 1981 with the Space Shuttle program.<a href=\"#footnote2-31-3902\" id=\"note2-31-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">31</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6938210-space-shuttle-photos.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3944\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6938210-space-shuttle-photos.jpg\" alt=\"SPACE-SHUTTLE/\" width=\"488\" height=\"305\" /></a></p><p>Over the next 30 years, the US launched 135 Space Shuttles into LEO, with 133 successes. The two exceptions are fairly traumatizing parts of American history—<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTrmJtHLFU\" target=\"_blank\">Challenger</a> </em>in 1986 and <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIJiW8d_c68\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia</a> </i>in 2003.</p><p>The Space Shuttle Program retired in 2011. Today, only two countries can launch a human into orbit—Russia and China. With no capability themselves, the US—the country that once triumphantly put a man on the moon while the world watched—now has to launch their astronauts on Russian rockets, at Russia&#8217;s whim.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>So what are we to make of The Story of Humans and Space? It&#8217;s a bit of an odd tale. In 1970, the story looked like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4136\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph1.png\" alt=\"graph1\" width=\"393\" height=\"295\" /></a></p><p>So the assumption about where the story was headed was this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4137\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph2.png\" alt=\"graph2\" width=\"390\" height=\"294\" /></a></p><p>But now it&#8217;s 2015, and it turns out that this is what was happening:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph3.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4138\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph3.png\" alt=\"graph3\" width=\"390\" height=\"275\" /></a></p><p>When I look at what&#8217;s going on with humans and space today, I should think it&#8217;s incredible. Just 58 years after the Soviets put the first man-made object into orbit, we now have a swarm of high-tech equipment soaring around our planet, giving humans magical capabilities in vision and communication. There&#8217;s a team of flying robot messengers spread out through the Solar System, reporting back to us with their findings. There&#8217;s a <em>huge flying telescope </em>high above Earth, showing us exactly what the observable universe looks like. There&#8217;s a football field-sized <i>science lab </i>250 miles above our heads with <em>people </em>in it.</p><p>Everything I just said is <em>amazing</em>.</p><p>And if only The Story of Humans and Space looked like this—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4139\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph4.png\" alt=\"graph4\" width=\"390\" height=\"275\" /></a></p><p>—I would be <em>marveling </em>at the things we&#8217;re currently doing out in The Situation.</p><p>But unfortunately, the 60s happened. So instead, it&#8217;s like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4143\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic1.png\" alt=\"magic1\" width=\"400\" height=\"342\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4116\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic2.jpg\" alt=\"magic2\" width=\"400\" height=\"350\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4117\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic3.jpg\" alt=\"magic3\" width=\"700\" height=\"174\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4118\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic4.jpg\" alt=\"magic4\" width=\"500\" height=\"313\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic5.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4144\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic5.png\" alt=\"magic5\" width=\"400\" height=\"329\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4119\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic6.jpg\" alt=\"magic6\" width=\"400\" height=\"359\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic7.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4145\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic7.png\" alt=\"magic7\" width=\"400\" height=\"359\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic8.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4146\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic8.png\" alt=\"magic8\" width=\"400\" height=\"264\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic8.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4146\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic8.png\" alt=\"magic8\" width=\"400\" height=\"264\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic9.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4147\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic9.png\" alt=\"magic9\" width=\"400\" height=\"402\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic10.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4148\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/magic10.png\" alt=\"magic10\" width=\"400\" height=\"328\" /></a></p><p>A good magic show follows a simple rule—make the act get better as it goes along. If you can&#8217;t continue to stay a step ahead of the increasingly-jaded crowd, they&#8217;ll quickly tune you out.</p><p>In some areas, the Humans and Space magic show has continued steadily upward. In our quest for knowledge and understanding, for example, we continue to outdo ourselves, learning significantly more about the universe every decade. The human spirit of <em>discovery </em>is alive and well, having thrived in space in the years since Apollo.</p><p>But as fascinated as we are by discovery—as much as we yearn to know all the secrets hidden in the pages of <em>Where Are We?—</em>when it comes to filling us with true excitement and inspiration and getting our <em>adrenaline </em>pumping, discovery doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to <em>adventure. </em>Probes and telescopes may fill us with wonder and light up our curiosity, but nothing gets us in our <em>animal core</em> like watching our species go <em>where no man has gone before. </em>And in that arena, the last four decades have left us feeling empty. After watching people land on the moon, following manned missions to and from the ISS is, as Ross Andersen <a href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, &#8220;about as thrilling as watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.&#8221;</p><p>And that&#8217;s why, in today&#8217;s world, The Story of Humans and Space has drifted off the front page of our consciousness. The topic that should drop all of us to our knees has become a geeky sideshow. Ask 10 well-educated people you know about what&#8217;s going on with Solar System probes or the ISS or NASA or SpaceX and most won&#8217;t be able to tell you very much. Some won&#8217;t even know that people ever go to space anymore. People don&#8217;t know because people don&#8217;t care. Because of the way it played out, The Story of Humans and Space feels like a disappointment. And looking at the world around us today, it&#8217;s intuitive to predict that future chapters of the space story will continue to putter along as they do today:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph52.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4271\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph52.png\" alt=\"graph5\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" /></a></p><p>Many people don&#8217;t think this is a bad thing. &#8220;Why spend exorbitant amounts of money sending people to the far reaches of space when we have so many problems right here on Earth?&#8221; they ask. Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, who spent three decades playing a key role in US budget decision-making, calls ambitious manned space travel &#8220;at best a luxury that the country ought not to be indulging in&#8221; and &#8220;a complete and total waste of money&#8221; and &#8220;pure boondoggle.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-32-3902\" id=\"note2-32-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a> And the dramatic slashes to NASA&#8217;s budget since the Space Race ended suggest that Frank isn&#8217;t the only US politician to hold this view.</p><p>Upon first assessment, Frank is being perfectly rational—after all, in the face of concerns like healthcare, national security, education, and poverty, should we really make room for an &#8220;adventure budget&#8221;? And in that light, the graph projection above for The Future of Humans and Space seems all the more likely to continue on its current course.</p><p>I&#8217;ve spent the last couple months reading, talking, and thinking almost non-stop about what the coming chapters of this story will look like—and my assumptions about the future have now changed dramatically.</p><p>I think we&#8217;re all in for a big surprise.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 28px;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/2\">Part 2: Musk&#8217;s Mission →</a></span></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>For those new to Wait But Why, blue circle footnotes (like this one) are good to click on—they&#8217;re for fun facts, extra thoughts, extraneous quotes from my conversations with Musk, and further explanation.<a href=\"#note-1-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-2-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>It was actually the Germans who had the world&#8217;s early lead in rocket technology, but when they lost the war, the Americans, Soviets, and British pillaged Germany&#8217;s rocket engineers, with each successfully recruiting a number of them.

If it were alone out there, that would be one thing, but if none of the huge dwarf planets in the asteroid or Kuiper belts were planets (including Pluto&#8217;s newly-discovered and almost-as-large neighbor, Eris), then there was no good reason Pluto should randomly be one. So the dramatically nerdy International Astronomical Union got together and, amidst tantrums on both sides, settled on an official definition for a planet: 1) Had to orbit the sun, 2) Had to be big enough to become spherical-ish under its own gravity, 3) Had to have cleared out its own orbit. Pluto failed on #3, since there are many other objects in its orbit, which is part of the Kuiper belt. One other fun fact while we&#8217;re here: after Uranus was discovered and named, chemists soon after named a newly-invented element after it—uranium. They did the same thing with neptunian (apparently there&#8217;s a neptunium) after Neptune was named, and the newly-named Pluto turned into the naming of the element plutonium.<a href=\"#note-9-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-10-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>An AU is an &#8220;astronomical unit&#8221;—the distance from the Earth to the sun—which is about 93 million miles (150 million km).<a href=\"#note-10-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-11-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>To get a feel for the size of Ceres and Vesta, <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/4_Vesta_1_Ceres_Moon_at_20_km_per_px.png\" target=\"_blank\">here&#8217;s</a> what they&#8217;d look like next to our moon.<a href=\"#note-11-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-12-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Awkwardly, after almost 20 years of battling for a Hubble budget and creating the telescope, and after finally having launched a risky and difficult Space Shuttle mission to put it into orbit, NASA received the first Hubble photos, only to find that they were <em>blurry.</em> Turns out the mirror curvature was off by 2.2 thousandth of a millimeter. An almost imperceptible error, but with the vast distances the telescope needed to take in, it was enough to ruin everything. It wasn&#8217;t until almost four years later that another Space Shuttle mission was able to get back to the telescope to make a fix. The fix had to be worked out perfectly on Earth first, and the astronauts had to implement it perfectly in space—the mirror shape is so precise that if an astronaut even brushed up against it by accident during the repair process, it would ruin it.

") (content:encoded nil "<p>I woke up this morning to a text from Andrew. It was a link:</p><p><a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/\" target=\"_blank\">http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/</a></p><p>&#8220;optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late&#8221;</p><p>Intriguing. Nothing&#8217;s better than the headline, &#8220;The reason people are [bad quality that describes you] is actually because they&#8217;re [good quality].&#8221;</p><p>I got reading. And as it turns out, late people are actually the best people ever.<em> </em>They&#8217;re optimistic and hopeful:</p><p><em>&#8220;People who are continuously late are actually just more optimistic. They believe they can fit more tasks into a limited amount of time more than other people and thrive when they’re multitasking. Simply put, they’re fundamentally hopeful.&#8221;</em></p><p>They&#8217;re big-thinking:</p><p><em>&#8220;People who are habitually late don’t sweat over the small stuff, they concentrate on the big picture and see the future as full of infinite possibilities.&#8221;</em></p><p>Late people just <em>get </em>it:</p><p><em>&#8220;People with a tendency for tardiness like to stop and smell the roses&#8230;l</em><em>ife was never meant to be planned down to the last detail. Remaining excessively attached to timetables signifies an inability to enjoy the moment.&#8221;</em></p><p>By the end of the article, I had never felt prouder to be a chronically late person.</p><p>But also, what the hell is going on? Late people are the <em>worst</em>. It&#8217;s the quality I like <em>least </em>in myself. And I&#8217;m not late because I like to smell the roses, or because I can see the big picture, or because the future is full of infinite possibilities.</p><p>I&#8217;m late because I&#8217;m insane.</p><p>So I thought about this for a minute, and I think I figured out what&#8217;s going on. The issue is that there are two kinds of lateness:</p><p><strong>1) Okay lateness.</strong> This is when the late person being late does not negatively impact anyone else—like being late to a group hangout or a party. Things can start on time and proceed as normal with or without the late person being there yet.</p><p><strong>2) Not okay lateness. </strong>This is when the late person being late <em>does</em> negatively impact others—like being late to a two-person dinner or meeting or anything else that simply can&#8217;t start until the late party arrives.</p><p>Haltiwanger&#8217;s article is (I hope) talking mostly about <em>okay </em>lateness. In which case sure, maybe those people are the best, who knows.</p><p>But if you read the comment section under Haltiwanger&#8217;s article, people are <em>furious</em> with him for portraying lateness in a positive light. And that&#8217;s because <em>they&#8217;re </em>thinking about the far less excusable <em>not </em>okay lateness.</p><p>All of this has kind of left me with no choice but to take a quick nine-hour break from working on the gargantuan SpaceX post to discuss <em>not </em>okay late people.</p><p>When it comes to people who are chronically not okay late, I think there are two subgroups:</p><p><strong>Group 1) Those who don&#8217;t feel bad or wrong about it. </strong>These people are assholes.</p><p><strong>Group 2) Those who feel terrible and self-loathing about it. </strong>These people have problems.</p><p>Group 1 is simple. They think they&#8217;re a little more special than everyone else, like the zero-remorse narcissist <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/\" target=\"_blank\">at the top</a> of Haltiwanger&#8217;s article. They&#8217;re unappealing. Not much else to discuss here.</p><p>Punctual people think <em>all </em>not okay late people are in Group 1 (as the comments on this post will show)—because they&#8217;re assuming all late people are sane people.</p><p>When a sane person thinks a certain kind of behavior is fine, they do it. When they think it&#8217;s wrong, they don&#8217;t do it. So to a punctual person—one who shows up on time because they believe showing up late is the wrong thing to do—someone who&#8217;s chronically late must be an asshole who thinks being late is okay.</p><p>But that&#8217;s misunderstanding the entire second group, who, despite being consistently late, usually detest the concept of making other people wait. Let call them CLIPs (Chronically Late Insane Person).</p><p>While both groups of not okay late people end up regularly frustrating others, a reliable way to identify a Group 2 CLIP is a bizarre compulsion to defeat themselves—some deep inner drive to inexplicably miss the beginning of movies, endure psychotic stress running to catch the train, crush their own reputation at work, etc. etc. As much as they may hurt others, they usually hurt themselves even more.</p><p>I come from a long line of CLIPs. I spent around 15% of my youth standing on some sidewalk alone, angrily kicking rocks, because yet <em>again</em>, all the other kids had gotten picked up and I was still waiting for my mom. When she finally arrived, instead of being able to have a pleasant conversation with her, I&#8217;d get into the car seething. She always felt terrible. She has problems.</p><p>My sister once missed an early morning flight, so they rescheduled her for the following morning. She managed to miss that one <em>too</em>, so they put her on a flight five hours later. Killing time during the long layover, she got distracted on a long phone call and <em>missed that flight too. </em>She has problems<em>. </em></p><p>I&#8217;ve been a CLIP my whole life. I&#8217;ve made a bunch of friends mad at me, I&#8217;ve embarrassed myself again and again in professional situations, and I&#8217;ve run a cumulative marathon through airport terminals. It&#8217;s often the same story, something like this:</p><p>I&#8217;ll be meeting someone, maybe a professional contact, at, say, a coffee place at 3:00. When I lay out my schedule for the day, I&#8217;ll have the perfect plan. I&#8217;ll leave early, arrive early, and get there around 2:45. That takes all the stress out of the situation, and that&#8217;s ideal because non-stressful commutes are one of my favorite things. It&#8217;ll be great—I&#8217;ll stroll out, put on a podcast, and head to the subway. Once I&#8217;m off the subway, with time to spare, I&#8217;ll take a few minutes to peruse storefronts, grab a lemonade from a street vendor, and <em>enjoy New York</em>. It&#8217;ll be such a joy to look up at the architecture, listen to the sounds, and feel the swell of people rushing by—oh magnificent city!</p><p>All I have to do is be off the subway by 2:45. To do that, I need to be on the subway by 2:25, so let&#8217;s be safe and get to the subway by 2:15. So I have to leave my apartment by 2:07 or earlier, and I&#8217;m set. What a plan. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;ll play out (if you&#8217;re new to WBW, you&#8217;re advised to <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">check this

I&#8217;m sure each CLIP is insane in their own special way, and to understand how they work, you&#8217;ll usually have to get to some dark inner psychology. For me, it&#8217;s some mix of these three odd traits:</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I&#8217;m late because I&#8217;m in denial about how time works.</span> </strong>The propensity of CLIPs to underestimate how long things take comes out of some habitual delusional optimism. Usually what happens is, of all the times the CLIP has done a certain activity or commute, what they remember is that one time things went the <em>quickest</em>. And <em>that </em>amount of time is what sticks in their head as how long that thing takes. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s <em>anything </em>that will get me to internalize that packing for a week-long trip takes 20 minutes. In my head, it&#8217;s eternally a five-minute task. You just take out the bag, throw some clothes in it, throw your toiletries in, zip it up and done. Five minutes. The empirical data that shows that there are actually a lot of little things to think about when you pack and that it takes 20 minutes every time is irrelevant. Packing is clearly a five-minute task. As I type this, that&#8217;s what I believe.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I&#8217;m late because I have a weird aversion to changing circumstances.</span> </strong>Not sure what the deal is with this, but something in me is strangely appalled by the idea of transitioning from what I&#8217;m currently doing to doing something else. When I&#8217;m at home working, I <em>hate </em>when there&#8217;s something on my schedule that I have to stop everything for to go outside and do. It&#8217;s not that I hate the activity—once I&#8217;m there I&#8217;m often pleased to be there—it&#8217;s an irrational resistance to the <em>transition</em>. The positive side of this is it usually means I&#8217;m highly present when I finally do haul my ass somewhere, and I&#8217;m often among the last to leave.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Finally, I&#8217;m late because I&#8217;m mad at myself. </strong></span>There&#8217;s a pretty strong correlation here—the worse I feel about my productivity so far that day, the more likely I am to be late. When I&#8217;m pleased with how I&#8217;ve lived the day so far, the Rational Decision-Maker has a much easier time taking control of the wheel. I feel like an adult, so it&#8217;s easy to act like an adult. But times when the monkey had his way with me all day, when the time rolls around that I need to stop working and head out somewhere, I can&#8217;t <em>believe</em> that this is <em>all</em> I&#8217;ve gotten done. So my brain throws a little tantrum, refusing to accept the regrettable circumstances, and stages a self-flagellating protest, saying, &#8220;NO. This can<em>not </em>be the situation. Nope. You didn&#8217;t do what you were supposed to do, and now you&#8217;ll sit here and get more done, even if it makes you late.&#8221;</p><p>So yeah, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m late—because I&#8217;m insane. Don&#8217;t excuse the CLIPs in your life—it&#8217;s not okay and they need to fix it—but remember, it&#8217;s not about you. They have problems.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>More Wait But Why discussions of human insanity:</strong></span></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think</a></span></strong></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html\" target=\"_blank\">Life is a Picture But You Live in a Pixel</a></span></strong></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/07/why-im-always-late.html\">Why I&#8217;m Always Late</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>

") (content:encoded nil "<p><i>This is Part 2 of a four-part series on Elon Musk&#8217;s companies. For an explanation of why this series is happening and how Musk is involved, </i><span class=\"s1\"><i><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">start with Part 1</a>.</i></span></p><p>A Wait But Why post can be a few different things. One type of WBW post is the &#8220;let&#8217;s just take this whole topic and really actually get to the bottom of it so we can all completely get it from here forward.&#8221; The ideal topic for that kind of post is one that&#8217;s really important to our lives, and that tends to come up a lot, but that&#8217;s also hugely complex and confusing, often controversial with differing information coming out of different mouths, and that ends up leaving a lot of people feeling like they don&#8217;t totally get it as well as they &#8220;should.&#8221;</p><p>The way I approach a post like that is I&#8217;ll start with the surface of the topic and ask myself what I don&#8217;t fully get—I look for those foggy spots in the story where when someone mentions it or it comes up in an article I&#8217;m reading, my mind kind of glazes over with a combination of &#8220;ugh it&#8217;s that icky term again nah go away&#8221; and &#8220;ew the adults are saying that adult thing again and I&#8217;m seven so I don&#8217;t actually understand what they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; Then I&#8217;ll get reading about those foggy spots—but as I clear away fog from the surface, I often find more fog underneath. So then I research that new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down. My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.</p><p>For example, I kind of got the Iraq situation, but there was a lot of fog there too—so when I wrote <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">a post</a> about it, one fog-clearing rabbit hole took me all the way back to Muhammad in 570AD. That was the floor. Digging into another part of the story brought me to the end of World War I. Another brought me to the founding of ISIS.</p><p>Hitting the floor is a great feeling and makes me realize that the adults weren&#8217;t actually saying anything that complicated or icky after all. And when I come across that topic again, it&#8217;s <em>fun </em>now, because I <em>get </em>it and I can nod with a serious face on and be like, &#8220;Yes, interest rates are problematic&#8221; like a real person.</p><p>I&#8217;ve heard people compare knowledge of a topic to a tree. If you don&#8217;t fully get it, it&#8217;s like a tree in your head with no trunk—and without a trunk, when you learn something new about the topic—a new branch or leaf of the tree—there&#8217;s nothing for it to hang onto, so it just falls away. By clearing out fog all the way to the bottom, I build a tree trunk in my head, and from then on, all new information can hold on, which makes that topic forever more interesting and productive to learn about. And what I usually find is that so many of the topics I&#8217;ve pegged as &#8220;boring&#8221; in my head are actually just foggy to me—like watching episode 17 of a great show, which would be boring if you didn&#8217;t have the tree trunk of the back story and characters in place.</p><p>So when it was time to start what I had labeled in my head as &#8220;the Tesla post,&#8221; I knew this was going to be one of those posts. To understand if and why Tesla Motors matters, you have to understand both the story of cars and the story of energy—two worlds I somehow am simultaneously confused by and tremendously sick of. Just hearing someone say &#8220;climate change&#8221; or &#8220;energy crisis&#8221; or &#8220;tailpipe emissions&#8221; makes me kind of gag at this point—just too much politics, too many annoying people, too much misinformation on all sides, and it&#8217;s just hard to know how much I actually care and if there can be a solution to all of it anyway. So I did what I do when my tortoise shits when I&#8217;m out of the apartment and then spends hours walking through it and tracking it across everything, including the walls somehow—I rolled up my sleeves, took a deep breath, whispered, &#8220;Be a man, Tim,&#8221; and started scraping through layers of shit. If I have to live in a world with people arguing constantly about energy and oil and greenhouse gases and incentive programs, I might as well build myself a proper tree trunk.</p><p>After weeks of reading and asking questions and writing, I&#8217;ve emerged from the tortoise sewage with something that toes the line between a long blog post and a short book. I could have broken this into multiple posts, but it&#8217;s all one story and I wanted to keep it all together. It&#8217;ll be a bit of a time investment, but I think you&#8217;ll come out of it with a sturdier tree trunk about all of this than you have now. And as it turns out, when it comes to this topic, we may be witnessing a very awesome moment in history without quite realizing it yet.</p><p>Two disclaimers before we start:</p><p>1) This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political agenda. I&#8217;m not political because nothing could <em>ever possibly be more annoying </em>than American politics. I think both parties have good points, both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things, and I want nothing to do with it. So I approached this post—like I try to with every post—from a standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense.</p><p>2) Spoiler: The post is very pro-Tesla. Which might seem suspicious since A) Elon Musk asked me to write about this and B) I just wrote a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> calling him the raddest possible man. But two things to keep in mind:</p><p>First, this isn&#8217;t commissioned by Musk, and I&#8217;m being paid $0.00 for doing it. He suggested I take the issue on because I think he thinks there&#8217;s a lack of full tree trunks in people&#8217;s heads about it—but he never suggested that I say good things about Tesla, electric cars, or anything else.</p><p>Second, the currency Wait But Why lives on is integrity. Without it, WBW loses its ability to make an impact. And integrity came first here, even at the expense of Musk potentially hating me at the end of it, if that&#8217;s what was necessary. If I didn&#8217;t think this would have made a great WBW topic, I wouldn&#8217;t have taken it on, and I&#8217;m pro-Tesla in the post because after a ton of learning and thinking—including as many counterarguments to Tesla and its worldview as I could find—that&#8217;s how I feel.</p><p>And with that, let&#8217;s dive in.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 20pt;\">Contents</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">     <a href=\"#part1\">Part 1: The Story of Energy</a></span></strong><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"#part2\">Part 2: The Story of Cars</a></span></strong><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">  <a href=\"#part3\">Part 3: The Story of Tesla<br /></a></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a>Part 1: The Story of Energy</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3780 alignnone\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png\" alt=\"Story of Energy\" width=\"185\" height=\"163\" /></a></p><p>Energy is important.

The dictionary says it&#8217;s &#8220;the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform work.&#8221; And it says &#8220;work&#8221; is &#8220;the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.&#8221; Putting that together, we get energy being &#8220;the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.&#8221;</p><p>That was pretty unfun, so for our purposes, let&#8217;s call energy &#8220;the thing that lets something do stuff.&#8221;</p><p>But the tricky thing about energy is the law of conservation of energy, which says that energy can&#8217;t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another. And since every living thing needs energy in order to do stuff—and you can&#8217;t make your own energy—we&#8217;re all awkwardly left with no choice but to steal the energy we need from someone else.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3667\" id=\"note-1-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3667\" id=\"note2-1-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><sup>← <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">click these</span></sup></span></p><p>Almost all of the energy used by the Earth&#8217;s living things got to us in the first place from the sun.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3667\" id=\"note-2-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> The sun&#8217;s energy is what makes the wind blow and the rain fall and it&#8217;s what powers the Earth&#8217;s living things—the biosphere.</p><p>The joule is a common unit of energy—defined as the amount of energy it takes to apply a force of one newton through a distance of one meter<a href=\"#footnote-3-3667\" id=\"note-3-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a>. While the sun&#8217;s joules can provide any animal with heat and light, the joules that <em>power </em>all of us from the inside enter the biosphere in the first place when the sun gives them to plants.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3785\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png\" alt=\"Sun\" width=\"341\" height=\"347\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s how food is invented—plants know how to take the sun&#8217;s joules and turn them into food.</p><p>At that point, all hell breaks loose as everyone starts murdering everyone else so they can steal their joules.</p><p>We use &#8220;the food chain&#8221; as a cute euphemism for this murder/theft cycle, and we use the word &#8220;eating&#8221; to refer to &#8220;stealing someone else&#8217;s joules and also murdering them too.&#8221; A &#8220;predator&#8221; is a dick who always seems to want <em>your </em>joules over everyone else&#8217;s, and &#8220;prey&#8221; is just some sniveling nerd you particularly like to bully and steal lunch money from. Plants are the only innocent ones who actually follow the Golden Rule, but that&#8217;s just because they have the privilege of having the sun as their sugar daddy—and humans are the biosphere&#8217;s upsetting mafia boss who just takes what he wants from anyone he wants, whenever he wants. It&#8217;s not a great system, but it works.</p><p>And that all went on normally for a while, but in the last few hundred thousand years, humans started to realize something: while it was enjoyable to put new joules into your body, actually <em>using</em> those joules sucked. It&#8217;s much less fun to use a bunch of joules running fast or lifting something heavy than it is to just sit on a log pleasantly and hold onto those joules instead. So humans got clever and started to figure out ways to get joules<em> outside </em>their bodies to do work for them—by doing that, humans could have their joules and eat them too. Sometimes the methods would be dickish:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\" alt=\"Horse hand\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" /></a></p><p>But joules aren&#8217;t only in living things. There are joules floating and swirling and zooming all around us, and by inventing the concept of <em>technology</em>, humans figured out ways to get use out of them. They made windmills that could steal some of the wind&#8217;s joules as it went by and convert them into mechanical energy to grind food. They built sailboats that would convert wind joules into kinetic boat energy they could control. Water absorbs the sun&#8217;s radiation joules and turns them into gravitational potential energy joules when it evaporates and then kinetic energy joules when it rains and slides down land, and humans saw the opportunity to snatch some of those up by creating water wheels or dams.</p><p>But the most exciting joule-stealing technology humans came up with was figuring out how to <em>burn</em> something. With wind or water, you can only capture moving joules as they go by—but when you burn something, you can take an object that has been soaking up joules for years and release them <em>all at once</em>. A joule explosion.</p><p>They called this explosion fire, and because the joules that emerged were in the useful-to-humans formats of heat energy and light energy, burning things became a popular activity.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Taming a Dragon</strong></span></p><p>We had learned to <em>harness </em>the joules of the wind and the water—to take those forces by the reins and make them ours—but when it came to the most joule-heavy force of all, fire, we couldn&#8217;t really figure out how to do anything with it other than hang out near it, cook some stuff, and generally benefit from its existence. Fire was a hectic dragon and no one had figured out how to grab its reins.</p><p>And then came the breakthrough. Steam.</p><p>Fire joules were hard to harness, but if you sent them into water, they&#8217;d get the water molecules to increasingly freak out and bounce around until finally those molecules would fully panic and start flying off the surface, evaporating upwards with the force of the raging fire below. You&#8217;d have successfully converted the thermal energy joules of the fire—which we didn&#8217;t know how to directly harness—into a powerful jet of steam we could control.</p><p>With the muscle of steam in their toolkit, the inventors of the 18th century burst into innovation. They had some serious <em>joules </em>to work with now, which opened worlds of previously-unthinkable possibility. Breakthroughs led to more breakthroughs, and at the turn of the 19th century, the progress culminated in an invention that&#8217;s often called the most impactful turning point in human history: the steam engine.</p><p>Picture your tea kettle when it gets all angry at you and starts whistling. Now imagine that instead of the steam spewing out through the nozzle, you connected the nozzle to a tube, which directs the bursting steam into an empty cylinder and then finally releases it. When the steam goes into and then out of the cylinder, it shoves a &#8220;piston&#8221; inside the cylinder on a powerful back-and-forth motion. That&#8217;s (a dramatic oversimplification of) how a steam engine works. Depending on the vehicle, the back-and-forth motion of the piston can do different things. In the example of a locomotive, the piston is attached to a rod whose back-and-forth motion turns the wheels:<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3667\" id=\"note2-2-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3681 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif\" alt=\"rodsmed\" width=\"549\" height=\"168\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using the steam engine, humanity upgraded from sailboats to steamships and from animal-drawn carts to locomotives.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3667\" id=\"note-4-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> Inside factories, people put steam to work too, swapping out their water wheels for much more effective steam-powered wheels.</p><p>With the new ability to transport many more goods and materials, much farther away, much more quickly, and to far more efficient factories, the Industrial Revolution ignited in full force. People say the Industrial Revolution was powered by steam, but steam was just the middleman—after hundreds of thousands of years of existing as passive benefactors of combustion, we had tamed the dragon, and the Industrial Revolution was powered by <em>fire.</em></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Striking Gold</strong></span></p><p>The one thing about having made fire our bitch is that we now wanted to burn a lot more things than we ever had before. For most of human history, when people wanted to burn something, they just went and found some wood. Easy. Except now it was the 19th century, and with our new appetite to burn, wood wouldn&#8217;t cut it anymore.</p><p>We knew there were other things we could burn—in Britain, they would often supplement wood by burning a black rocky substance they found on their shores. They called it coal.</p><p>The problem is that unlike wood, most of the coal in Britain wasn&#8217;t just sitting conveniently on land—it was underground. When the Industrial Revolution got going, the British started digging—they were gonna need a lot of coal. As the revolution spread through Europe and to North America, Europeans and Americans started digging too—they also were gonna need a lot of coal.</p><p>As everyone dug, they started finding other things too. They found pockets of burnable air we call natural gas and underground lakes of thick, black burnable liquid we call crude oil. It turns out that this whole time, humans had been walking around with a vast untapped treasure of tightly packed, burnable joules right underneath them. It was like a dog digging in the woods to bury a bone and uncovering an underground cave full of pulled pork.</p><p>And what does a dog do who finds a cave of pulled pork? Does he pause to think cautiously about how to proceed or consider consequences for his health? No—he eats the shit out of it. Mindlessly, at full speed.</p><p>And throughout the 19th century, coal mines and oil rigs popped up everywhere. Burning this new treasure of joules made economies soar and the incentive to innovate soared along with them—and new, fantastic technologies were born.</p><p>Like steam engine technology, the credit for the electricity revolution is owed to a collaboration of dozens of innovators spanning centuries, but it was in the 1880s that it all finally came together. In what is still probably the most significant technological shift of all time, electricity allowed the raucous power of burning to be converted into a highly tame and remarkably versatile form of energy called electrical energy. With steam as a key middleman, all those spastic combustion joules could now be sent into an organized grid of wires, transferred long distances, and delivered into residential and commercial buildings where it would wait patiently in an outlet ready to be discharged at the user&#8217;s convenience.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3667\" id=\"note-5-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> At that point, the now electrical joules could be converted into almost any kind of energy—they could boil water, freeze ice, light up the room, or make a phone call. If steam had tamed the dragon, electricity had turned the dragon into a magical butler, forever at our service. And for the first time in human history, the power was on.</p><p>Right around the time this was happening, another revolution was underway. Fire was now powering our ships, our trains, our factories, and even the new wizardry of electricity, but individual transportation was still powered by hay like it was 1775—and late 19th century humanity knew we could do better. Biological horses got super upset if you tried to power them by fire, so again, humanity got innovating, and a couple decades later, there were big, metal, horses everywhere with engine cylinders full of fire.</p><p>As coal, oil, and natural gas motivated unprecedented innovation, the resulting waves of new technologies created an unprecedented need to burn stuff—which motivated the diggers. Companies that focused on digging, sucking, and siphoning up more and more of our underground joule treasure, like John D. Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil, became the world&#8217;s biggest corporate empires. It was a new world, powered by an endless cave of pulled pork, being gorged upon by the world&#8217;s happiest dog&#8230;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Flash forward to the present day.</p><p>Burning our bounty of underground joule-packed fuel to power our world is now an innovation more than two centuries old—but in 2015, it&#8217;s still the main way humans get their power:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3667\" id=\"note2-3-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3729\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png\" alt=\"Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s the thing about dogs—if given something delicious, they tend to eat until the food runs out or they get sick, whichever comes first, and there aren&#8217;t too many other factors in play. The modern energy debate essentially boils down to whether it&#8217;s okay that the dog is still fully enjoying himself in the cave or whether it&#8217;s not because he might be making himself dangerously sick or risk running out of pulled pork—which would be a problem, because he has grown increasingly large since finding the cave, and he has no way outside the cave of feeding his now-immense appetite.</p><p>As you might have noticed, there are a lot of people who have a lot of opinions for a lot of reasons saying a lot of things about this situation. And some are saying real things, but a large portion of them either don&#8217;t especially know what they&#8217;re talking about or they have some ulterior motive for saying what they&#8217;re saying. This makes an already complex, murky, multi-faceted topic even more confusing.</p><p>So let&#8217;s lay out what we do know and try to clarify what the hell is really going on.</p><p>To begin with—what exactly are fossil fuels and where do they come from?</p><p>Fossil fuels are called fossil fuels because they&#8217;re the remains of ancient living things. &#8220;Ancient&#8221; in this case spans a wide range. The earliest organisms that contribute to today&#8217;s fossil fuels lived during the Precambrian Eon, before there were any plants and animals on land—the fossil organisms then would have been ocean algae. People often think fossil fuels are made of dinosaurs, but any dinosaurs in our gasoline are from the last couple hundred million years—the later stretch of the timespan—and only a small contributor. The largest portion of our fossil fuels comes from plants, animals, and algae that lived during the Carboniferous Period—a 50 million year period that ended about 300 million years ago and during which there were lots of huge, shallow swamps. The swamps were important because it made it more likely that a dead organism would be preserved. You don&#8217;t become a fossil fuel if you die in a normal place and decompose away. But by dying in a swamp and sinking to the bottom, Carboniferous organisms often ended up being quickly covered by sand and clay and were able to make it underground with their joules still intact.</p><p>After hundreds of millions of years, all those organisms were squashed under intense heat and pressure and became converted into joule-dense solid, liquid, or gas—coal, oil, and natural gas. Quick blue box brush-up:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Fossil Fuels Brush-Up</strong></span></p><p><strong>Coal</strong>, a black sedimentary rock that’s found in underground layers called coal beds, is the cheapest and most plentiful of the three and is used almost entirely for making electricity. It’s also the worst culprit for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, releasing about 30% more CO<sub>2</sub> than the burning of oil and about double that of natural gas when generating an equivalent amount of heat.<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3667\" id=\"note2-4-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> The US is to coal as Saudi Arabia is to oil, possessing 22% of the world’s coal, the most of any nation. China, though, has become by far the world’s largest consumer of coal—over <em>half </em>of the coal burned in the world in recent years was burned in China.<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3667\" id=\"note2-5-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p><strong>Oil</strong>, also known as crude oil or petroleum, is a gooey black liquid normally found in deep underground reservoirs. When crude oil is extracted, it heads to the refinery, where it’s separated, using different boiling points, into a bunch of different things. Here&#8217;s how a typical barrel of US oil was broken down in 2014:<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3667\" id=\"note2-6-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><ul><li class=\"p1\">44.9% gas for cars</li><li class=\"p1\">29.8% heating oil and diesel fuels</li><li class=\"p1\">13.8% other products like wax, synthetic rubber, and plastics</li><li class=\"p1\">9.5% jet fuel (kerosene)</li><li class=\"p1\">2.0% asphalt</li></ul><p>The United States is by far the biggest consumer of oil in the world, consuming over 20% of the world’s oil and about double the next biggest consumer. The US is also one of the three biggest oil producers in the world, alongside Saudi Arabia and Russia, who all produce roughly the same amount.<a href=\"#footnote-6-3667\" id=\"note-6-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p><strong>Natural gas</strong>, which is formed when underground oil gets to a super-high temperature and vaporizes, is found in underground pockets, usually in the vicinity of oil reserves. The &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of the three fossil fuels, it&#8217;s the gas that fires up your stove or heats your apartment (if those aren’t electricity-powered or heated by oil), and it&#8217;s one of the major sources of electricity (it makes up about 20% of electricity in the US). Natural gas is on the rise and now makes up almost a quarter of the world’s energy. One of the reasons it’s on the rise is that scientists have found a new way of extracting natural gas from the Earth called hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” which uses a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals to create cracks in natural gas-rich shale and force out the gas. This method has been hugely effective, but it’s also controversial because of some serious environmental concerns—<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> explains it well.</p></div><p>As for the reasons people argue that fossil fuels are problematic, we&#8217;re going to focus on the two most common—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>ISSUE 1: Climate Change is a Thing</strong></span></p><p>Let&#8217;s ignore all the politicians and professors and CEOs and filmmakers and look at three facts:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 1) Burning Fossil Fuels Makes Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Rise</strong></span></p><p>We&#8217;ll get to the data in a second, but first—why does burning fossil fuels emit CO<sub>2</sub>?</p><p>The answer is simple: <strong>combustion is reverse photosynthesis.</strong></p><p>When a plant grows, it makes its own food through photosynthesis. At its most oversimplified, during photosynthesis, the plant takes CO<sub>2</sub> from the air<a href=\"#footnote-7-3667\" id=\"note-7-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> and absorbs light energy from the sun to split the CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon (C) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The plant keeps the carbon and emits the oxygen as a waste product. The sun&#8217;s light energy stays in the plant as chemical energy the plant can use.</p><p>So wood is essentially a block of carbon and stored chemical energy.</p><p>When you burn a log, all you&#8217;re doing is reversing the photosynthesis. Normally, oxygen in the air just bounces off carbon molecules in wood—that&#8217;s why trees aren&#8217;t constantly on fire. But when an oxygen molecule gets moving fast enough and <em>smashes </em>into a log&#8217;s carbon molecule, they <em>snap</em> together and the oxygen and carbon are reunited again as CO<sub>2</sub>. This snapping releases chemical energy, which knocks into other nearby oxygen molecules, causing <em>them </em>to get going fast—and if they get going fast enough, they&#8217;ll snap together with another of the log&#8217;s carbon molecules, which releases <em>more</em> chemical energy. This causes a chain reaction, and the log is now on fire. So a log burning is the process of the carbon in the log combining with oxygen in the air and floating off as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Of course, that&#8217;s all irrelevant to the person burning the log—what <em>they </em>care about is the <em>energy </em>released during all of this CO<sub>2 </sub>formation. The release of all of the log&#8217;s stored chemical energy creates a glorious blaze of heat and light. The tree spent years quietly absorbing carbon<sub> </sub>molecules and sunshine joules, and all at once, during combustion, that carbon and sunshine explode back out into the world.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3667\" id=\"note-8-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><p>To put it another way, photosynthesis just kidnaps carbon and sun energy out of the atmosphere, and after years of holding them hostage, combustion sets them both free—the carbon as a billowing eruption of newly reunited CO<sub>2</sub>, and the sun energy as fire—meaning that fire is essentially just tightly packed sunshine.</p><p>But burning a log and releasing all that CO<sub>2 </sub>does <em>not </em>tamper with the atmosphere&#8217;s carbon levels. Why? Because the carbon that&#8217;s being released was recently <em>in</em> the atmosphere, and if you hadn&#8217;t set the log on fire, it would have likely decomposed, which would release the carbon back into the world anyway. The log&#8217;s carbon was only being held <em>temporarily</em> hostage, and releasing it through combustion has little effect.</p><p>Carbon flows from the atmosphere into plants and animals, into the ground and water, and then back out of all those things into the atmosphere—that&#8217;s called the carbon cycle. At any given point in time, the Earth&#8217;s active carbon cycle contains a specific amount of carbon. Burning a log doesn&#8217;t change that level because the carbon cycle &#8220;expects&#8221; that carbon to be hanging around the ground, water, or air.</p><p>But sometimes, a small portion of carbon in the cycle drops <em>out </em>of the cycle for the long term—it happens when a plant or animal dies but for some reason <em>doesn&#8217;t </em>decay normally. Instead, before it can decay and release its carbon back into the cycle, it&#8217;s buried underground. Over time, that lost carbon adds up. And today, the Earth&#8217;s fossil fuels make up a huge mass of lost carbon—carbon that long ago was taken hostage <em>permanently</em>, and carbon that the carbon cycle does <em>not </em>expect to be involved in its routine.</p><p>When humans discovered all of this underground kidnapped carbon, you have to remember that for them, the carbon wasn&#8217;t the point. They were staring at an endless sea of 300 million-year-old, densely packed sunshine—trillions of ancient plants with their <em>joules</em><em> intact</em>—and since there are no laws protecting the estates of Carboniferous plants, we could seize it all for ourselves. The grandest joule theft in history.</p><p>And as we helped ourselves, we didn&#8217;t worry about the fact that extracting those joules also meant extracting carbon that had been buried as far back as the Precambrian period—there were locomotives to fuel and cars to power and buildings to heat, and the joules were irresistible.</p><p>And those joules have gone a long way—you can thank them for the comforts and quality of your life today. But those carbon molecules have gone a long way too.</p><p>Starting in 1958, scientist Charles Keeling started measuring atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels from an observatory on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Those measurements are still going on today. Here&#8217;s what they show:<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3667\" id=\"note2-7-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3790 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png\" alt=\"Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg\" width=\"475\" height=\"475\" /></a></p><p>The zig-zaggy motion of the line is due to the level falling each year in the summer when plants are sucking up CO<sub>2</sub> and rising up again during the winter when the leaves are dead. But the overarching trend is unmistakable. To put that into context, ice drilling technology<a href=\"#footnote-9-3667\" id=\"note-9-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> allows scientists to collect accurate data on what CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been throughout the last 400,000 years. Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve found:<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3667\" id=\"note2-8-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3707 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png\" alt=\"co2_variations\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" /></a></p><p>So atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels have oscillated<a href=\"#footnote-10-3667\" id=\"note-10-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> between about 180 and 300 parts per million over the last 400,000 years, never eclipsing 300, and suddenly in the last century the level has vaulted up to 400 (it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://co2now.org/\" target=\"_blank\">currently</a> at 403ppm).</p><p>So instead of the atmosphere being .02% or .03% carbon, it&#8217;s now .04% carbon and maybe moving towards .05% and higher. But let&#8217;s not judge anything yet. All we know is Fact #1, which tells us that CO<sub>2</sub> levels are rising quickly.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 2) Where Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Go, Temperatures Follow</strong></span></p><p>The ice cores dug up by scientists don&#8217;t just reveal the CO<sub>2</sub> levels going backwards in time—they reveal temperature too. Here&#8217;s what they show:<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3667\" id=\"note2-9-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3812\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png\" alt=\"temp graph\" width=\"538\" height=\"268\" /></a></p><p>Not a hard correlation to see. The reason for this is simple—CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas. The way an actual greenhouse works is the glass lets in sun energy and traps a lot of it inside as heat. There are a handful of chemicals in our atmosphere that do the same thing—sun rays come in, bounce off the Earth, and they&#8217;re on their way out when the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere block some of them and spread them through the atmosphere, warming things up.</p><p>Mars has an average temperature of -55ºC (-67ºF), which isn&#8217;t fun, but Venus is literally actual hell, with an average temperature of 462ºC (864ºF). No one is more of a dick than Venus. Why? CO<sub>2</sub>. Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth so the sun&#8217;s energy easily escapes, while Venus&#8217;s atmosphere is much thicker, with <em>300 times</em> the CO<sub>2</sub> as Earth, so it traps in a ton of heat. Mercury is <em>closer</em> to the sun than Venus, but with no atmosphere, it&#8217;s cooler than Venus. During the day, Mercury gets almost as hot as Venus, but at night it gets freezing, while Venus is just as hot at night as it is during the day, because the heat lives permanently in its thick atmosphere.</p><p>So it makes sense that an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> here would increase temperature—but by how much? When compared to the Pre-Industrial average temperature, our current average temperature has risen by a little less than 1ºC. But as CO<sub>2 </sub>levels keep rising, most scientists expect temperatures to keep rising. The UN-supported Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from a bunch of different countries, came out with <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> that laid out the temperature projections of a number of independent labs. This is what those labs think will happen if no action is taken to alter the current trends in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3667\" id=\"note2-10-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3715 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png\" alt=\"Global_Warming_Predictions\" width=\"398\" height=\"284\" /></a></p><p>A small minority argue that these future projections are overblown—they <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fossil-fuels-will-save-the-world-really-1426282420\" target=\"_blank\">point out</a> that they ride on the largely accepted theory that water vapor in the atmosphere multiplies the effect of carbon emissions because of a &#8220;feedback&#8221; loop, whereby a small increase in temperature from extra CO<sub>2 </sub>increases water evaporation, and since water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, that creates more warmth, which further increases more evaporation, and on and on. Without this feedback loop, the temperature increases resulting from CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions would be 2-3 times smaller. But even the greatest skeptics usually agree that CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions do lead to temperature increases.</p><p>The IPCC also puts it at over 90% that the changes in both CO<sub>2 </sub>levels and temperature are caused by human activity (which is kind of like saying there&#8217;s over a 90% chance that a rain storm has been caused by cloud activity). Now the question becomes—how much does the temperature need to change to make everything shitty?</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 3) The Temperature Doesn&#8217;t Need to Change Very Much to Make Everything Shitty</strong></span></p><p>18,000 years ago, global temperatures were about 5ºC lower than the 20th century average. That was enough to put Canada, Scandinavia, and half of England and the US under a half a mile of ice. That&#8217;s what 5ºC can do.<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3667\" id=\"note2-11-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3702 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"550\" height=\"210\" /></p><p>100 million years ago, temperatures were 6-10ºC higher than they are now—and every region of the Earth was tropical, there was no permanent ice anywhere, ocean levels were <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142729/Cretaceous-Period\" target=\"_blank\">200 meters</a> higher, and this kind of shit was happening:<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3667\" id=\"note2-12-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3810\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg\" alt=\"T-rex-120501\" width=\"297\" height=\"327\" /></a></p><p>So we&#8217;re currently in this not-that-big window we probably should try to stay in:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3763\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png\" alt=\"temp spectrum\" width=\"647\" height=\"303\" /></a></p><p>This is also even more fragile than is intuitive. First, you don&#8217;t need the <em>average</em> temperature to go up by a catastrophic amount to have a catastrophe—because the average temp could go up by only 3ºC but the <em>max </em>temp rises by a lot more. Just <em>one day</em> at an outlier high like 58ºC (136ºF) would wipe out most of the Earth&#8217;s crops and animals. Second, because the total range of temperature a planet can be goes all the way down to absolute zero: -273ºC (-459ºF). So a difference of 5ºC, enough to bury the northern part of the world under an ocean of ice, is really only about a 1.5% fluctuation in temperature—not something like 10%, which is what it seems like. Looking at the window on a spectrum that shows the full range emphasizes that the world we&#8217;re used to is what it is only because of a very specific and delicate balance of conditions.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3782\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"temp spectrum 2\" width=\"683\" height=\"255\" /></a></p><p>As mentioned above, right now, the average temp is edging upwards to 1ºC above the Pre-Industrial norm (the IPCC <a href=\"http://www.climatechange2013.org/\" target=\"_blank\">puts us</a> at +.86ºC currently). Scientists debate how high that number can go before really dramatic changes start to happen. For the last 20 years, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7242/full/nature08017.html\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 countries</a> have agreed to try to limit global warming to a 2ºC increase, but there are all of these different opinions going around about that. Regarding the effects of a 2ºC increase, in my research, I came across some credible sources saying 2º is an unnecessarily low ceiling and that that we can afford to safely go higher and others saying that 2º is <em>too</em> high a target and that we&#8217;re underestimating how catastrophic a change of 2º would be. Regarding our ability to stay under 2º, I&#8217;ve also heard varying opinions—some think we can stay under 2º with proper restrictions; others think there&#8217;s no possible way we can stay under 2º—that there&#8217;s enough upward momentum already that even if we stopped creating carbon emissions in the next few years, the Earth would keep warming past 2º.</p><p>So what are we supposed to make of this?</p><p>Our goal today is <em>not </em>to dig deep into these conflicting opinions and try to figure out the truth, because no one knows for sure anyway. We&#8217;re not going to talk about specific things like sea levels, pollution, storms, or that polar bear in the video who&#8217;s extra sad because his ice is melting. We&#8217;re just going to take our three facts and put them all together and see what happens:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3783\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel.png\" alt=\"Cancel\" width=\"686\" height=\"182\" /></a></p><p>This simplifies down to:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3784\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel-2.png\" alt=\"Cancel 2\" width=\"500\" height=\"62\" /></a></p><p>Interesting.

But actually, the Earth&#8217;s fossil fuel supply is not endless—it&#8217;s endful.</p><p><em>When </em>we run out is a complicated and hazy question. You have sites like <a href=\"http://knoema.com/smsfgud/world-reserves-of-fossil-fuels\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> citing reports like <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> making charts that suggest that if we continue as is, we&#8217;re not very far from the end:<a href=\"#footnote2-13-3667\" id=\"note2-13-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FFs-remaining.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3813\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FFs-remaining.png\" alt=\"FFs remaining\" width=\"600\" height=\"212\" /></a></p><p>Then you have sites like <a href=\"https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/our-green-energy/energy-independence/the-end-of-fossil-fuels\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> citing the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html\" target=\"_blank\">CIA World Factbook</a> and reminding us that when oil and natural gas run out, the coal usage will ramp up, so we actually have even <em>less</em> time:<a href=\"#footnote2-14-3667\" id=\"note2-14-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/end-of-fossil-fuels-graph.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3709 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/end-of-fossil-fuels-graph.jpg\" alt=\"end-of-fossil-fuels-graph\" width=\"475\" height=\"311\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fossil-fuels-will-save-the-world-really-1426282420\" target=\"_blank\">Other sites</a> point out that those cited totals are just referring to <em>proven</em> reserves, and that each year, we&#8217;re discovering new sources of fossil fuels, like oil locked in <a href=\"http://ostseis.anl.gov/guide/tarsands/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">tar sands</a> or abundant reserves of <a href=\"http://geology.com/articles/methane-hydrates/\" target=\"_blank\">methane hydrate</a> under the ocean floor, and developing new technologies to reach them, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA\" target=\"_blank\">fracking</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dccleaningsystem.com/development-tendency-of-horizontal-directional-drilling/\" target=\"_blank\">horizontal drilling</a>. Those sources suggest we&#8217;re unlikely to run out of fossil fuels for many centuries. A common counter to those sources is that even without running out, we could face a serious problem if the extraction of the fuels becomes more and more difficult and expensive over time.</p><p>The problem with running out, whenever it happens, is that if the world is anywhere near as reliant on fossil fuels at that point as we are now, it&#8217;ll cause an epic economic collapse. As fossil fuels grow more and more scarce, prices will skyrocket. That will cause a furious rush to develop renewable energy technology, but it may be too late at that point to prevent a worldwide economic meltdown.</p><p>Basically, we&#8217;re currently living off of a trust fund we found underground, and we&#8217;d better learn how to get a job before it runs out.</p><p>For our sum-up for this section, how about:</p><p><strong>At some point in the future, either really soon or just a little soon, we&#8217;ll have no choice but to stop running everything on fossil fuels, because they&#8217;ll either be gone or too expensive.</strong></p><p>This statement highlights the fact that we&#8217;re very much in what will be known as the Fossil Fuel Era of human history.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3766\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\" alt=\"FF Timeline\" width=\"700\" height=\"221\" /></a></p><p>Bringing back our first statement—<em>if we continue to burn fossil fuels as much as we are, things might get really shitty kind of soon</em>—suggests that if we continue to dick around in the black zone until we&#8217;re forced out by short supply, we&#8217;re risking <em>making the yellow zone permanently worse for humans to exist in. </em></p><p>This is why Elon Musk likes to say that the indefinite extension of the Fossil Fuels Era is &#8220;the dumbest experiment in history.&#8221; He emphasized this point to me: &#8220;The greater the change to the chemical composition of the physical, chemical makeup of the oceans and atmosphere [due to increased carbon emissions], the greater the long-term effect will be. Given that at some point they&#8217;ll run out anyway, why run this crazy experiment to see how bad it&#8217;ll be? We know it&#8217;s at least some bad, and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it&#8217;ll be really bad.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, as it relates to the above timeline—<em>there&#8217;s potentially huge long-term downside to staying in the black area for too long, so let&#8217;s just get ourselves to the yellow part as soon as we can. </em>Some skeptics I read made what seemed like very valid points, but even most skeptics agreed that burning of fossil fuels causes <em>some </em>degree of warming and that warming <em>might </em>turn out to be harmful. And even if we view this as a genuine debate—when one possibility is &#8220;turns out burning fossil fuels wasn&#8217;t actually dangerous&#8221; and the other side is &#8220;turns out burning fossil fuels was horribly catastrophic,&#8221; don&#8217;t we want to play it safe??</p><p>So how do we get from the black to the yellow?</p><p>To help us answer that question, let&#8217;s turn to the <a href=\"https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> and their useful energy charts. They update the US flowchart every year, and we&#8217;ll get there in a minute, but first, let&#8217;s check out some of the charts from their <a href=\"https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2011 report</a>, where they have a flow chart for every country and the world as a whole for the year 2007. (The charts look icky and confusing at first, but they&#8217;re actually really simple—just showing how much of each source is used and how that source is broken up among sectors.)</p><p>Here&#8217;s the<strong> combined world energy flow </strong>in 2007:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/World-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3802\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/World-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"World-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"592\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/World-2007.png\"><br /></a><br />
The unit, PJ, is in petajoules. 1 petajoule = 1 quadrillion joules. Some thoughts:</p><p>&#8211; The most consistent fact I noticed about all countries is how much petroleum (i.e. crude oil) dominates the transportation sector. 94% of the world&#8217;s transportation runs on oil, and in most developed countries, the percentage is even higher.</p><p>&#8211; Biomass use is pretty substantial, and almost all of it comes from developing countries, many of them in Africa. Biomass is typically the burning of things like wood, oil distilled down from food like corn, and manure.</p><p>&#8211; That&#8217;s a whole lot of rejected energy on the right side. Rejected energy is energy we lose, usually in the form of heat, due to inefficiency. Especially unimpressive is the transportation performance, where engines only end up using a quarter of the fuel they burn.</p><p>Next, let&#8217;s look at<strong> France:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3803\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"France-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"603\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/France-2007.png\"><br /></a><br />
Thoughts:</p><p>&#8211; Lots of nuclear, and as a result, very little coal. That makes France a pretty light CO<sub>2</sub> emitter.</p><p>&#8211; Their transportation, though, is like everyone else&#8217;s—running on oil.</p><p>&#8211; France is an example of a factor we&#8217;re not going to discuss in this post, but an important one: <strong>fossil fuels are a bit of a geopolitical nightmare</strong>. Nation interdependence can be productive and important, but nations being dependent on other nations for their <em>survival</em> is never a great thing, and the need to import fossil fuels is one of the major reasons for modern nation ultra-dependency. France is totally reliant on oil for its transportation and totally reliant on other countries for oil—this puts them in a vulnerable position. The US isn&#8217;t as dependent. It relied on other nations for 60% of its oil a decade ago but has since become one of the top three oil-producing countries, and the EIA <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/\" target=\"_blank\">projects</a> net oil imports to make up only 21% of the US&#8217;s 2015 oil consumption. I was also surprised <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_m.htm\" target=\"_blank\">to see</a> that only a small portion of US oil imports were from the Middle East, with only 12.5% of them coming from Saudi Arabia and 20% from the entire combined Persian Gulf. Far more was from the Western Hemisphere, with Canada by far the largest at 37% of imports and Mexico and Venezuela also prominent at 9% each.</p><p>Okay and how about <strong>China?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/China-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3804\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/China-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"China-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" /></a><br />
China is an energy monster, mostly because they&#8217;re an industrial monster. They&#8217;re also a coal-burning beast, burning through almost half of the world&#8217;s <em>total</em> coal consumption each year. That 57,000 PJ of coal consumption number is insane—over five times France&#8217;s total energy flow.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3805\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"598\" /></a><br />
Kind of a one-trick pony.</p><p>North Korea&#8217;s energy flow is, unsurprisingly, just weird:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3806\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"589\" /></a><br />
You can check out the <a href=\"https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">full report</a> to see the rest of the countries.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s move to 2013 and look at the <strong>US energy flow. </strong>The unit is different here. A quad = 1 quadrillion BTU, which is about 1,000 petajoules.<br /><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-2013-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3807\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-2013-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"US-2013-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"540\" /></a><br />
Two things that stand out:</p><p>&#8211; The US has become a natural gas consumption beast and by far the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/?view=consumption\" target=\"_blank\">biggest one</a> in the world.</p><p>&#8211; The US is even <em>more </em>of an oil-consumption beast—almost double the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/?view=consumption\" target=\"_blank\">second biggest</a> oil-consuming country, China, and more than four times #3 on the list, Japan.</p><p>To put in perspective how much energy the US uses, I found a country in the world that uses a similar amount of energy as each US state:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Energy-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3837\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Energy-Map.jpg\" alt=\"Energy Map\" width=\"900\" height=\"575\" /></a></p><p>Finally, let&#8217;s go back to the reason we started with these charts in the first place—to figure out how we&#8217;re gonna get from the black part of the timeline to the yellow and out of the fossil fuels area. The LLNL also produces a chart showing the US carbon emissions and where they come from. The US is the world&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8\" target=\"_blank\">second biggest</a> carbon emissions culprit (China is first with 50% more than the US) and the world leader in transportation emissions—so if we can figure out what the US needs to fix, that&#8217;s a good start.</p><p>Getting from the black to the yellow means getting rid of carbon emissions. Looking at the US emissions flowchart, I see two glaring numbers:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"US-Emissions-2013-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"594\" /></a></p><p>There are many things that need to happen to get us into the yellow zone, but these two figures—which make up 72% of total US emissions—seem like the biggest and most urgent problems to address:</p><p>1) Electricity production throughout the world makes up about 40% of the total energy flow, and roughly two thirds of electricity production comes from burning carbon-emitting fossil fuels, most prominently coal. Or, put simply: <strong>Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty.</strong></p><p>2) Transportation makes up a large chunk of the world&#8217;s energy flow, including near a third in most developed countries, and almost all the world&#8217;s transportation runs on petroleum. Put simply: <strong>Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve spent this post zoomed far out on all of this. Now it&#8217;s time to zoom in, and we&#8217;ll zoom in on the second major problem listed above—transportation, and in particular, cars. Transportation covers planes, trains, ships, trucks, and cars—but cars cause more carbon emissions than the other four combined, and without major changes, car emissions are <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAG&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FMcKinsey%2Fdotcom%2Fclient_service%2FSustainability%2FPDFs%2Froads_toward_low_carbon_future_new.ashx&amp;ei=YbRbVbKpHpDZgwTv1oHgCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3SEeN0mjEnhTVGWEcgP3FFGFzDg&amp;sig2=Ycq_mTE6XiZBtnFhiqOB0Q\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to rise by over 50% by 2030. By zooming in on one major piece of this puzzle—car emissions—and examining how it became a problem, why it&#8217;s still a problem, and the way we might solve that problem, we&#8217;ll get a better sense of what this entire struggle is really made of.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part2\"></a>Part 2: The Story of Cars</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Cars.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3779\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Cars.png\" alt=\"Story of Cars\" width=\"200\" height=\"176\" /></a></p><p>Meet the world&#8217;s first car owner.<a href=\"#footnote2-15-3667\" id=\"note2-15-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3703 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress.jpg\" alt=\"640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress\" width=\"272\" height=\"453\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s the Chinese Emperor, Kangxi, in his driving clothes.

Edison&#8217;s company was busy rolling out electrical generating systems to power US cities, and working on these, Ford got good at working with the steam-powered engines the company used to make electricity. In his spare time, Ford sat in a little workshop next to his home playing around with the still-novel concept of the internal combustion engine, and in 1896, at the age of 32, he came up with what he called the Ford Quadricycle, powered by a simple internal combustion engine.<a href=\"#footnote2-24-3667\" id=\"note2-24-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">24</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3822\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"FordQuadricycle-compressor\" width=\"500\" height=\"405\" /></a></p><p>Becoming increasingly obsessed with building self-propelled vehicles, Ford quit his job in 1899 and first formed the Detroit Automobile Company, which failed, before forming the Henry Ford company in 1901. But Ford soon left the company over a dispute with the company&#8217;s investors, who then renamed it Cadillac Automobile Company, and in 1903, he went on to partner with a guy named Alexander Malcomson to create a company called Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd., which was later renamed Ford Motor Company. Super annoying for Malcomson.</p><p>Ford and his new company charged ahead making gas-powered cars, but at the time, gas cars were hardly the norm. Cars were a new technology, and at the beginning of the century, 40% of American cars were powered by steam and 38% were electric—gas cars only made up 22% of the American market.</p><p>These numbers make sense. Steam-centered external combustion was the older and best-understood technology of the three and was initially the most common way to power a car. Its fancier new cousin, the internal combustion engine, powered by burning gasoline, cut out the middleman and burned fuel more efficiently. But it&#8217;s no surprise that the quickest up-and-comer type of car was the electric car. It was 1900 and electricity was at the core of all the coolest, newest technology.</p><p>The 35 years between the mid-1860s and the turn of the century had just witnessed an electricity revolution, driven by inventors like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, and George Westinghouse, during which the world went from normal to positively <em>magical</em>. The first magic happened in the middle of the century, when the telegraph used long-range electricity to communicate with people really far away, and in 1866, the first successful cross-Atlantic telegraph message was sent, allowing Europe and the US to magically communicate with each other <em>instantly</em>. The magic revolution hit full force in the late 1870s. The first telephone call happened in 1876, followed by the first time in human history someone could record sound and then play it back, in 1877. Light bulbs began to light up city streets in the early 1880s, and by 1896, the first electrical grid brought widespread electricity into people&#8217;s homes. Also in 1896, the first primitive motion picture went on display in New York, and the first wireless transmission of a human voice—the birth of the radio—went through in Brazil in 1900. Meanwhile, magical horseless cars were appearing on the streets, and only a few years later, in 1903, the Wright Brothers would take humanity&#8217;s first heavier-than-air flight. It&#8217;s hard to imagine how <i>insanely cool </i>a time this must have been for everyone.</p><p>And if you were alive around the year 1900, you&#8217;d probably equate modern tech with electricity, much the way we today equate modern tech with computers, smart phones and the internet. Edison and Tesla were their Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. The idea of powering transportation with a fiery engine dated back to the earliest locomotives almost 100 years earlier, which would seem about as modern to a person in 1900 as black-and-white silent films seem to us today. By 1900, you weren&#8217;t supposed to have to deal with how the energy sausage is really made anymore—the burning fire happened in some remote generator now, allowing consumers to only have to interact with the silent, clean, convenient magical butler—electricity.</p><p>So if someone in the year 1900 had to bet on the outcome of the battle between external steam combustion, internal gasoline combustion, and electricity as the future standard for powering cars, they&#8217;d have probably put their money on electricity. And at the time, electricity was not only winning the battle over gasoline with far more cars on the road, but the world&#8217;s most prominent inventors, including Edison and Tesla, were pouring their efforts into an electric car future. Early in the century, the New York Times referred to the electric car as &#8220;ideal,&#8221; citing it as quieter, cleaner, and more economical than the gas car.<a href=\"#footnote2-25-3667\" id=\"note2-25-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">25</a><p>But <em>ideal</em> wasn&#8217;t the driving force of the early auto industry—<em>scalable</em> was. Cars were, up until that point, fairly impractical toys for rich people. There would be time to idealize everything later—the first step was to figure out how to make the car fast, sturdy, and most importantly, affordable. Money and brains poured into car technology from all over the world, and in 1908, Henry Ford and his five-year-old company came out with the car that launched the automotive industry into the stratosphere: The Model T.<a href=\"#footnote2-26-3667\" id=\"note2-26-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">26</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3737 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg\" alt=\"1908-model-t-ford\" width=\"491\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>Before the Model T, there had been big problems with both electric and gas vehicles. Electric had shorter ranges and longer refueling times. Gas cars were loud, hard to start, and spewed smoke like it was 1802.</p><p>But Ford was a masterful industrialist, and by coming up with the concept of making cars by moving assembly line instead of hand-crafting them, he dramatically brought down costs and created America&#8217;s first car for the masses. In 1912, engineer Charles Kettering invented the electric car starter, eliminating the need to laboriously and dangerously hand crank your gas car on, and the newly invented muffler significantly reduced gas engine noise. Suddenly, a lot of the things that sucked about gas cars didn&#8217;t suck anymore—and they had become much cheaper than electric cars. Ford&#8217;s Model T took over America, and by 1914, 99% of new American cars ran on gas. By 1920, electric cars dropped entirely out of commercial production.<a href=\"#footnote2-27-3667\" id=\"note2-27-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">27</a><p>This was not an inevitable outcome. The future of cars had been up for grabs, and Ford had simply outsmarted his competition. Burning fuel was the way of the past and electricity was the way of the future—but Ford had created a provable, profitable business model for making cars, one that didn&#8217;t yet exist for electric cars, and it quickly became too much of an uphill battle for electric car makers to try to turn the tide. So they stopped.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Now it&#8217;s a century later. The most primitive local telephone call through a wire has become a person in Delhi being able to take a slab of glass out of his pocket, tap it with his finger, and instantly be talking to, and looking at, his friend in Sao Paulo. The grainiest, choppiest black-and-white silent movies have become Pixar. Mixing chemicals in a lab has become splitting atoms in the Large Hadron Collider. The Wright Brothers&#8217; 12 second, 120-foot flight has become routine trips 250 miles up to the International Space Station.</p><p>But instead of me finishing that paragraph with, &#8220;The primitive gas-burning car has become [something rad we can&#8217;t even imagine],&#8221; I have to finish it with, &#8220;The primitive gas-burning car has become the better gas-burning car.&#8221;</p><p>As I said, if you were alive in 1900, you&#8217;d have probably thought the idea of an AC induction electric car motor was awesome and futuristic, and the internal combustion engine, which was only an incremental advance from the early locomotive steam engines invented a century earlier, was kind of cool but not especially futuristic. But we&#8217;re not alive in 1900, we&#8217;re alive in 2015, so when <em>we </em>look at the modern gas engine that&#8217;s in all of our cars, and we see <em>pistons </em>moving back and forth because of something hot exploding inside their cylinders—<a href=\"#footnote2-28-3667\" id=\"note2-28-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">28</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3716 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\" alt=\"img11\" width=\"490\" height=\"347\" /></a></p><p>—they should seem <em>outrageously ancient</em>. Quick aside:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Tim Makes Passionate Car People Even More Furious By Describing How a Car Engine Works in a Clearly-Non-Car-Person Way Blue Box</strong></span></p><p>Welcome to the Tim Makes Passionate Car People Even More Furious By Describing How a Car Engine Works in a Clearly-Non-Car-Person Way Blue Box. Here&#8217;s the deal:</p><p>The animation above is of a four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. The four cylinders are those four tubes the pistons are moving up and down inside of. Each time a piston slides up or down, that&#8217;s called a stroke, and the fuel-burning happens in a four-stroke cycle:</p><p><strong>1) The Intake Stroke:</strong> This is the part where the piston is moving down and there&#8217;s blue stuff above it. The blue stuff is air that&#8217;s being sucked in along with a small amount of gasoline that&#8217;s fired in at just the right time by the fuel injector.</p><p><strong>2) The Compression Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke where the piston moves up and as it does, the blue stuff turns orange. What&#8217;s happening is that the valve that let the air in on the intake stroke has now closed and as the piston moves up, there&#8217;s nowhere for the air/gas mixture to go, so it just compresses really tightly.</p><p><strong>3) The Power Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke I feel like passionate car men talk about with a little twinkle in their eye. In the animation, this is where the piston moves down and there&#8217;s orange above it which then turns gray by the end. The previous compression stroke has squeezed the air and gas tightly, and at the top of that stroke, the spark plug at the top of the cylinder emits a spark which ignites the compressed air and gas on fire and creates a little explosion. This explosion blows the piston back downwards. This stroke is where the power of the car engine comes from.</p><p><strong>4) The Exhaust Stroke: </strong>This is the part where the piston pushes the gray stuff up and out of the cylinder. The gray stuff is exhaust—i.e. smoke because you just lit a campfire in that cylinder—that then makes its way out of the car&#8217;s tailpipe. This smoke consists of mostly non-toxic gases with a little carbon monoxide and other poison mixed in for fun. Also in the exhaust is the carbon dioxide that just got created during the explosion, which allows the long-buried carbon in the gasoline to happily re-enter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere after the most boring 300 million years ever underground.</p><p>The furious back-and-forth motion of the pistons work together to forcefully turn what&#8217;s called a crankshaft—that metal bar contraption they&#8217;re all connected to below—which creates the turning motion that eventually turns the car&#8217;s wheel axles. I think.<a href=\"#footnote-11-3667\" id=\"note-11-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a><p>(For more info: first two minutes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA_19bHxEYg\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> shows this all in action, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W_NRHxekaY\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> is aesthetically pleasing.)</p></div><p>Now. I&#8217;ll admit that car engines are cool. And I can see why some people are kind of obsessed with them. But when I look at these two animations next to each other—</p><p><b>1815 locomotive engine:</b></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed1.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3738 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed1.gif\" alt=\"rodsmed\" width=\"399\" height=\"122\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2015 car engine:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3716 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\" alt=\"img11\" width=\"400\" height=\"283\" /></a></p><p><em>—they look</em><em>too similar to be 200 years</em><em>apart.</em></p><p>&#8220;Hot explosions in cylinders pushing pistons back and forth to force metal bars to turn wheels and sending the resulting smoke billowing out of a pipe&#8221; <em>sounds </em>like an old-fashioned technology, and it&#8217;s just very odd that we&#8217;re still using it today. We get used to the world we live in, whatever that world is like, but if you examine history and take a big step back, some things suddenly make no sense. And this is one of them.</p><p>So the question we need to ask is why.</p><p>If electric motors were the more advanced technology—if they were considered <em>ideal</em> because they were quiet, clean, and took advantage of cutting edge technology—why did the world give up on them? In 1900, neither electric nor gas cars were viable for mass adoption—both needed a few key technological breakthroughs. The key breakthroughs needed for gas cars happened <em>first</em>—but why was that reason for us to just settle, <em>permanently</em>, for the more primitive technology and the one that, over time, would make our cities smoggy and change the chemical makeup of our atmosphere? If 20th-century human invention could go from the Wright Brothers&#8217; 12-second flight to the moon in just 66 years, surely advancing battery technology enough to bring electric car prices and charging times down while increasing range shouldn&#8217;t have been beyond our scope. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why did innovation and progress in something as important to the world as car-powering technology just <em>stop</em>?</span></p><p>This question could be asked about other parts of the bigger story of the Fossil Fuels Era. You could just as easily puzzle over the question, &#8220;America&#8217;s first electricity power station, Edison&#8217;s Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, first lit up in 1882, powered by burning coal—how is it possible that in 2015, burning coal is still by far the primary way humanity produces electricity even though we&#8217;ve known for decades that it&#8217;s not an optimal or sustainable long-term method?&#8221;</p><p>The problem with the question &#8220;Why did X technology stop moving forward?&#8221; is that it&#8217;s misunderstanding how progress works. Instead of asking why technological progress sometimes <em>stops</em>, we have to ask the question:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em>Why does technological progress ever happen at all? </em></span></p><p>The mistake of the first question is the intuitive but incorrect notion that technology naturally moves forward on its own over time—it doesn&#8217;t. I can tell you this for sure, because my Time Warner DVR has the exact same horrible user interface it had in 2004. The way technology works is that by default, it stands still, and it moves forward only when something <em>pushes </em>it forward.</p><p>We often have the same intuitive misconception when we think about evolution. Natural selection doesn&#8217;t make things &#8220;better&#8221;—it just optimizes biology to best survive in whatever environmental circumstances it finds itself. When something in that environment changes—a predator mutates and becomes faster, a certain type of food becomes scarce, an ice age rolls in—it means species that were previously optimized to the environment no longer are. The environmental change alters the natural selection criteria, which applies a <em>pressure </em>on the species as it is, and over time, the genetics of the species will react to the pressure by changing in order to optimize to the new environment.</p><p>When it comes to technology, a totally free and open market is the natural environment. But unlike the world of species, which is the eternal Wild West, human societies have another factor in play—a god-type force called government. So if we&#8217;re trying to figure out what makes technology move and change, we have to look at <em>two</em> sources of pressure: natural market conditions that ebb and flow and apply continual new pressures on all the actors within, and the &#8220;god&#8221; on top who can artificially change the environment below to create manufactured pressures. Let&#8217;s examine both, starting with government:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) Pressure From Government-Induced Environment Changes</strong></span></p><p>The nature and power of a market&#8217;s government-god varies significantly throughout the world. In North Korea, it is a Biblical-style, all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful ruler of the universe to the point where there <em>is</em> no natural market environment—just the one god created and maintains. In Scandinavia, god is a wealthy power mom and the market is nestled in her warm bosom of safety and opportunity. In Central Africa, god made a lifestyle change and got a new job, working for the wealthiest families—huge step up the ladder for him.</p><p>In the US, god has an identity crisis, alternating between feelings of pride and self-loathing. It wants to have the best country, but it&#8217;s standing on the street corner alone yelling out in an argument with itself about the right way to do that. When the US government (or a government like it) wants to play god and alter the American natural market environment to apply certain pressures in certain places, it uses three main tools: funding, regulation, and taxes.</p><p><strong>Funding: </strong>In order for government funding to lead to major progress, there has to be a lot of it, and in an open democracy, that only flies when the nation needs to do something so important that everyone agrees on it—like in the 1960s, when the fear of losing global influence kicked the US government&#8217;s adrenaline in and it put a man on the moon. Likewise, significant US military funding is something the American electorate can agree on enough that it receives tremendous funding and plays an important part in advancing technology in a number of industries. In most cases, though, a divided democracy is too paralyzed by conflicting interests and political squabbling to be the main driver of a serious tech revolution.</p><p><strong>Regulation: </strong>Another democratic government muscle is its ability to make rules—laws, restrictions, quotas, etc. These can be effective at pushing through minor changes—the seatbelt and airbag are both products of government regulation. But at least when it comes to the car industry, I&#8217;m having a hard time thinking of instances of major technological <em>leaps</em> caused by government regulation.</p><p><strong>Tax Code: </strong>The government often uses the tax code to add its own economic pressures into the free market. Again though, while this can be effective for <em>nudging </em>something in a certain direction, it doesn&#8217;t tend to lead to sweeping advances.</p><p>Of course, America is in a big fight about this, with fiscal liberals typically feeling a lot more optimistic about government&#8217;s ability to play a positive role in moving things forward than fiscal conservatives. But I think both would agree that major tech progress being <em>forced </em>forward<em> </em>by the government is more the way of places like the Soviet Union and modern-day China where government has a lot more power. The incredible innovation that often emerges from open democracies tends to come from pressures from below, in the bubbling cauldron of the free market—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) Pressures From Natural Market Forces</strong> </span></p><p>In the natural world, to catch food and stay away from predators, animals will optimize by becoming fast and elusive runners. When food on the ground becomes scarce, species will feel the pressure of hunger and over time, their genetics will re-optimize by developing good bodies for climbing or long necks or wings. A running species that becomes a flying species hasn&#8217;t become <em>better—</em>just better fit for the current circumstances. In the world of species, the definition of optimization is simple because the end goals are simple: the core needs of biological creatures are always the same—to self-preserve and reproduce. So optimization in the natural world always has the same definition: to adjust in a way that makes you mostly likely to self-preserve and reproduce.</p><p>In order to understand what optimization means in the market, we need to know what the core goals are of the actors there. Of course, people are also biological creatures, and self-preservation will always be at the top of the list—if you&#8217;re hungry, cold, or sick, fixing that will be the core goal. But for people whose base needs are being met, what are the yearning desires that then lie at the core of their motivation? What does &#8220;pursuing your self-interest&#8221; mean for them?</p><p>Well, it depends on the culture. In certain cultures, the fear of failure is so strong that it outweighs desires like glory or great fortune, and the primary inner drive becomes to just make sure you&#8217;re passable. In others, the deepest drive of the people might be religious salvation, community or family service, a leisurely lifestyle, or spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>When it comes to technological advancement, those motivations aren&#8217;t likely to get you there because thinking up tech innovations isn&#8217;t a helpful step on the path to optimization for those people. So if we want tech progress, what kind of yearning do we want people to feel?</p><p>I think the ideal mix is a two-part cocktail:</p><p><strong>First ingredient: Greed. </strong>In a perfect, fair, open market, greed works great as the core lifeblood motivation. The way capitalism theoretically works is that the more real-world value you create, the more money you&#8217;ll make. So companies in a competitive landscape will put their effort into creating better and better products and services in order to optimize, which for them means making as much money as they possibly can. Individual people are greedy as a means to all kinds of ends—a lavish lifestyle, personal freedom, security, admiration, power, sex—but <em>what</em> they want is irrelevant. As long as their burning desire makes them <em>really want stuff</em>, their drive to optimize will move technology forward. Greed is a double-edged sword though—to be beneficial, greed has to be contained inside a high-integrity, meritocratic, free market. If it&#8217;s not, greed will turn into the enemy of progress, because the more vulnerable the system is to corruption, the more the greedy on top will be able to game the system to ensure their own long-lasting victory.</p><p><strong>Second ingredient: Raging ambition.</strong> Greed can lead to steady forward progress, but in order for progress to <em>leap </em>forward, a second ingredient is usually key: a burning desire to do something great. Again, the underlying reasons for this kind of ambition can vary. Sometimes it&#8217;ll be an ego-driven desire—to be famous and renowned, to leave one&#8217;s mark, to be thought of and posthumously remembered as <em>great</em>. Other times the ambition will be fueled by a borderline-insane level of confidence and optimism that gives someone the gall to be idealistic. These are the yearnings of the <em>hungry underdog. </em></p><p>An established industry full of existing winners running on greed is like the highest layer of trees in a crowded rainforest. They&#8217;ll push upward only as needed, elbowing each other for little gains and victories as they vie for sunlight, mostly just trying to keep their spot in the canopy. Greed just wants sunlight—it doesn&#8217;t care how high up it is when it gets it.</p><p>But below, the hungry underdog <em>burns</em> for sunlight and will spend 100 hours a week trying to figure out how to get it. When the breakthrough comes, the underdog <em>bursts </em>up through the canopy into the open sky and spreads its leaves out wide. Suddenly, the trees that had been on top are blocked from the sun. Greed is then replaced by the much more powerful drive of <i>survival</i>, and innovation kicks into high gear as they scramble upwards for their life. The environment has changed—it&#8217;s been <i>disrupted</i>—and in this new world, created by the underdog disruptor, companies have to innovate in order to re-optimize. Some end up back on top, others die—and at the end of it all, technology has jolted forward. We all witnessed an example of this when Apple rocketed through the mobile phone canopy in 2007 and forced all of the other companies to make a smartphone or die. Samsung managed to get itself back into the sun. Nokia did not.</p><p>With all this in mind, let&#8217;s go back to the car industry and our original question:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Why hasn&#8217;t the car technology forest moved upward over the past century?</strong> </span></p><p>I see two primary reasons:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) Insanely high barriers to entry—so no leaps forward caused by hungry underdogs</strong></span></p><p>Try to think of something ickier and harder than starting a car company.</p><p>First, before you can sell one product, you&#8217;ll need to put down an absurd amount of capital to buy a factory, figure out how to design a car and all of its parts, build a prototype, use that to raise a lot more money, get a much bigger factory and hire thousands of people, and pump many millions of dollars into marketing to tell the world that your company exists. And you probably need to be incredibly rich and risk-tolerant yourself since very few people are zany enough to invest money in a startup car company.</p><p>Second, in order to be profitable, you have to sell at a high volume. Cars are too expensive to make and margins are too thin to only sell a few each year. So for this to be a good idea, you not only have to create an awesome car, but one that a ton of people will want to buy.</p><p>Third, gas cars are already well-optimized—if you want to aggressively burst through the canopy like an underdog without any brand awareness needs to, you have to create a <em>much better type of car than what&#8217;s out there</em>. In the case of cars, that probably means addressing the core of the car itself and the thing that&#8217;s been stressing everyone out with its billowing emissions—the engine. But since no one has really done this yet, it means you need to not only create the first successful startup car company in a long time, you need to create the first startup to <em>ever </em>succeed at making whatever type of car you&#8217;re creating. And since you&#8217;ll be there first to do it, you&#8217;ll have to put a huge amount of time and money into innovation research and development and bear the brunt of the invention costs for the whole industry. You&#8217;ll also have to bear the marketing costs to educate the world on why they should want this new type of car—that&#8217;s a one-time expense and once it&#8217;s done, other companies will be able to ride on the consumer demand you spent a ton of money building.</p><p>So it&#8217;s not surprising that the last successful startup car company in America was Chrysler in 1925—90 years ago. It&#8217;s basically an impossible endeavor.</p><p>And without any threat from below on the forest floor—from the wild innovation of scrappy entrepreneurs with nothing to lose—the car industry has had the luxury of calmly sunbathing in a tight canopy quilt, making only incremental advances, only when they&#8217;re needed. But there&#8217;s a problem here too—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) A glitch in the car market separates car company optimization from what&#8217;s best for the world.</strong></span></p><p>As I mentioned above, greed works nicely as an optimization criterion <em>if </em>the market is perfect—open, accurate, and fair.</p><p>Greedy companies will make their decisions based on whatever the best way is to optimize to their environment—i.e. How can we make the most possible money? But a company&#8217;s drive for maximum money is only beneficial to society when the company&#8217;s profit is tightly and accurately correlated with the amount of net positive value its product or service provides to society.</p><p>If I start a lemonade stand, every time I give someone a delicious cup of lemonade, they&#8217;ll be likely to recommend me to their friends and become a recurring customer. I provided positive value and my business&#8217;s success went up with it.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">Value Provided<span style=\"color: #000000;\">.</span></span> </strong>Incentives are aligned.</p><p>If another customer comes to the stand and I give him a cup of lemonade with a fly in it, he won&#8217;t come back and he&#8217;ll tell his friends not to go—I caused harm and my success went down.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">[Value Provided]</span> – <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[Harm Caused]</span>. </strong>Incentives still aligned.</p><p>But what if I then discover a chemical I can spray on my lemonade that prevents flies from landing on it. The chemical is tasteless, but I know that drinking it regularly will cause customers immense harm a few decades down the road. Customers won&#8217;t experience the harm in the present, so it won&#8217;t affect their opinion of my lemonade or the success of my business.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">[Value Provided]</span> – <del><span style=\"color: #808080;\">[Harm Caused]</span></del></strong><b>. </b></p><p>The harm caused is now an <em>unaccounted-for cost</em>, also known as a negative externality, and my incentives are no longer aligned with the customer&#8217;s best interests. If all I care about is greed and maximizing profit, I will continue to use the chemical, because I&#8217;m economically incentivized to do so.</p><p>This kind of negative externality is how tobacco companies got away with murder for so many decades. The long-term cost to customers&#8217; health was unaccounted for because customers were ignorant to the consequences, the negative effects were years away, and there was no regulatory penalty in place to charge for the harm. Thinking purely from a greed-optimizing perspective, cigarette companies acted completely rationally. They kicked up nicotine levels in cigarettes and added shards of glass into filters to create tiny cuts and increase nicotine absorption, which caused further harm but increased demand—but since the harm was unaccounted for, this was a pure net positive for the company. And when anti-tobacco campaigns started to educate customers on cigarette harm—which attaches the harm to the cost of scared customers and lower demand—the tobacco industry hired low-integrity scientists to discredit the negative campaigns and muddle the message. Awareness would get there eventually, but the longer they could delay and keep the harm hidden, the better off they&#8217;d be from a greed standpoint.</p><p>People call this evil, but all it really is is an industry acting in its own best interests within the parameters of its environment. Greed is a simple motivation—it takes whatever it can get, and it&#8217;ll push all available limits it can in order to fully optimize. I used tobacco companies as an example, but you could easily tell the story with fast food, radiation-emitting consumer electronics, politician behavior, the finance industry, and many others.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In the auto industry, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the negative externality.</span> If you have a cheap and easy way to build cars that dump garbage into the atmosphere and no one makes you pay for it, why would you ever change anything?</p><p>It&#8217;s the same story as cigarettes. Instead of the tobacco industry and the cigarette companies who support it, you have the oil industry and the car companies who support it. Instead of short-term emphysema, you have short term city smog. Instead of long-term harm to people&#8217;s health like lung cancer, you have long-term harm to the human way of life like underwater coastal cities.</p><p>A lot of people have written about the hidden cost of carbon emissions, and many of them, on <a href=\"http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">both</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/opinion/paul-krugman-conservatives-and-climate-change.html\" target=\"_blank\">sides</a> of the political spectrum, have proposed a logical solution: <strong>a revenue-neutral carbon tax.</strong></p><p>A revenue-neutral carbon tax is revenue-neutral because any increase in government revenue as a result of the tax would be offset by an equal decrease in something else like income taxes. This makes it a politically moot proposal.</p><p>The tax could be applied at any point along the supply chain from oil extraction to the gas pump and the effect would be the same—it would either become more expensive to drive a gas car, less profitable to be in the business of gas, or both. With a carbon tax in place, when you&#8217;re contributing to the carbon problem, you&#8217;re also paying for it—which incentivizes consumers and companies to explore alternatives. This wouldn&#8217;t be the government meddling in the market—it would be the government fixing a glitch in the market.</p><p class=\"p1\">Instead, the government offers tax breaks to people for buying an electric vehicle and subsidies for the renewable energy industry, which is like a town full of businesses who throw their trash in the street, and the government reacting by paying businesses to stop doing that, instead of just charging businesses for doing it. Other times, the government tries to force emissions downwards by forcing car companies to create a minimum number of zero-emissions cars—with limited effect. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton both tried this, to some extent, and both times the next president (Reagan and Bush) removed the regulations upon taking office (ironically, the Clinton mandate for more hybrid cars accomplished nothing in the US, but it scared the shit out of Toyota, who began furiously innovating and created the Prius). Another time, in 1990, the California government tried to institute its own zero-emissions regulations, which the car and oil companies fought until they finally bullied California out of it and the regulations were removed in 2003.<a href=\"#footnote-12-3667\" id=\"note-12-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a> The problem is, giant companies have enough influence that any government attempt at making changes through regulation ends up being watered down to the point where it&#8217;s ineffective.</p><p class=\"p1\">When it comes to a carbon tax, the only explanation for not having one seems to be the power big oil has over the US government—because to me, it seems like every politician in either party should be in favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Right?</p><p>Without any negative consequence of emitting carbon, optimizing for greed pushes certain car technologies forward, like safety, comfort, and drive quality, because getting high safety and quality ratings is tied to demand—but it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> change anything about carbon emissions, because the greed equation doesn&#8217;t currently include that cost.</p><p>So the reason why, 112 years after Ford Motor Company&#8217;s founding, we&#8217;re still using harmful, old-fashioned engines is simple: none of the pressures on the car industry are pushing it to change. The car industry still needs to work hard to optimize in <em>certain</em> areas—that&#8217;s why cars have become safer, smoother, more comfortable, and more efficient over the years. But the most glaring flaw of the modern car—that it constantly dumps garbage into the atmosphere—remains untouched, because doing so is free, because big oil&#8217;s influence means government keeps allowing it, and because there&#8217;s no one from underneath to burst through the canopy and show customers that there&#8217;s a better way.</p><p>It&#8217;s scary. Something really, terribly bad might be happening that could make our actual lives legitimately worse in the future, but we have a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma on our hands—it&#8217;s much, much better for all of us collectively to make a change, but for <em>each individual </em>CEO, lobbyist, or politician, there&#8217;s more to <em>personally </em>gain from maintaining the status quo. People like to say, &#8220;this is the world our children will live in and we&#8217;re botching it for them,&#8221; but for the people with the power to change something, their <em>particular</em> children will be best off if they make the most money possible. The situation is stuck.</p><p>A deeply-set, stagnant industry is like a country led by a deeply-entrenched dynasty—it&#8217;s hard to penetrate the status quo. But even in the case of the most powerful caste systems, sometimes the right person comes along at the right time and starts the right movement, and a revolution can ignite.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part3\"></a>Part 3: The Story of Tesla</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3781\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png\" alt=\"Story of Tesla\" width=\"182\" height=\"182\" /></a></p><p>Christie Nicholson remembers meeting Elon Musk for the first time at a party back in 1989.</p><p>“I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was ‘I think a lot about electric cars,’” Christie said. “And then he turned to me and said, ‘Do you think about electric cars?’”<a href=\"#footnote-13-3667\" id=\"note-13-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a><p>Electric cars seems like an odd thing to spend your time thinking about in 1989. To understand why Musk felt so strongly about them, let&#8217;s start by understanding what electric cars are and how they work.</p><p>There are a handful of common modern types of cars considered greener than traditional gas cars—namely hybrid cars, plug-in hybrid cars, and electric cars (which we&#8217;ll call EVs for &#8220;electric vehicles&#8221;). There&#8217;s also a lot of talk about another type—hydrogen fuel cell cars, which we&#8217;ll just call hydrogen cars. The one thing these cars all have in common is an electric motor.</p><p>There are two types of electric motors—the AC induction motor and the brushless DC electric motor. Since 98% of people reading this aren&#8217;t licking their lips to read a three-paragraph description of the difference, let it suffice to say that they&#8217;re the same basic idea:</p><p>An electric motor is a <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/432632095_8b49ad80ba.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">pig in a blanket</a> where electricity is sent into the outer bread part (called the stator), which is always stationary, and that electric current causes the hot dog part (called the rotor) to rotate. The rotor is attached to the wheel axle which turns the wheels. Like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-29-3667\" id=\"note2-29-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">29</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3696 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif\" alt=\"indhvtuiction\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><b>How an AC Induction Motor Works Blue Box</b></span></p><p>One of the two common types of electric motor is the AC induction motor (that&#8217;s what Tesla cars use). AC stands for alternating current,<a href=\"#footnote-14-3667\" id=\"note-14-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a> and induction means there&#8217;s no physical contact between the rotor and the stator—electricity in the stator generates a rotating magnetic field which enters the rotor through electrical induction and causes it to spin.</p><p>The stator generates a rotating magnetic field by sending electricity through it in a three phase system:<a href=\"#footnote2-30-3667\" id=\"note2-30-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">30</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3698 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif\" alt=\"inductionmotoranimation\" width=\"513\" height=\"342\" /></a></p><p>So there are three different wires each with an alternating back-and-forth pull—just look at any one color and you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s just going back and forth. But the three wires&#8217; currents are staggered in just the right way that the point of &#8220;pull&#8221; in the stator rotates in a smooth circle. When the rotor is added in, this rotating magnetic field causes it to spin:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3697 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif\" alt=\"generatoranimation\" width=\"485\" height=\"323\" /></a></p><p>The idea is that the rotor can never quite catch up to where it wants to be—it&#8217;s always &#8220;chasing&#8221; the rotor&#8217;s field, and that chase is what powers the car. The AC induction motor was invented by Nikola Tesla, and that&#8217;s why Tesla Motors is named after him.<a href=\"#footnote-15-3667\" id=\"note-15-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></div><p>Here are the types of cars that use an electric motor:</p><p><strong>Hybrids </strong>(also called HEVs for hybrid electric vehicles), like the Toyota Prius, have both an electric motor <em>and </em>an internal combustion engine. You don&#8217;t plug a hybrid car in—the gas charges the battery. The battery also gets charge from an electric motor trick called regenerative braking. Normally, all the joules of kinetic energy a car is harnessing when it&#8217;s moving are lost when the car brakes and they&#8217;re just converted into heat. With regenerative braking, electric cars send some of that kinetic energy back into the battery, holding onto those joules to be used again later. The electric component of a hybrid replaces some of the need to burn gas, increasing the miles per gallon, decreasing the car&#8217;s emissions, and saving the driver gas money. Hybrids are a big step up in technology from normal gas cars.</p><p>But they still kind of suck. Why? Because they&#8217;re only kind of helping the emissions problem, not solving it, and they still need to burn gas to work. As I&#8217;ve heard people say, a world 100% full of Prius drivers is still a world 100% addicted to oil.</p><p><strong>Plug-in hybrids </strong>(also called PHEVs) are a better option. Plug-in hybrid cars, like the Chevy Volt, the Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid, and the Ford Fusion Energi, allow you to charge the battery at home and typically drive 10-40 miles just on battery power before the gas kicks in. That&#8217;s often enough to get most people through most of their day, meaning they may rarely need to use gas.</p><p>But if we&#8217;re gonna get <em>so close</em>, why not just go all the way?</p><p><strong>Hydrogen cars </strong>are entirely electric—but they don&#8217;t use a battery. Instead, they fill up with fuel at a station just like a gas car—except they fill up with compressed hydrogen, not gas. The hydrogen mixes with oxygen in the air to produce electricity, which it sends to the motor to power the car. They produce no tailpipe emissions because the only byproduct is clean water. Sounds great, right?</p><p>Musk, for the life of him, cannot understand how anyone could make an argument in favor of hydrogen cars,<a href=\"#footnote-16-3667\" id=\"note-16-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> but it&#8217;s confusing because lots of car companies, like Toyota, Honda, and General Motors, are currently pouring big investments into making hydrogen cars. I wanted to understand the disagreement, so I read like 12 articles in favor and opposed to the technology. At the end of it, I&#8217;m having a hard time seeing why hydrogen cars would have a more promising future than electric vehicles. For those who want details, here&#8217;s a footnote.<a href=\"#footnote-17-3667\" id=\"note-17-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a><p>Finally, there are <strong>electric cars, or</strong><strong>EVs</strong>, like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Ford Focus Electric, and the Tesla Model S.<strong> </strong>These are simple—there&#8217;s a big battery, which you charge, and it powers the electric motor. No liquid involved.</p><p>Now, in <em>theory</em>, EVs make a lot of sense. Forgetting the rest of the car for a second, let&#8217;s look at some of the advantages of the electric motor over the internal combustion gas engine:</p><p><strong>Electric motors are more convenient than gas engines most of the time. </strong>Gas cars have to go to the gas station; EV owners plug their car in every night the same way they charge their phone—no stopping for gas. A gas engine is a lot more complicated than an electric motor, with over 200 parts; an electric motor has fewer than 10. A gas engine requires a transmission, a tailpipe, gears, and a bunch of other grease-covered shit; an EV has none of those things—when you open the hood, it&#8217;s more storage space, like the trunk. Gas engines need oil, which means they need oil changes; EVs don&#8217;t. The extra complexity means gas cars end up needing a lot more maintenance than EVs.</p><p><strong>It costs a lot less to power an electric motor than a gas engine. </strong>The extra costs gas car owners incur for oil changes and car repairs aside, the gas engine&#8217;s fuel—gas—is much more expensive than the electric motor&#8217;s fuel—electricity. Let&#8217;s look at the math:</p><p>The average electric car gets about 3 miles per kWh<a href=\"#footnote-18-3667\" id=\"note-18-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> of electricity, and the US national average electricity rate is 12 cents per kWh. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">That means that driving a mile in an electric car costs about 4 cents. </span></p><p>The cost of driving a gas car is harder, because gas prices and car fuel efficiency widely vary. The best case scenario for a gas car is unusually cheap gas (let&#8217;s say $1.40/gallon) coupled with unusually high fuel efficiency (let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a rare gas car that gets 35 mpg). That would produce the same 4 cents/mile that electric cars get. But very few gas car owners ever pay 4 cents/mile. Without being crazy extreme, for the worse case scenario, let&#8217;s say a high $4.00/gallon gas and a below-average 15 mpg—in that case, a mile in a gas car costs 27 cents per mile. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">At a pretty typical 12,000 miles/year, that means at absolute best, gas is tied with electric for cost, and at worst, it costs over $3,000/year more to drive on gas.</span></p><p><strong>The gas engine is one of the two major causes of the energy/climate crisis. </strong>We&#8217;ve already discussed this—transportation burning oil makes up a third of the world emissions, pollutes cities, and makes nations over-dependent on other nations. The electric motor emits nothing. Yes, it may run on electricity that was produced in a dirty way—but we&#8217;ll get to that later.</p><p>So that&#8217;s why Musk told Christie Nicholson that he thinks a lot about electric cars. The electric motor is clearly the easier, cheaper, and more sensible long-term plan for powering cars.</p><p>But when the electric motor made its first appearance over 100 years ago, there were serious drawbacks that prevented it from becoming the norm—and since electric cars went out of production back then, little time or money has been spent trying to fix those issues. There tend to be three age-old concerns about the viability of the electric car:</p><p><strong>EV Concern 1) Range. </strong>This is really three issues rolled into one:</p><p>A) Will the battery life be too short for long drives, limiting an EV to a car only for local driving?</p><p>B) If I&#8217;m out and about and need to recharge my battery on the road, is there anywhere to do it? Or will I end up stranded?</p><p>C) If I do find a charging station while on the road, will I have to sit there for five hours while it charges?</p><p>These issues are such a prevalent concern among potential EV-owners that they have their own term: range anxiety.</p><p><b>EV Concern 2) Performance. </b>The most common electric vehicle you&#8217;ll see around today is the golf cart. Which doesn&#8217;t excite car owners very much. No one wants a car that drives like shit, and when people think about zooming acceleration, they tend to think about powerful gas engines, not electric motors.</p><p><strong>EV Concern 3) Price. </strong>Ever since the beginning, EVs have cost more than gas cars, mainly because of the high cost of the battery.</p><p>Back in 1910, people cited these exact same three concerns over electric cars, and they&#8217;re part of the reason gas cars won the day. Gas cars had had their own major problems, but Ford had figured out how to make them viable—something no one has yet done for the electric car.</p><p>I asked Musk about his opinion on Henry Ford. He said, &#8220;Ford was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn’t know what they needed.&#8221;</p><p>When he decided in 2003 to stop thinking about electric cars and start making them, the odds weren&#8217;t in Musk&#8217;s favor. There were the high barriers to entry that had prevented any startup car company from succeeding in almost a century; there was the unaccounted for cost of carbon emissions, which made starting an EV company like trying to stand out on a basketball court as a rookie when all the players except you can foul with no penalty; there was the gargantuan oil industry, which would do everything in its power to stomp on any effort to make it obsolete; and on top of that, the EV was a new kind of car whose development had essentially been on pause ever since EV makers threw in the towel a century earlier, and a daunting and costly catch-up process would lay ahead—the three concerns listed above would all need to somehow be addressed for this to have a chance.</p><p>The overarching question was, had electric cars never had their day because of irreconcilable issues? Or had the right person—the Henry Ford of EVs—just not come along yet?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Car companies aren&#8217;t supposed to start in Silicon Valley, and Silicon Valley startups aren&#8217;t supposed to make cars.</p><p>But the electric car industry is not your grandfather&#8217;s car industry. And in 2003, it wasn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s car industry. After the brief bubble of new electric cars in California in the 1990s between the year the state passed the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate and the year they were bullied into repealing it, the electric car industry had withered into the oblivion of the scattered California garages and tech labs of car geeks. But big things have emerged out of small groups of cutting-edge California geek labs. Apple. Microsoft. Google. So why not the modern electric car industry?</p><p>One of these little car technology companies was AC Propulsion, and while carmakers in Detroit, Tokyo, and Munich continued to not realize that electric cars were clearly the future, the guys at AC Propulsion were experimenting away, quietly making one giant EV breakthrough after another.</p><p>One day last week, I cold called AC Propulsion and accosted their CTO, Paul Carosa, who had been there since the beginning. He was too polite to figure out how to get off the phone with me, so he told me about those years in the late 90s and early 2000s when they created their fanciest car to date—the tzero (pronounced t-zero). AC Propulsion had figured out two huge things:</p><p>First, the tzero was <em>fast—</em>it went 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds, which was crazy fast for an electric car and put it on par with the fast gas cars.</p><p>Second, they had made big progress on an enormous EV shortcoming by getting innovative with the battery. Previous EVs had used lead-acid batteries, which were heavy and limited. AC Propulsion realized that the laptop and mobile phone industry had been pouring development into making small 18650 lithium-ion batteries increasingly efficient, and that those batteries had gotten <em>really</em><em> </em>advanced. 18650 batteries look like AA batteries, which seems like an odd match for a car, but by lining up a few <em>thousand </em>of them in a big battery case, they had just created by <em>far </em>the world&#8217;s best ever car battery. EVs had always been limited to a 60 or 80 or <em>maybe</em> a 120-mile range. The tzero could go 250 miles on a single charge.</p><p>In 2003, a California engineer named JB Straubel was then tinkering around with EVs himself, met Musk to ask for funding for a car project he was working on. Soon after that, Straubel brought Musk by the AC Propulsion office to see the tzero. Musk was blown away. Musk had suspected for a while that EVs were the way of the future, and now that he saw the possibilities with his own eyes, he was convinced.</p><p>At the time, he was already running SpaceX and trying to colonize Mars, so launching a startup car company wasn&#8217;t something he could really fit into his calendar. He really wanted the world to see the tzero because he was sure it would excite people and help to stoke a new wave of EV interest—and he tried to convince the AC Propulsion guys to bring the tzero to market, with his funding, but they didn&#8217;t want to deal with that because it sounded icky. Instead, AC Propulsion introduced Musk to a group of three other entrepreneurs who had also recently approached them with a similar idea and had also been rebuffed. Those three guys, who included Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, had come up with the idea of licensing AC Propulsion&#8217;s technology and bringing it to market themselves as a new company called Tesla Motors<a href=\"#footnote-19-3667\" id=\"note-19-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a>—but to make any of this real, they needed money. It was a perfect match, so they decided to make a run at it together. Musk, who could only dedicate part time to the project, could fund the effort, become Chairman and maintain a strong influence, but by making Eberhard CEO, he could focus on SpaceX with the bulk of his time. And Tesla was on its way.</p><p>The group formed a team and started figuring out how to be a car company. One big problem they had was that this was a new technology, and the R&amp;D costs early on for a new technology drive up the price of the product—that&#8217;s the same reason the very first cell phones and computers started out really expensive. Except in those cases, they were the first of their kind, so the product could be super expensive and still sell. Because perfectly good, affordable gas cars already exist, it wouldn&#8217;t work to come out with the equivalent quality of a $25,000 gas car for $100,000+. So this became the business plan:</p><p><strong>Step 1: High-priced, low-volume car for the super rich.</strong> Come out with the expensive first product, but make the car so fancy that it&#8217;s worth that price—i.e. just make it a legit Ferrari competitor and then it&#8217;s okay to charge over $100,000 for it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Mid-priced, mid-volume car for the pretty rich. </strong>Use the profits from Step 1 to develop the Step 2 car. It would still be expensive, but more like a $75,000 Mercedes or BMW competitor instead of Ferrari.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Low-priced, high-volume car for the masses. </strong>Use the profits from Step 2 to develop a $35,000-ish car that, after the government&#8217;s $7,500 EV tax credit and the savings on gas, would be affordable to the middle class.</p><p>It&#8217;s kind of a Hershey&#8217;s Kiss business plan:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3791\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png\" alt=\"pyramid\" width=\"527\" height=\"397\" /></a></p><p>The overarching mission wasn&#8217;t to build the biggest car company in the world. It was to solve a bunch of long-standing EV shortcomings and build such an insanely great car that it could change everyone&#8217;s perception of what an EV could be and force the world&#8217;s big car companies to have to develop their own line of great EVs. Their end goal, and the company&#8217;s official mission, was &#8220;to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.&#8221; In other words, EVs are gonna happen, but we&#8217;re gonna make them happen a lot <em>sooner</em>. Sooner, in this case, is important, because it means carbon emissions decrease earlier and the long term effects of them are much less damaging.</p><p>So they got working. And four years later, they had their Step 1 car, the<strong> Roadster:</strong><a href=\"#footnote2-31-3667\" id=\"note2-31-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">31</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3739 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla1\" width=\"506\" height=\"337\" /></a></p><p>With the Roadster, Tesla wasn&#8217;t trying to make their long term car (one Tesla employee told me that from the beginning, Musk would make sure everyone knew that the company&#8217;s long-term mission &#8220;was <em>not</em> to make toys for rich people.&#8221;) They just wanted to build something awesome to A) show the world how great an EV could be, and B) generate revenue to develop their Step 2 car. So they didn&#8217;t start from scratch on the body design, instead basing it on a Lotus Elise.</p><p>The Roadster didn&#8217;t change the world—no $110,000 car ever could—but it sent a message to the industry that Tesla was for real. You may not have heard of the Roadster when it was announced in 2006 or when it started shipping in 2008, but some of the major car companies took notice—Nissan soon launched the all-electric Leaf and GM launched the plug-in electric Chevy Volt soon after the Roadster&#8217;s appearance (Bob Lutz, who was Chairman of GM at the time, openly credits Tesla for their decision to make the Volt, saying that after the Roadster unveiling, he went to the GM board and asked, &#8220;If a little company in California can do this, why can’t we?”).</p><p>But there were some pretty big problems with the first product. Finishing the car was taking way longer than planned, the cost of making each Roadster was way higher than planned, and the early shipments often had defects. This made Musk sad, so he and the board fired Eberhard as CEO, which made Eberhard sad.<a href=\"#footnote-20-3667\" id=\"note-20-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a> Just as this was going down, the most inconvenient thing ever happened—the 2008 recession—which made the entire car industry sad, but especially Tesla, who didn&#8217;t yet have brand recognition and wasn&#8217;t yet profitable because of all the upfront investment they had been pouring in. A crippling recession is never helpful, but it was <em>really, really </em>bad timing for Tesla.</p><p>Musk had hired a second CEO, but a year in, in late 2008, the company was in one of those movie scenes where the person&#8217;s been badly wounded and clearly about to die and there&#8217;s this dramatic dialogue scene and the dying person is saying some last words and every time they pause for a second the audience is like, &#8220;Is that it? Are they dead? Oh no they just talked again I guess there&#8217;s one more line.&#8221; Musk, who wasn&#8217;t enjoying the drama of the scene, finally was like, &#8220;PAUSE THE MOVIE QUICKLY PAUSE IT PAUSE IT&#8221; and took over as CEO,<a href=\"#footnote-21-3667\" id=\"note-21-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a>going into full adrenaline mode to try to keep the company alive. And as mentioned in the last post, SpaceX was in the same movie at the same time playing the same role, so Musk&#8217;s life was like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3772\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png\" alt=\"S-T\" width=\"550\" height=\"342\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But enough people had been impressed enough by Tesla that a couple key investments at critical moments came in and kept the company alive, and at the end of the whole mess, Tesla was now a new company. Musk was CEO, and the Jonathan Ive of the car industry, star car designer Franz von Holzhausen, who had been the Design Director at GM and then Mazda, had decided to bet his career on the barely-standing Tesla and became their chief designer.</p><p>A few weeks ago, when I stepped into the Tesla design studio to meet von Holzhausen, I was excited to meet the uber-flamboyant diva celebrity car designer, just hoping I would understand what he was saying through his unbelievably thick German accent—and was horribly disappointed to meet an extremely normal-acting American man.</p><p>The studio, which I described in the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">last post</a>, is a shiny playroom of art and physics. Von Holzhausen showed me a full-size clay car that was simultaneously testing two different possible designs for the upcoming Model 3 by making the two halves of the model different. He explained how precise everything about car design is and how &#8220;a difference of a quarter millimeter can spread itself across the entire car.&#8221;</p><p>I asked him what it was like to come to Tesla after having spent years at more established car companies. He described the difference like this: &#8220;A company like GM is a finance-driven company who always has to live up to financial expectations. Here we look at it the other way around—the product is successful when it’s great, and the company becomes great because of that.&#8221; (This mirrored what Musk had told me earlier in the day: &#8220;The moment the person leading a company thinks numbers have value in themselves, the company&#8217;s done. The moment the CFO becomes CEO—it&#8217;s done. Game over.&#8221;) Von Holzhausen went on, saying, &#8220;Another difference is that at other companies, engineering comes first—a design package is prescribed on the designer and they’re told to make it beautiful. At Tesla, design and engineering are assigned equal value, and Elon keeps them opposed to each other.&#8221; Now that von Holzhausen has gotten used to his freedom to be obsessed with the product at Tesla, he says he &#8220;would dread to go back to pre-historic ways.”</p><p>Von Holzhausen&#8217;s first mission at Tesla was to design their Step 2 car—the mid-priced, mid-volume one—that would be called the<strong> Model S</strong>. The Roadster was based on existing design and was a springboard for the company more than a long-term product. The Model S would be Tesla&#8217;s first flagship product, and it was their chance to reinvent the concept of a car, from scratch. Von Holzhausen said, &#8220;When we started Model S, it was a clean sheet of paper.&#8221;</p><p>This all sounded uncannily similar to how Steve Jobs had done things at Apple. He obsessed over making &#8220;insanely great products,&#8221; and he never paid attention to what other companies were doing, always coming at things from a clean sheet of paper perspective. When Apple decided to make a phone, they didn&#8217;t try to make a better Blackberry—they asked, &#8220;What should a mobile phone be?&#8221;</p><p>Over time, big industries tend to get flabby and uncreative and risk-averse—and if the right outsider company has the means and creativity to come at the industry with a fresh perspective and rethink the whole thing, there&#8217;s often a huge opportunity there.</p><p>When the iPhone came out, it turned the phone industry on its head. So should we be surprised that when the Tesla Model S came out, Consumer Reports <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/04/consumer-reports-10-top-picks-of-2015/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anointed it</a> the best car that had ever been made with an unheard of 99/100 rating, and that Tesla owners are <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/In-Gear/2014/1205/Tesla-Model-S-leads-the-pack-in-customer-satisfaction.-Again.\" target=\"_blank\">across-the-board</a> obsessed with the car? No, because it&#8217;s like the iPhone—it&#8217;s a 15-year leap into the future.<a href=\"#footnote2-32-3667\" id=\"note2-32-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3830\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg\" alt=\"6667\" width=\"600\" height=\"367\" /></a></p><p>The Model S is the fastest 4-door sedan in history, with 3.2-second 0-60 time. It saves battery power by being insanely aerodynamic with the industry&#8217;s lowest drag coefficient (.24). A bunch of engineering innovations have combined to give it the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/tesla-model-s-highest-safety-rating/\" target=\"_blank\">highest NHTSA safety rating</a> of any car ever tested by the US government, 5.4 stars.</p><p>The Model S is already <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=EJmhpgW0Dmc\" target=\"_blank\">driving itself</a> and soon, it&#8217;ll be able to drive itself to meet you out in the driveway in the morning with the temperature already set and the right music on; at night, you&#8217;ll be able to pull up to the house and just get out of the car and the car will park itself into the garage and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2894345/Tesla-teases-electric-car-plugs-charge-Elon-Musk-describes-metal-snake-automatically-connects-vehicles.html\" target=\"_blank\">plug itself in</a>. They did away with model years (i.e. the 2014 Toyota Camry, the 2015 Toyota Camry, etc.), so instead of holding all the year&#8217;s new features until the new release, they just put features in as they go. Someone who buys a Tesla today might have a slightly different car than someone who bought one two weeks ago. And they&#8217;re constantly rolling out fixes and new features through automatic wifi software updates—owners often wake up in the morning to discover the car has a new capability.</p><p>In a bunch of cases, Tesla has wanted to do something that wasn&#8217;t technically possible with the current world or industry limitations—so they&#8217;d build what they needed to build to change those limitations:</p><p>The Tesla battery is heavy and they wanted to make the body super light to offset some of that weight—so they turned to SpaceX and used its advanced rocket technology to make Tesla the only North American car with an all aluminum body.</p><p>Musk and von Holzhausen&#8217;s<a href=\"#footnote-22-3667\" id=\"note-22-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a> team had spent all this time perfecting the design of the car before it was time to put the door handles on, and they got really used to it that way. When it was time for handles, they didn&#8217;t want to ruin how it was, so they figured out how to make the handles lay <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIU73kK7ZUk\" target=\"_blank\">flush</a> with the door.</p><p>They didn&#8217;t like the dealership model and wanted to sell directly to customers, but many states don&#8217;t allow that, so one by one, they&#8217;re <a href=\"http://my.teslamotors.com/fr_CH/forum/forums/where-can-tesla-sell-cars\" target=\"_blank\">fighting</a> the states that won&#8217;t and slowly overturning direct car sales bans.</p><p>They wanted to get rid of buttons altogether and have all controls on a huge, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVsHEZivqm8\" target=\"_blank\">17&#8243; touchscreen</a>—but when their first car came out, there was no iPad yet, and 17&#8243; touchscreens suitable for a car didn&#8217;t exist. So they built their own.<a href=\"#footnote2-33-3667\" id=\"note2-33-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">33</a><p>Innovations like these helped make the Tesla a standout car, but there were still questions around the major shortcomings of EV cars. Of the three EV concerns we listed earlier, AC Propulsion had made significant headway on two—performance and battery range—and the Tesla team had picked it up from there and had continued to improve both. Performance was now the best in the world for a sedan and the battery range—between 208 and 270 miles per charge, depending on the model—was excellent.</p><p>But there were still two problematic questions that needed to be addressed:</p><p>Can you take a road trip? And can anyone afford the car? Tesla is working on both.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How Tesla is solving the road trip problem:</strong></span></p><p>With a 200+ range, the Tesla battery has plenty of juice to get most people through the day on any normal day. Even a busy day of commuting and errands and exploration rarely gets close to 200 miles driving. But on long city-to-city drives or road trips, EVs have always had an issue. So Musk came up with a solution:</p><p>Build a worldwide energy network. Tesla came up with the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/tesla-motors-supercharger-event\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharger</a>—a high-caliber, on-the-road charger—and there would be public stations that would contain a whole row of Superchargers, just like a row of gas pumps at a gas station. A normal garage charger takes either 5 or 10 hours to fully charge the Model S battery, depending on which type of in-car charging system you opted for. Clearly no one wants to stop for multiple hours while on the road to accomplish what a gas car can by stopping for five minutes—so the Supercharger goes much faster. It can charge a Model S at a rate that gives it about 60 miles of range for every 10 minutes of charging time. So if you&#8217;re driving between Boston and New York (215 miles), you might make it with no stopping, but if you did need to stop, you could just charge up for 5 or 10 minutes—not that much more than a stop for gas. Driving from LA to San Francisco (382 miles), you&#8217;d need to stop for 20 or 30 minutes.</p><p>And the thing is—on a 4-hour drive from Boston to New York, isn&#8217;t a 5-10 minute stop desirable anyway? On a 6-7 hour drive from LA to SF, wouldn&#8217;t most people stop for 20-30 minutes to get some food and go to the bathroom anyway?</p><p>The more I thought about this, the more I realized how little of an issue range is for an EV with a good battery like the Tesla. Just say you do a long drive five days a year. That means on 360 of the 365 days, you have to do nothing. You just drive, and <em>you never need to stop at a gas station.</em> And the other five days? You&#8217;d probably just need to stop for about as long as you would stop on a long drive anyway.</p><p>Seems like a perfect solution, but you need to have a Supercharger along <em>your </em>drive if it&#8217;s going to work. Here&#8217;s where Superchargers are today in the US:<a href=\"#footnote2-34-3667\" id=\"note2-34-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">34</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3742\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg\" alt=\"Supercharger US 14\" width=\"600\" height=\"286\" /></a></p><p>And they&#8217;re building them at a furious pace—here&#8217;s where they&#8217;ll be by the end of 2016:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3820\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"Supercharger-US-16-compressor\" width=\"600\" height=\"284\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Europe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Europe</a> and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Asia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Asia</a> will be equally well-covered.</p><p>For now, only Teslas can use the Supercharger stations, and only the Tesla can really make long-distance drives right now anyway. But down the road, Musk plans to partner with other EV car companies so any EV can stop at one.</p><p>A couple other things about Superchargers: they&#8217;re all free to use, and soon, they&#8217;ll all be entirely solar-powered. Musk jokes that if there&#8217;s a zombie apocalypse, Tesla owners will be fine because they won&#8217;t need the grid to fuel their car. And it means that if you had friends to stay with, you could technically drive across the US without taking a wallet.</p><p>This is also going to become even easier with time, because Tesla is making new innovations every year. For example, the Roadster now has a 350 mile range battery and you can just about do LA to SF without stopping—it&#8217;s only a matter of time before their cheaper cars have a similar range. Tesla also recently <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/battery-swap-event\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled</a> a new Supercharger feature—<strong>the battery swap</strong>. A Tesla driver will be able to pull up to a little rectangle and stop the car. The ground opens up and a machine comes out and takes the car&#8217;s battery off, brings up a fresh battery and puts it on, and you&#8217;re good to go—<em>all in 90 seconds</em>. This would cost $60-80, or as much as an expensive tank of gas—so Tesla drivers would now have the option of &#8220;fast or free.&#8221;</p><p>So with that problem very close to being out of the way, Tesla seems to only have one issue left:</p><p><em>Who the hell can afford a $75,000 car? </em></p><p>The starting price of a Tesla Model S is technically $69,900. But if you want the higher-range cars and the faster charging battery, the price jumps up. There are a bunch of other &#8220;well shit now that you mention it yeah I do want that too&#8221; features, and a Model S can quickly work its way toward the $100,000 mark.</p><p>Musk is always quick to point out that for the moment, the US offers a $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV of sufficient range. He also points out what I mentioned above about the $2,000-ish a year gas savings. Sure—but even subtracting all that, we&#8217;re around $55,000 for a Tesla Model S, which is prohibitive for most people. Tesla has a new car coming out soon—their SUV with <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx\" target=\"_blank\">Falcon Wing doors</a>, called the Model X—but it&#8217;s another Step 2, mid-price / mid-volume expensive car. Doesn&#8217;t solve the pricing problem.</p><p>It&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089555_electric-car-market-share-in-2013-understanding-the-numbers-better\" target=\"_blank\">rule of thumb</a> in the car world that every $5,000 decrease in car price approximately doubles the number of buyers who can afford the car. So if Tesla can somehow come out with a stellar EV for about $35,000 less than the Model S, it would double the buyer pool 7 times, or multiply it by 125-fold. Which would now mean <em>most</em> people could afford it. Let&#8217;s bring back Tesla&#8217;s Hershey&#8217;s Kiss business plan from earlier:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3792\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png\" alt=\"pyramid2\" width=\"550\" height=\"414\" /></a></p><p>So Step 3 is what this is all about. Step 3 is why Tesla exists and if Tesla ends up changing the world, it&#8217;ll be because of Step 3.</p><p>That car is the Model 3, and it&#8217;s coming out in 2017. Supposedly. And it&#8217;ll cost $35,000—$27,500 after the tax credit, and after taking gas savings into account, under $20,000. Supposedly.</p><p>But <em>how? </em>Right now, the Model 3 battery costs around $20,000. Even if Tesla ditches the high-tech aluminum body, makes the car smaller, and ditches some of the fanciest things about the Model S, the battery pack alone makes a price like $35,000 impossible.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How Tesla is solving the high-price problem:</strong></span></p><p>Big problems call for big solutions. To solve the range problem, Tesla is building a worldwide energy network of Superchargers. And to solve the price problem, they&#8217;re building this:<a href=\"#footnote2-35-3667\" id=\"note2-35-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">35</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3821\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"hero-compressor\" width=\"800\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s what Musk has named the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/gigafactory\" target=\"_blank\">Gigafactory</a>. It&#8217;s a $5 billion lithium-ion battery factory, currently being built in Nevada. The factory will be self-sufficient, powered entirely by on-site solar, wind, and geothermal energy, and it will employ 6,500 people.</p><p>Right now, the world&#8217;s combined annual output of lithium-ion batteries is 30GWh—mostly for use in laptops and mobile phones. The Gigafactory will make more than that each year, which means it will <em>more than double the total lithium-ion batteries made each year globally</em>. There are two huge benefits to doing this:</p><p>First, Tesla is planning to ramp up production of their cars until they&#8217;re producing 500,000 of them a year, and they&#8217;re going to need a lot of lithium-ion batteries when they do. Musk&#8217;s reasoning is simple: “I know we can’t get enough lithium-ion batteries unless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is building this thing.” The numbers make this necessity clear. To  make enough batteries for their planned 500,000 cars a year, Tesla will need about 30GWh of lithium-ion batteries a year—the current world output—meaning that without building the Gigafactory, they&#8217;d have to use every single lithium-ion battery in the world. Tesla&#8217;s Gigafactory will just barely cover Tesla&#8217;s needs—if a day comes when every car company is making a ton of EVs, there will need to be many Gigafactories built by many companies.</p><p>Second, by both doubling the world supply of lithium-ion batteries and by continuing to innovate with battery technology, Tesla&#8217;s work at the Gigafactory will make batteries a lot cheaper. Musk says the price of the battery should go down by <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/05/14/the-logic-of-teslas-gigafactory-the-economics-are-a-no-brainer/\" target=\"_blank\">at least 30%</a>. Right now, Musk says Tesla could make their cars with a <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/26/elon-musk-says-500-mile-ev-happen-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">500 mile range</a>—they don&#8217;t do it because it would increase the cost of the car. But as battery prices go down, EV ranges will go up as well.</p><p>I&#8217;m pretty convinced that the Model S is the best expensive car ever made. In its first year, its sales blew away its well-known direct competitors—the S-Class Mercedes, BMW 7-Series, the Lexus LS, and the Audi A8—and it&#8217;s been in the lead ever since. But those cars all play in a small space for the very rich.</p><p>It&#8217;s the Model 3 that will turn the industry on its head. You may not know much about Tesla today—or particularly care—but I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone will know about the Model 3 soon. Maybe that&#8217;s why Musk refuses to do any advertising—because he knows that when the Model 3 comes out, he won&#8217;t have to.</p><p>The market has taken notice. Tesla&#8217;s $226 million IPO in June of 2010 marks the first IPO for an American car company since Ford went public in 1956. Since then, the company&#8217;s value has soared upwards. Today, seven years after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Tesla&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:TSLA\" target=\"_blank\">market cap</a> is a massive $31 billion. To put in perspective how big a deal that is, I set Tesla&#8217;s path to that number down on a graph with the Big Three US automakers (just using straight lines to simplify):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3829\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg\" alt=\"Car Graphs\" width=\"638\" height=\"399\" /></a></p><p>The car industry forest canopy has been pretty stagnant for a long time, and for decades, no hungry underdog has been able to make a run at it. Tesla hasn&#8217;t cracked the canopy yet, but for the first time in a long time, there&#8217;s a new company bolting upwards from the ground at lightning speed.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>A Ripple Effect</strong></span></p><p>If you&#8217;re another one of the big car companies, and you&#8217;ve been around for decades, and you&#8217;re comfortably doing your thing, making slight incremental improvements each year to your existing line of cars—could <em>anything in the world</em> be more annoying than Tesla?</p><p>Remember, the car companies know alllll about electric cars and their benefits. Most of them made an electric car in the 1990s when California mandated that they do, and then the second the mandate went away, they confiscated and literally <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F\" target=\"_blank\">crushed</a> the cars. Then they whipped the cars into the dump and covered the pile with a tablecloth with a &#8220;nothing to see here folks&#8221; look on their faces. The scare was over and they could go back to their comfort zone, incrementally improving their gas vehicles.</p><p>Their feelings on EVs make perfect sense:</p><p>Dealerships make a huge amount of profit fixing gas engines, oil filters, and doing oil changes—money they&#8217;d stop making when they sold EVs with motors that rarely broke.</p><p>The car companies already know gas cars back and forth, and they&#8217;ve mastered the art of making a few tiny new changes to them each year so the new year&#8217;s models will be a little better than the previous year&#8217;s. But EVs are a new world for them, and they don&#8217;t know any more about how to make a good powertrain or improve battery energy density than Tesla does—in fact, they know less, as evidenced by Toyota and Mercedes both buying the Tesla powertrain for their EVs. What a pain in the ass all that R&amp;D would be.</p><p>Most importantly, the world already wants to buy gas cars. There&#8217;s no convincing needed—just a few standard TV ads to hone the latest phase of the brand&#8217;s image and inform customers about the latest product updates. But EVs are new and scary to customers, and there&#8217;s a hump to get over in educating the world about why they should buy one. But the <em>really </em>problematic thing about this is that in order to market an EV well, you need to do what I&#8217;m doing in this post and explain all the reasons EVs are obviously a huge step forward from gas cars—which simultaneously sends the message, &#8220;Gas cars are dirty, inconvenient, and old-fashioned.&#8221; Not a thing you want to do when your current bread and butter is selling 10 million gas cars a year.</p><p>And who wants to deal with all of these things when they could just skip it <i>if Tesla would just go away.</i></p><p>Franz von Holzhausen has worked at three of these other companies. The way he sees it, &#8220;they’re trapped in their manufacturing legacy process, trapped in gas engines being their bread and butter, trapped in their dealership model, trapped in their own history.&#8221;</p><p>Musk explains it as a lack of guts and originality: “The big car companies are so derivative. They want to see it work somewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward.”<a href=\"#footnote2-36-3667\" id=\"note2-36-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">36</a><p>But the Tesla tree is racing upwards, and its impending burst through the canopy has successfully scared the industry. We know this for sure, because when the first Tesla Roadster shipped in 2008, there were <em>no </em>big company EVs on the market. Today, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Mitsubishi, and Smart <em>all </em><a href=\"http://www.plugincars.com/cars\" target=\"_blank\">have an EV</a> on the road. Not a coincidence.</p><p>So what&#8217;s the deal with all of these other EVs?</p><p>Most notable is the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/nissan-leaf\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan Leaf</a>, introduced in 2010, which has been the highest-selling EV in the world in recent years (though the much more expensive Tesla Model S has topped the industry in EVs sold <a href=\"http://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/\" target=\"_blank\">so far in 2015</a>). The Leaf costs about $30,000 ($22,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 84 miles. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has for a while been one of the few strongly pro-EV voices in the car industry outside of Tesla.

It costs $43,000 ($35,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 81 miles. BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer has jumped on the EV train, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578635543525172364\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a>, &#8220;You have to look into the future, 10, 15, 20 years…cars like the BMW i3 are a must.&#8221;</p><p>No other EV has had significant sales yet.<a href=\"#footnote-23-3667\" id=\"note-23-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a> I asked Musk about the Leaf and the i3. About the Leaf, he said, &#8220;The range is too low, but if they keep iterating on that, they’ll eventually get there.&#8221; On the i3: &#8220;They&#8217;re trying to do something there. The range is low, but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction, and if they keep going, they’ll get something there.&#8221;</p><p>This &#8220;Congrats on your first big boy toilet poop, Johnny, now next time try to get the whole thing inside the bowl and you&#8217;ll be on your way!&#8221; tone is about as effusive as Musk gets when assessing the industry&#8217;s current attempts at an EV.</p><p>Volkswagen just hired BMW&#8217;s ex-CEO and also <a href=\"http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/\" target=\"_blank\">seems to be</a> bullish on EVs, and GM is promising big things with their upcoming EV, the Chevy Bolt.</p><p>Other car companies still aren&#8217;t convinced. Mercedes CEO Dieter Zetsche <a href=\"http://ecomento.com/2015/04/02/mercedes-ceo-dieter-zetsche-looks-at-the-electric-car-future/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he doesn&#8217;t expect EVs to sell well for a while, because &#8220;the customer gets a car with less range, longer refueling times, somewhat less space, and a higher price tag.&#8221; The major Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, are both skeptical about EVs and have been pouring their future into hybrids and hydrogen cars instead. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne is so anti-EV that he&#8217;s told the world <em>not </em>to buy their Fiat 500e EV, saying they&#8217;re only selling it because regulations have forced them to.</p><p>If EVs are the dominant car of the future, they have a long way to go to get there. As of January 2015, there were a total of <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/28/ev-demand-growing-global-market-hits-740000-units/\" target=\"_blank\">740,000</a> EVs on the road worldwide. Compare that to the whole picture of over 80 million cars sold worldwide annually and over a billion total cars on the road. EVs make up only a fraction of a percent of the car industry. But they&#8217;re on the move:<a href=\"#footnote2-37-3667\" id=\"note2-37-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">37</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3710 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png\" alt=\"ev-fleet-count\" width=\"532\" height=\"352\" /></a></p><p>So we&#8217;re either at the cusp of a new EV-dominated car era or in the middle of another little EV bubble before they vanish from existence <em>again</em>—and as you can see from the quotes above, the car industry is currently divided in which way they&#8217;re betting.</p><p>I think we&#8217;ll learn a lot more soon, because the world is still yet to see its first true potential EV disruptor. The issue with Tesla right now is most people can&#8217;t afford one, and the issue with <em>every </em>other EV is the range sucks. It looks like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3775\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png\" alt=\"Plot\" width=\"500\" height=\"471\" /></a></p><p>The truth is, the typical American drives <a href=\"http://www.facethefactsusa.org/facts/the-asphalts-getting-crowded-video-\" target=\"_blank\">37 miles a day</a> on average, and the 80+ mile range options are probably actually plenty for most people. But 80 miles seems like an insufficient range to prospective buyers, and mass adoption won&#8217;t happen with that kind of range.</p><p>Tesla&#8217;s plan all along was to plant a stellar car right in that Quadrant 4 box, and that&#8217;s what they say they&#8217;re going to do in 2017 when the Model 3 comes out. A number of other carmakers, including <a href=\"http://www.leftlanenews.com/nissan-leaf-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan</a>, <a href=\"http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/\" target=\"_blank\">Volkswagen</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/01/14/what-mary-barras-growth-strategy-says-about-the-new-gm/\" target=\"_blank\">GM</a> have all declared their intention to release a not-that-expensive long-range EV soon. It&#8217;s not clear if any or all of these companies will get into Quadrant 4, but if they do&#8230;</p><p>If there are high-quality, affordable EVs for sale that also have a high range&#8230;</p><p><strong>I cannot think of <em>one </em>reason <em>anyone </em>would <em>ever </em>buy a gas car again.</strong></p><p>A Tesla-quality car that&#8217;s affordable to the middle class would seem to have only pros in the Pro/Con list:</p><p><strong>Pros of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Drives better. </strong>The instant torque of an EV is like exploding out of a gun. There&#8217;s no lag time between your foot touching the pedal and the car moving. Without gears, it accelerates perfectly smoothly. The handling is incredible. It&#8217;s silent.</li><li><strong>More convenient. </strong>No stops for gas. Much less need to take the car in for maintenance. No oil changes. More storage because with no engine, the hood is now the frunk (the front trunk).</li><li><strong>Safer. </strong>With no engine, the entire front of the car becomes a crumple zone. That&#8217;s part of why the Model S has blown away the safety ratings.</li><li><strong>Cheaper. </strong>No gas or oil, and less maintenance. No longer beholden to fluctuating gas prices.</li><li><strong>Healthier. </strong>No smog in cities, which cause <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/dangers-smog-what-you-need-know-about-air-pollution#2\" target=\"_blank\">many, many health problems.</a></li><li><strong>Oh yeah, and the whole thing about avoiding an environmental, economic, or geopolitical catastrophe.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p><ul><li>People who love to shift the manual stick around with all their muscle because they&#8217;re a cool cat on the open road to destiny can&#8217;t do that.</li><li>Five days a year, when you&#8217;re on a long drive, you have to stop for 30 minutes every three hours instead of five minutes every four hours—a con that becomes moot if you would have stopped for 30 minutes anyway every few hours.</li></ul><p>EVs aren&#8217;t there yet. Right now, there are legit cons. But as the next few years pass, EVs will get cheaper, battery ranges will get longer and longer, Superchargers will pop up more and more until they&#8217;re everywhere, and charging times will just decrease as technology advances. Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, and I&#8217;m sure a bunch of seething commenters will try to make that very clear to me, but it seems like a given to me: the gas era is over and EVs are the obvious, <em>obvious </em>future.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>An Angry Giant</strong></span></p><p>The car companies, as I mentioned, aren&#8217;t happy about all of this—they&#8217;re acting like a kid with a cupcake whose parents are forcing them to eat their vegetables.</p><p>But how about the oil industry?</p><p>Unlike car companies, the oil industry can&#8217;t suck it up, get on the EV train, and after an unpleasant hump, continue to thrive. If EVs catch on in a serious way and end up being the ubiquitous type of car, oil companies are ruined. 45% of all the world&#8217;s extracted oil is used for transportation, but in the developed world, it&#8217;s much higher—in the US, 71% of extracted oil is used for transportation, and most of that is for cars.</p><p>So if the car industry has a cupcake and its parents are forcing it to eat vegetables, the oil industry has a cupcake but <i>its </i>parents are forcing it to eat <em>razor blades.</em> The car industry will resist the veggies and have a little tantrum before grudgingly giving in—the oil industry will <em>furiously try to gouge the parents&#8217; eyes out in resistance </em>because for him, this is life and death.</p><p>And that&#8217;s how the oil industry sees EVs—horrifying razor blades. And giant industries don&#8217;t just roll over and eat razor blades without a serious fight.</p><p>We&#8217;ve seen this before. Tobacco companies fought tooth and nail to stay alive and strong as long as possible when the tide started to turn against them. And the oil industry itself has been fighting tooth and nail for a while now on another front—the battle to keep people confused about whether global warming is a thing.</p><p>Usually in these cases, the industry clawing for survival knows it&#8217;s on the way out. But in the meantime, they&#8217;re making money, and the longer it takes before the public fully gets the situation, the longer it&#8217;ll be before the public uniformly rejects them, politicians are able to regulate against them, and the money finally stops. Time is very much money in these situations.</p><p>The tactic to stay alive longer is always the same—put out misinformation to create confusion, and make it political so half the country feels like they&#8217;re going against &#8220;their own team&#8221; if they side against the industry.</p><p>The super-clever way they create confusion is by generating the public perception that there&#8217;s a genuine debate among scientists. That&#8217;s how you make a 97% consensus seem like an open question:<a href=\"#footnote2-38-3667\" id=\"note2-38-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">38</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3708\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg\" alt=\"consensus_gap\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\" /></a></p><p>The same tactic was used a few decades ago when 98% of scientists said smoking caused lung cancer, but the tobacco industry convinced the public for a long time that &#8220;scientists disagree&#8221; about whether smoking is harmful. The book <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> details how many of the same pro-smoking &#8220;scientists&#8221; a generation later became the &#8220;global warming isn&#8217;t a thing&#8221; scientists—the actual same <em>people.</em></p><p>When the 1990 California Zero Emissions Mandate forced car companies to make an EV in order to continue selling cars in CA, the oil industry saw it as a small tumor they needed to swiftly nip in the bud before it grew into a serious threat. Soon, a new voice popped up, a grassroots campaign called &#8220;Californians Against Utility Company Abuse&#8221; (CAUCA). The campaign staged protests against the state&#8217;s proposed utility investments in alternative-vehicle support systems. They also mentioned that &#8220;the environmental benefits of electric cars were dubious.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-39-3667\" id=\"note2-39-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">39</a> But as it turns out, CAUCA was created by a PR firm who was hired and funded by the oil industry. Eventually, the mandate was repealed, EVs disappeared, and the tumor was squashed.</p><p>Now, there&#8217;s a new tumor for the oil industry—Elon Musk. Tesla is showing the public directly that EVs are the future and funding the development of technology that&#8217;s making EVs better than anyone thought possible. A government mandate is crushable—obsessed Model S owners are not.</p><p>But again, oil doesn&#8217;t need to avoid an EV future to have a reason to fight—it just needs to <em>delay </em>the EV future for <em>as long as it possibly can. </em>Tesla&#8217;s mission is &#8220;to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.&#8221; Big oil&#8217;s current mission is &#8220;to <em>delay </em>the advent of sustainable transport by making people think EVs aren&#8217;t actually better for the environment than gas cars.&#8221;</p><p>EVs are most definitely better for the environment—so the oil industry reaches for a key tool.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3832\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png\" alt=\"BS 2\" width=\"450\" height=\"322\" /></a></p><p>There are now a bunch of myths floating around. I didn&#8217;t treat them like automatic myths—each time I heard an argument for why EVs are dirty, I dug in and read about it, but each time, there was little basis in fact. Some examples of myths I&#8217;ve seen floating around about EVs or Tesla in particular:</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>EV battery disposal is <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/01/09/electric-car-subsidies-transferring-wealth-from-poor-to-rich/\" target=\"_blank\">hazardous</a>.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>A) Lithium-ion cells used in cars aren&#8217;t especially hazardous and are classified as landfill safe, B) They&#8217;re almost all recycled anyway, and C) They&#8217;ll continue to be recycled, because a used car battery still has a lot of value, either as a stationary battery or in the raw materials themselves.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>Manufacturing a Tesla is much dirtier than manufacturing a Prius or many other gas cars.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>Expensive cars are dirtier to manufacture than cheap ones. Comparing the manufacturing of a Tesla to a Prius is like saying &#8220;Prius&#8217;s are dirty because it&#8217;s dirtier to manufacture a Prius than a golf cart.&#8221; If you compare apples to apples, it&#8217;s no dirtier to make a Tesla than a similarly-priced luxury car.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>EVs are a huge burden on the electric grid.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>The grid is sized for the worst second of the worst day of the worst year—so there&#8217;s usually a lot of excess capacity. You could replace 70% of US gas car miles with EV miles with no changes to the grid. That percentage will also grow even higher as more homes get their power from solar panels.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>The Tesla uses a lot of graphite in their battery, which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-14/teslas-in-california-help-bring-dirty-rain-to-china\" target=\"_blank\">contributes</a> to China&#8217;s pollution problem.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>The logic here is: &#8220;Tesla batteries use graphite; the world&#8217;s biggest source of graphite is in China; China has terrible pollution; therefore, Tesla is partially responsible for China&#8217;s pollution.&#8221; Except when I did some digging, I learned that Tesla uses synthetic graphite made mostly in Japan and Poland, and that the average Model S uses 100kg of it. That 100kg lasts for ten years, so the amount of graphite used to make a Model S is similar to the amount you&#8217;d use if you had a few barbecues a year.</p><p>But there&#8217;s one myth which has been more effective and more pervasive than any of these—<strong>the long tailpipe theory.</strong></p><p>The long tailpipe theory is everywhere. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t like EVs points it out immediately. So what&#8217;s the theory? I&#8217;ll let Fox News&#8217; Greg Gutfeld do the honors:</p><p>&#8220;The entire reason for doing these stupid little cars is a lie because electricity comes from coal. In some cases, some studies show that these can produce more pollution than internal combustion engines.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-40-3667\" id=\"note2-40-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">40</a><p>Upon first examination, this makes sense. Let&#8217;s bring back our US emissions chart to see what Greg means:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3768\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png\" alt=\"US Emissions 2013 2\" width=\"900\" height=\"515\" /></a></p><p>Earlier in the post, we identified the two biggest causes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: cars running on gas and coal making electricity. The long tailpipe theory&#8217;s logic is that all an EV does is shift energy production from the first bad category to the second bad category. Since coal is the most prominent source of electricity in the world, and coal emits about 1.5 times more carbon than oil per joule of energy produced, EVs are actually worse emissions culprits than gas cars.</p><p>When you read about EVs or talk to people about them, you&#8217;ll hear this theory come up <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/17/unplug-the-volt/\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-10/opinion/ct-oped-0810-goldberg-20100810_1_electric-cars-chevy-volt-ev1\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102273164\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/049504_electric_cars_ethanol_greenwashing.html#\" target=\"_blank\">again</a>.</p><p>The thing you&#8217;ll notice, though, is that every time you hear someone all mad about the long tailpipe emissions of EVs, they&#8217;re using wording like, &#8220;may be&#8221; and &#8220;often&#8221; and, in the case of Greg, &#8220;in some cases, some studies show.&#8221; That&#8217;s because you have to use words like that when you&#8217;re saying things that you wish were true but actually aren&#8217;t.</p><p>Taking the US as an example, here&#8217;s why they&#8217;re wrong:</p><p><strong>1) US electricity production is mixed, not just coal. </strong>Coal only makes up 39% of US electricity production. And that number&#8217;s going down:<a href=\"#footnote2-41-3667\" id=\"note2-41-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">41</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3818\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.56.42 PM\" width=\"633\" height=\"302\" /></a></p><p>Natural gas, which emits less than half the CO<sub>2</sub> of coal, now makes up over a quarter of US electricity production. Nuclear and renewables emit almost no CO<sub>2</sub> and now produce a third of US electricity.</p><p><strong>2) Energy production is more efficient in a power plant than it is in a car engine. </strong>To use an example with an identical source fuel, burning natural gas in a power plant is about <a href=\"http://www.npc.org/study_topic_papers/4-dtg-electricefficiency.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">60% efficient</a>, meaning 40% of the energy of the fuel is lost in the energy production process. In a car, burning gas is less than 25% efficient, with the vast majority of the energy lost to heat. The larger more complex system at a power plant will always be far better at capturing waste heat than a tiny car engine. The increased efficiency means that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">even a car running <em>purely </em>on coal-generated electricity will emit carbon at the same rate as a gas car that gets 30 miles per gallon</span>—which would be a significantly cleaner-than-average gas car.</p><p>Because the breakdown of energy source is different in different states, an EV will be greener in some places than others. The US Department of Energy has a <a href=\"http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php\" target=\"_blank\">great tool</a> to assess exactly how an EV stacks up against a gas car in any zip code in the country.</p><p>In the parts of the country that use very little coal, like upstate New York, an EV&#8217;s well-to-wheel emissions are <em>far </em>less than that of a gas car (on the chart, HEV = a traditional hybrid car, PHEV = a plug-in hybrid car):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3724\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.05.59 PM\" width=\"601\" height=\"268\" /></a></p><p>In the heaviest coal states, like Colorado, EVs cause a lot more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions—but still less than a gas car:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3723\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.04.39 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"270\" /></a></p><p>The national average is somewhere in between, putting an EV at 61% of a gas car&#8217;s emissions overall:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3725\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.06.20 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"262\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Union of Concerned Scientists</a><a href=\"#footnote-24-3667\" id=\"note-24-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a> came up with a way to directly compare car emissions, regardless of the type of car it is—a metric called &#8220;miles per gallon equivalent,&#8221; or MPG<sub>ghg</sub> (ghg stands for greenhouse gases).</p><p>MPG<sub>ghg</sub> is how many miles per gallon a gas car would need to achieve in order to match the carbon emissions of an EV (in the EV&#8217;s case, the emissions come from the plant that makes the electricity). In other words, if an EV gets 40 MPG<sub>ghg</sub>, it means it emits the exact same amount of carbon as a gas car that gets 40 MPG.</p><p>The average new gas car gets 23 MPG. Anything above 30 MPG is really good for a gas car, and anything below 15 or 17 is bad. For reference, remember that an EV running on <em>just </em>coal-produced electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg </sub>of 30 (so even in a hypothetical entirely coal-powered state, an EV would be the same as a highly efficient gas car), and an EV running on just natural gas-powered electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg</sub> of 54 and just top the Toyota Prius, which runs at 50 MPG.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a useful map that shows the kind of MPG<sub>ghg</sub> EVs get in different parts of the US:<a href=\"#footnote2-42-3667\" id=\"note2-42-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">42</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3828\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg\" alt=\"MPG Map\" width=\"738\" height=\"822\" /></a></p><p>So even for the 17% of the population living in the worst coal states, an EV beats almost all gas cars. This sums it up:<a href=\"#footnote2-43-3667\" id=\"note2-43-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">43</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3721\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.52.33 PM\" width=\"672\" height=\"197\" /></a></p><p>And the thing is, each year, that already-nicely-positioned blue bar will make a little jump to the right. Because the grid is getting cleaner every year, it means an EV gets cleaner as time goes by. Gas cars are locked where they are, and they&#8217;ll be stuck watching as the future pulls away from them.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>I didn&#8217;t feel strongly about this topic before I spent a lot of recent time learning about it—and now that I have, I kind of think the only way someone could feel positive about a gas car future is if they&#8217;re misinformed, personally financially interested in gas cars, hopelessly old-fashioned, drunk with politics, or kind of just being a dick? Right? They would have to be one of those five things to be super pro-gas car—right?</p><p>The battle going on isn&#8217;t about gas cars vs. electric cars. That one&#8217;s already decided. This is a war about time. Oil companies will try to slow things down, and they may succeed—but they&#8217;re not winning this one. I just don&#8217;t see how they could. A company that makes lantern fuel can stay strong for a while by shielding the public from understanding what a light bulb is, but eventually, people will figure it out and lanterns will be out of business, bringing the lantern fuel company down with it. Greasy hoods are old, noisy acceleration is old, overheating engines are old, oil changes are old, and it won&#8217;t be long before everyone realizes that. A fun field trip in 2050 will be taking your grandkid to see an old 20th-century gas station and explaining how it worked.<a href=\"#footnote-25-3667\" id=\"note-25-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a> Driving a gas car is like littering on a camping trail, smoking on an airplane, and throwing a big stack of paper in the trash, and it&#8217;s just a matter of time until public disgust catches up to it.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Zooming Back Out</strong></span></p><p>Learning to harness the dragon of fire launched our modern world, and still today, we live in the age of burning. But we need to move on—we need to stop plowing through the trust fund and get a job. The dog needs to let the cave go. We need to learn to make energy the adult way—sustainably.</p><p>The sustainable energy world of the future—the yellow zone of our <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\" target=\"_blank\">timeline</a> from earlier in the post—is simple. It looks like this:</p><p><strong>1) Almost everything we use will run on electricity.</strong></p><p><strong>2) Almost all of our electricity will be produced from sustainable sources.</strong></p><p>That&#8217;s a world running on sunlight and electricity, and burning has no part in that world.</p><p>This transition will happen in steps, over time. At the beginning of the post, we identified the two problems we needed to address most urgently: 1) Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty. 2) Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</p><p>We spent the rest of the post zoomed in on Problem 2 to examine how things got that way, stayed that way, and why we may be witnessing the moment it finally changes.</p><p>We won&#8217;t get into Problem 1 today—but both Musk, through the US-leading solar panel installation company he co-founded, <a href=\"http://www.solarcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SolarCity</a>, and Tesla, with their new product, the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall\" target=\"_blank\">Powerwall</a> stationary battery,<a href=\"#footnote-26-3667\" id=\"note-26-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a> are leading the way in this half of the energy equation too. For those interested, I put up a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html\" target=\"_blank\">mini post</a> on solar power and SolarCity.</p><p>People don&#8217;t quite realize it yet, but as of this moment, a family or business has the option to individually move themselves into the sustainable future. Using products made by SolarCity and Tesla alone, you can today live in a home and drive a car that are both powered by a solar panel-connected battery and live entirely on sunlight. Musk and his companies have made a little yellow brick road right out of the Fossil Fuel Era for anyone who wants to leave. And if modern technology can allow individual people, businesses, or even whole cities to live without fossil fuels, it hints that the only era any of us has ever known might be soon coming to an end.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>How to Change the World</strong></span></p><p>A study of Tesla isn&#8217;t about a car or a car company—it&#8217;s about how change happens. And about why it often doesn&#8217;t happen.</p><p>Our intuition tells us that technology, social norms, movements and ideas just move forward through time, as if forward progress is a river and those things are on a raft gliding through. We so associate the passage of time with progress that we use the term &#8220;the future&#8221; to refer to a better, more advanced version of our present world.</p><p>In reality, if a more advanced future does happen, it&#8217;s because that future was <em>willed</em> into our lives by a few brave people. The present isn&#8217;t welcoming of an advanced future because the present is run by a thick canopy made up of the<span class=\"s1\"> ideas, norms, and technologies of the <em>past. </em>There&#8217;ll be incremental tweaks and slight iterations on proven-to-work concepts, which may <em>seem </em>to us like moving into the future, but it&#8217;s really just a polishing up of the past.</span></p><p>When the real change arrives, you know you&#8217;re seeing it. <span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s a distinct and exhilarating feeling when you witness a disrupting innovator ram its way through the canopy. I had that feeling when I watched Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OEsI0Sc_s\" target=\"_blank\">introduce</a> the iPhone in 2007. Before that moment, I had assumed that the ubiquitous Blackberrys and Nokias and Razors of the world were cutting-edge technology—but that keynote was an epiphany about how buried in the past those phones actually were. You don&#8217;t realize your Blackberry sucks until the iPhone exists. The feeling I had watching that keynote is the same feeling I had when I was six and I saw someone type on a computer word processor for the first time, and the last word on the line would magically jump to the line below when it hit the edge. Typewriters, which had seemed normal that morning, were suddenly ancient. The same thing happened when I saw the first iPod and became instantly disgusted with my horribly clunky and inefficient big booklet of CDs.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I had this feeling again, last month, when I test drove a Tesla Model S. I had driven to the Tesla factory that morning in what had felt like a brand new rental car, and I left the factory in the same car, now feeling like a 1982 model. I get now why Matthew Inman <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s\" target=\"_blank\">calls</a> his Model S a &#8220;magical space car&#8221;—because that&#8217;s how it felt. That&#8217;s how a new, revolutionary technology always feels. Our modern world became as advanced as it is not by floating up an inevitable advancement river, but because of a collection of moments over time when a person or company has done something that makes everyone&#8217;s jaw drop.</span></p><p>But those world-changing moments don&#8217;t just smoothly glide into the world: these leaps into the future usually have to <span class=\"s1\"><em>jam </em>themselves through the canopy and then battle to keep themselves there. The past, which likes to loiter casually in our present world, hates when a piece of the future bursts onto the scene, because that exposes the past for being what it really is—the past. So a new and disruptive technology is often met with hostility as it emerges, as the existing canopy does whatever it can to squash the potential disruptor out of existence before it can gain momentum and start to spread. The old guard knows that once a disruptor gets a foothold and starts quickly spreading its ideas, the entire game changes—and once that balance tips, now instead of trying to squash the disruptor, everyone has to scramble </span><span class=\"s1\">to try to <em>emulate</em> it.</span></p><p>What Tesla is doing right now is an up-close example of how that kind of change happens.</p><p>The idea to change the car industry started as brainwaves zipping around Elon Musk&#8217;s head, as Christie Nicholson learned the hard way, but Musk couldn&#8217;t do much about it on his own. To make the idea real, he had to <em>scale </em>those brainwaves up, and he did that by building Tesla. That brought a new player into the car industry, run by a collective super-brain made up of 11,000 Tesla employees who also happened to think a lot about electric cars.</p><p>Change doesn&#8217;t happen on a familiar landscape—change has to construct the landscape itself. This is part of the reason the challenges Tesla has taken on are so enormous. Henry Ford didn&#8217;t just build a car—he built a landscape, defining what a car was. Since then, car companies have worked within Ford&#8217;s landscape. Bringing back what Musk said about Ford—<em>He was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn’t know what they needed</em>—it&#8217;s clear that this is exactly what Musk and Tesla are doing right now. If there aren&#8217;t enough charging stations for long-trips, build an energy network of Superchargers. If scalability is held back by the high price of lithium-ion batteries, build a factory that doubles the world supply of them to bring the price down. Just get it done.</p><p>But with a goal as ambitious as &#8220;accelerating the advent of sustainable transport&#8221; and a victory condition as far-reaching as &#8220;half of all new cars being electric,&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote-27-3667\" id=\"note-27-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a> building one great car company isn&#8217;t enough. To bring Musk&#8217;s original idea to the next level, Tesla would need to scale <em>itself</em>. To do that, Tesla is building a line of cars so stellar that it&#8217;s going to change the public&#8217;s expectations of a what a car should be, and the whole industry will have to adjust to that new expectation.</p><p>And by solving so many EV problems for its own cars, it&#8217;s forging the path to an EV-dominated world for all the other companies too. A company trying to rise to the top of their industry would hold their innovation secrets close—but because Tesla&#8217;s goal is to<em> transform</em> the industry, in 2014, Tesla made <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you\" target=\"_blank\">all of their patents</a> available to whomever wanted them.</p><p class=\"p1\">Other companies are critical to the mission, because Tesla&#8217;s goal is to ramp production up to 500,000 cars, which is only around half a percent of the total cars made each year. He explained, &#8220;The impact that Tesla will have is fairly small in and of itself. It will change people’s perception perhaps, but it will not in and of itself change the world. But if large numbers of people are choosing to buy the Model 3, and the car companies see that there’s no excuse left anymore because the car’s long range and the car’s handling and acceleration is better in every way than a gasoline car, and it&#8217;s affordable—and people are pretty sure this is what they want to buy—then that&#8217;s what will prompt car companies to invest real money into electric vehicle programs of their own, and indirectly, by spurring competition, Tesla can be the catalyst for a multi-order of magnitude shift of the entire industry towards electric.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s how to spread the brainwaves of a single person throughout a huge industry and the global public—and by the time it&#8217;s done, everyone will think a lot about electric cars.</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about something, or maybe something unexpected happens—but from what I&#8217;ve seen, read, and talked about, it really seems like Tesla is going to fulfill its mission and change the world. It&#8217;s going to <em>accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. </em>If the Model 3 ends up being as great as they say it&#8217;s gonna be, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that electric cars will be the norm far earlier than they would have been. Which will, in turn, mean that 50 years from now, the atmosphere&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> level will probably be lower than it would have otherwise been, cities will be less smoggy than they would have otherwise been, global temperatures will be lower than they would have otherwise been, the sad polar bear will get to eat seals again, along with about 12 other positive effects that will legitimately affect our lives. Pretty down-the-middle definition of changing the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is what Musk spends <em>two</em> days of his week on. With the rest of his time, he&#8217;s trying to make humanity a multi-planetary species—a goal that makes his Tesla mission seem like starting a grapefruit stand.

When so many particles are gathered in one place like they are in the sun, they squish together unpleasantly until they combine with each other, which is called nuclear fusion, and it&#8217;s an intense process that releases a ton of energy. So to say it boringly, the gravitational potential energy of the sun&#8217;s particles ignites fusion, which generates radiation energy, and that&#8217;s the energy we receive from the sun on Earth.

General Motors actually had made a great electric car in the 90s that customers loved, called the EV1. But GM realized that if the car caught on too much, the California mandate would look like a huge success and other states might decide to do it too. Meanwhile, customers might also decide they all wanted electric cars. None of this would be ideal, considering that GM makes 10 million new cars a year, 99.9% of them run on gas, and it would suck if GM&#8217;s entire inventory was suddenly seen as outdated. So GM and the other companies did their best <em>not </em>to sell their electric cars, to show how little the world wanted them and how big a failure the California mandate was. After using all the muscle they had to shut down the mandate (with the help of the Bush administration, whose Chief of Staff, Andy Card, was CEO of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association previously), car companies whisked the new electric vehicles they had made off the roads. GM, who had only <em>leased</em> the EV1 to customers, demanded each one returned, against the pleading wishes of their lessees, and then had all of them crushed like the mafia offing a bad apple they wanted to make disappear. EV1 lovers staged a <em>funeral</em> for the cars. Not many instances in history when a company has torn a product away from paying customers who cared so much about it they&#8217;d read eulogies about it. The well-made documentary <a href=\"http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Who Killed the Electric Car?</em></a>, made in 2006,<em> </em>tells the whole story (the sequel, <a href=\"http://www.revengeoftheelectriccar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Revenge of the Electric Car</em></a>, made in 2011, tells the story of Tesla and the recent resurgence of the electric vehicle market).<a href=\"#note-12-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-13-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk reportedly did not get laid that night.<a href=\"#note-13-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-14-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Alternating current is the type of current that comes out of your home outlets and it generates power by electrons moving back and forth in a quick vibration in the wire. This is opposed to DC, or direct current, which is the more intuitive type, used with batteries, where electrons flow through a wire in a single direction (since electric cars use batteries, the battery produces direct current, which then has to be converted into alternating current through a box in the car called an inverter). Back in the 1880s, Thomas Edison, who was heavily invested in DC, engaged in a battle with George Westinghouse, who had teamed up with Nikola Tesla to push AC, over the best way to power homes. This was called The War of Currents. Tesla&#8217;s AC won because it could travel over much larger distances without overheating—Edison&#8217;s way would have needed lots of small power stations so that each home was relatively close to one of them, while AC could be produced in a huge power plant and then travel far away through a grid.<a href=\"#note-14-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-15-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Faraday, who discovered induction, was their second choice.<a href=\"#note-15-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-16-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I cued up <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MmQb94EF1UY?t=29m14s\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> to where you can hear Musk call hydrogen cars &#8220;bullshit&#8221; and then go on a little rant about them.<a href=\"#note-16-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-17-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Among many reasons hydrogen cars seem inferior to EVs, here are four:</p><p>1) Hydrogen cars seem beholden to natural gas, a fossil fuel, in order to extract the hydrogen fuel, while electric cars get cleaner over time as electricity production gets cleaner.</p><p>2) When it comes to energy density, driving range, and cost, the best case scenario for hydrogen cells is similar to where EV batteries are now, and EV batteries will get better with time.</p><p>3) Hydrogen is a somewhat dangerous and difficult-to-handle substance that&#8217;s a nightmare compared to the simple wall-outlet electricity EVs use.</p><p>4) Down the road, when the norm is to charge the car up in your garage, it&#8217;s going to seem primitive to have to go to a station to fuel up.</p><p>In an email exchange I had with Musk about hydrogen cars, he explained it like this:</p><p><em>If you take electricity coming from a solar panel and charge a battery, you can get ~90% efficiency. Simple and cheap. Instead, if you use that electricity to split water, separate the hydrogen with extreme purity, pressurize it to crazy levels (or, even worse, liquefy), transfer it to a giant (even in liquid form) hydrogen storage tank in the car and then recombine it with oxygen to generate electricity, you would be lucky to get ~20% efficiency. Expensive, complex, bulky and super inefficient. It loses on every dimension, including refuel time when pack swap is factored in. </em></p><p><em>Cost is bad for fuel cells, but that is only one of many bad dimensions. If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million. They are not.</em></p><p>Finally, if I wasn&#8217;t already convinced, this highly-detailed, fairly devastating <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/04/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-about-not-clean/\" target=\"_blank\">takedown</a> of the argument hydrogen cars left me feeling eternally puzzled about why the Japanese companies would want to go further down that road.<a href=\"#note-17-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-18-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>When you click a footnote next to &#8220;kWh,&#8221; you&#8217;re signing up to learn what a kWh is. Here we go:</p><p>A watt isn&#8217;t a unit of energy, it&#8217;s a <em>rate </em>of energy usage—which is a unit of <em>power</em>. The unit of <em>energy </em>is the joule (which itself is the energy required to move one newton one meter). 1 watt = 1 joule/second. 1 kilowatt is 1,000 joules/second. A megawatt is 1 million joules/second, and a gigawatt is 1 billion joules/second. They&#8217;re units of power.</p><p>But a watt-<em>hour, </em>like a joule, is a unit of <em>energy. </em>It&#8217;s the amount of energy needed to run something at a rate of one watt for one hour. When we talk about car batteries, we don&#8217;t use joules because the numbers would be too big and inconvenient. Instead, we use kWh. 1 kWh = 1,000 joules/second over an entire hour = 3,600,000 joules.<a href=\"#note-18-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-19-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>At the time, they didn&#8217;t own the rights to the name yet—some guy in Sacramento did.<a href=\"#note-19-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-20-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>They were both so sad about this that they still aren&#8217;t on speaking terms today.<a href=\"#note-20-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-21-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk&#8217;s thoughts on the role of CEO: &#8220;The CEO receives the distillation of all the worst problems in the company, only spending time on the things that are going wrong, and you get all the stuff other people can’t take care of, so you have a filter for the crappiest problems in the company.&#8221;<a href=\"#note-21-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-22-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I&#8217;m sick of writing von Holzhausen with the little v and the upsetting spelling and I wish he had a different name.<a href=\"#note-22-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-23-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>In the almost-an-EV world of plug-in hybrids, the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/chevrolet-volt\" target=\"_blank\">Chevy Volt</a> ($35,000, 38 mile range before gas kicks in) and the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/toyota-prius-plugin-hybrid\" target=\"_blank\">Toyota Prius Plug-In</a> ($31,000, 11 mi range before gas) are the clear leaders.<a href=\"#note-23-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-24-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>No one in the world sounds less fun to hang out with than a group of concerned scientists.<a href=\"#note-24-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-25-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCs8B-TlylY\" target=\"_blank\">This Nissan commercial</a> does a good job of hammering home the message.<a href=\"#note-25-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-26-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>You can watch Musk explain everything about the Powerwall <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<a href=\"#note-26-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-27-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk has a bet going with someone that that will happen by 2027.<a href=\"#note-27-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div><div class=\"footnotes2\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote2-1-3667\" class=\"footnote2\"><p>Gray square footnotes are as boring as you&#8217;d think a gray square footnote would be.

Remember in the 1990s, when we would call strangers and give them our credit-card numbers? Elon dreamed up a little thing called PayPal. His Tesla Motors and SolarCity companies are making a clean, renewable-energy future a reality&#8230;his SpaceX [is] reopening space for exploration&#8230;it’s a paradox that Elon is working to improve our planet at the same time he’s building spacecraft to help us leave it.</em></p><p>So no, that was not a phone call I had been expecting.</p><p>A few days later, I found myself in pajama pants, pacing frantically around my apartment, on the phone with Elon Musk. We had a discussion about Tesla, SpaceX, the automotive and aerospace and solar power industries, and he told me what he thought confused people about each of these things. He suggested that if these were topics I&#8217;d be interested in writing about, and it might be helpful, I could come out to California and sit down with him in person for a longer discussion.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3625\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call1.png\" alt=\"2Call1\" width=\"400\" height=\"291\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call21.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3653\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call21.png\" alt=\"2Call2\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" /></a></p><p>For me, this project was one of the biggest no-brainers in history. Not just because Elon Musk is Elon Musk, but because here are two <em>separate </em>items that have been sitting for a while in my &#8220;Future Post Topics&#8221; document, verbatim:</p><p>&#8211; &#8220;electric vs hybrid vs gas cars, deal with tesla, sustainable energy&#8221;</p><p>&#8211; &#8220;spacex, musk, mars?? how learn to do rockets??&#8221;</p><p>I already wanted to write about these topics, for the same reason I <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> Artificial Intelligence—I knew they would be hugely important in the future but that I also didn&#8217;t understand them well enough. And Musk is leading a revolution in both of these worlds.</p><p>It would be like if you had plans to write about the process of throwing lightning bolts and then one day out of the blue Zeus called and asked if you wanted to question him about a lot of stuff.</p><p>So it was on. The plan was that I&#8217;d come out to California, see the Tesla and SpaceX factories, meet with some of the engineers at each company, and have an extended sit down with Musk. <em>Exciting.</em></p><p>The first order of business was to have a full panic. I needed to not sit down with these people—these world-class engineers and rocket scientists—and know almost nothing about anything. I had a lot of quick learning to do.</p><p>The problem with Elon Fucking Musk, though, is that he happens to be involved in <em>all </em>of the following industries:</p><ul><li>Automotive</li><li>Aerospace</li><li>Solar Energy</li><li>Energy Storage</li><li>Satellite</li><li>High-Speed Ground Transportation</li><li>And, um, Multi-Planetary Expansion</li></ul><p>Zeus would have been less stressful.</p><p>So I spent the two weeks leading up to the West Coast visit reading and reading and reading, and it became quickly clear that this was gonna need to be a multi-post series. There&#8217;s a <em>lot </em>to get into.</p><p>We&#8217;ll dive deep into Musk&#8217;s companies and the industries surrounding them in the coming posts, but today, let&#8217;s start by going over exactly who this dude is and why he&#8217;s such a big deal.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3623\" id=\"note-1-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-2-3623\" id=\"note2-2-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><sup>← <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">click these</span></sup></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The Making of Elon Musk</strong></span></p><p><em>Note: There&#8217;s a great biography on Musk coming out May 19th, written by tech writer Ashlee Vance. I was able to get an advance copy, and it&#8217;s been a key source in putting together these posts. I&#8217;m going to keep to a brief overview of his life here—if you want the full story, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062301233/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062301233&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=UMV6CN256IWSDQDR\" target=\"_blank\">get the bio</a>.</em></p><p>Musk was born in 1971 in South Africa. Childhood wasn&#8217;t a great time for him—he had a tough family life and never fit in well at school.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3623\" id=\"note-2-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> But, like you often read in the bios of extraordinary people, he was an avid self-learner early on. His brother Kimbal has said Elon would often read for 10 hours a day—a lot of science fiction and eventually, a lot of non-fiction too. By fourth grade, he was constantly buried in the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica. </i></p><p>One thing you&#8217;ll learn about Musk as you read these posts is that he thinks of humans as computers, which, in their most literal sense, they are. A human&#8217;s hardware is his physical body and brain. His software is the way he learns to think, his value system, his habits, his personality. And learning, for Musk, is simply the process of &#8220;downloading data and algorithms into your brain.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3623\" id=\"note2-3-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> Among his many frustrations with formal classroom learning is the &#8220;ridiculously slow download speed&#8221; of sitting in a classroom while a teacher explains something, and to this day, most of what he knows he&#8217;s learned through reading.</p><p>He became consumed with a second fixation at the age of nine when he got his hands on his first computer, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore VIC-20</a>. It came with five kilobytes of memory and a &#8220;how to program&#8221; guide that was intended to take the user six months to complete. Nine-year-old Elon finished it in three days. At 12, he used his skills to create a video game called Blastar, which he told me was &#8220;a trivial game&#8230;but better than Flappy Bird.&#8221; But in 1983, it was good enough to be sold to a computer magazine for $500 ($1,200 in today&#8217;s money)—not bad for a 12-year-old.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3623\" id=\"note-3-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p>Musk never felt much of a connection to South Africa—he didn&#8217;t fit in with the jockish, white Afrikaner culture, and it was a nightmare country for a potential entrepreneur. He saw Silicon Valley as the Promised Land, and at the age of 17, he left South Africa forever. He started out in Canada, which was an easier place to immigrate to because his mom is a Canadian citizen, and a few years later, used a college transfer to the University of Pennsylvania as a way into the US.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3623\" id=\"note-4-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p>In college, he thought about what he wanted to do with his life, using as his starting point the question, &#8220;What will most affect the future of humanity?&#8221; The answer he came up with was a list of five things: &#8220;the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3623\" id=\"note2-4-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p>He was iffy about how positive the impact of the latter two would be, and though he was optimistic about each of the first three, he never considered at the time that he&#8217;d ever be involved in space exploration. That left the internet and sustainable energy as his options.</p><p>He decided to go with sustainable energy. After finishing college, he enrolled in a Stanford PhD program to study high energy density capacitors, a technology aimed at coming up with a more efficient way than traditional batteries to store energy—which he knew could be key to a sustainable energy future and help accelerate the advent of an electric car industry.</p><p>But two days into the program, he got massive FOMO because it was 1995 and he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t stand to just watch the internet go by—[he] wanted to jump in and make it better.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3623\" id=\"note2-5-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a> So he dropped out and decided to try the internet instead.</p><p>His first move was to go try to get a job at the monster of the 1995 internet, Netscape. The tactic he came up with was to walk into the lobby, uninvited, stand there awkwardly, be too shy to talk to anyone, and walk out.</p><p>Musk bounced back from the unimpressive career beginning by teaming up with his brother Kimbal (who had followed Elon to the US) to start their own company—Zip2. Zip2 was like a primitive combination of Yelp and Google Maps, far before anything like either of those existed. The goal was to get businesses to realize that being in the Yellow Pages would become outdated at some point and that it was a good idea to get themselves into an online directory. The brothers had no money, slept in the office and showered at the YMCA, and Elon, their lead programmer, sat obsessively at his computer working around the clock. In 1995, it was hard to convince businesses that the internet was important—many told them that advertising on the internet sounded like &#8220;the dumbest thing they had ever heard of&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3623\" id=\"note2-6-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a>—but eventually, they began to rack up customers and the company grew. It was the heat of the 90s internet boom, startup companies were being snatched up left and right, and in 1999, Compaq snatched up Zip2 for $307 million. Musk, who was 27, made off with $22 million.</p><p>In what would become a recurring theme for Musk, he finished one venture and immediately dove into a new, harder, more complex one. If he were following the dot-com millionaire rulebook, he&#8217;d have known that what you&#8217;re supposed to do after hitting it big during the 90s boom is either retire off into the sunset of leisure and angel investing, or if you still have ambition, start a new company with someone else&#8217;s money. But Musk doesn&#8217;t tend to follow normal rulebooks, and he plunged three quarters of his net worth into his new idea, an outrageously bold plan to build essentially an online bank—replete with checking, savings, and brokerage accounts—called X.com. This seems less insane now, but in 1999, an internet startup trying to compete with the large banks was unheard of.</p><p>In the same building that X.com worked out of was another internet finance company called Confinity, founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin. One of X.com&#8217;s many features was an easy money-transfer service, and later, Confinity would develop a similar service. Both companies began to notice a strong demand for their money-transfer service, which put the two companies in sudden furious competition with each other, and they finally decided to just merge into what we know today as PayPal.</p><p>This brought together a lot of egos and conflicting opinions—Musk was now joined by Peter Thiel and a bunch of other now-super-successful internet guys—and despite the company growing rapidly, things inside the office did not go smoothly. The conflicts boiled over in late 2000, and when Musk was on a half fundraising trip / half honeymoon (with his first wife Justine), the anti-Musk crowd staged a coup and replaced him as CEO with Thiel. Musk handled this surprisingly well, and to this day, he says he doesn&#8217;t agree with that decision but he understands why they did it. He stayed on the team in a senior role, continued investing in the company, and played an instrumental role in selling the company to eBay in 2002, for $1.5 billion. Musk, the company&#8217;s largest shareholder, walked away with $180 million (after taxes).<a href=\"#footnote-5-3623\" id=\"note-5-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p>If there was ever a semblance of the normal life rulebook in Musk&#8217;s decision-making, it was at this point in his life—as a beyond-wealthy 31-year-old in 2002—that he dropped the rulebook into the fire for good.</p><p>The subject of what he did over the next 13 years leading up to today is what we&#8217;ll thoroughly explore over the rest of this series. For now, here&#8217;s the short story:</p><p>In 2002, before the sale of PayPal even went through, Musk starting voraciously reading about rocket technology, and later that year, with $100 million, he started one of the most unthinkable and ill-advised ventures of all time: a rocket company called SpaceX, whose stated purpose was to revolutionize the cost of space travel in order to make humans a multi-planetary species by colonizing Mars with at least a million people over the next century.</p><p>Mm hm.</p><p>Then, in 2004, as that &#8220;project&#8221; was just getting going, Musk decided to multi-task by launching the second-most unthinkable and ill-advised venture of all time: an electric car company called Tesla, whose stated purpose was to revolutionize the worldwide car industry by significantly accelerating the advent of a mostly-electric-car world—in order to bring humanity on a huge leap toward a sustainable energy future. Musk funded this one personally as well, pouring in $70 million, despite the tiny fact that the last time a US car startup succeeded was Chrysler in 1925, and the last time someone<em> </em>started a successful <em>electric</em> car startup was never.</p><p>And since why the fuck not, a couple years later, in 2006, he threw in $10 million to found, with his cousins, <em>another </em>company, called SolarCity, whose goal was to revolutionize energy production by creating a large, distributed utility that would install solar panel systems on millions of people&#8217;s homes, dramatically reducing their consumption of fossil fuel-generated electricity and ultimately &#8220;accelerating mass adoption of sustainable energy.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3623\" id=\"note2-7-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p>If you were observing all of this in those four years following the PayPal sale, you&#8217;d think it was a sad story. A delusional internet millionaire, comically in over his head with a slew of impossible projects, doing everything he could to squander his fortune.</p><p>By 2008, this seemed to be playing out, to the letter. SpaceX had figured out how to build rockets, just not rockets that actually worked—it had attempted three launches so far and all three had blown up before reaching orbit. In order to bring in any serious outside investment or payload contracts, SpaceX had to show that they could successfully launch a rocket—but Musk said he had funds left for one and only one more launch. If the fourth launch also failed, SpaceX would be done.</p><p>Meanwhile, up in the Bay Area, Tesla was also in the shit. They had yet to deliver their first car—the Tesla Roadster—to the market, which didn&#8217;t look good to the outside world. Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag made the Tesla Roadster its #1 tech company fail of 2007. This would have been more okay if the global economy hadn&#8217;t suddenly crashed, hitting the automotive industry the absolute hardest and sucking dry any flow of investments into car companies, especially new and unproven ones. And Tesla was running out of money fast.</p><p>During this double implosion of his career, the one thing that held stable and strong in Musk&#8217;s life was his marriage of eight years, if by stable and strong you mean falling apart entirely in a soul-crushing, messy divorce.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the thing—Musk is not a fool, and he hadn&#8217;t built bad companies. He had built very, <em>very </em>good companies. It&#8217;s just that creating a reliable rocket is unfathomably difficult, as is launching a startup car company, and because no one wanted to invest in what seemed to the outside world like overambitious and probably-doomed ventures—especially during a recession—Musk had to rely on his own personal funds. PayPal made him rich, but not rich enough to keep these companies afloat for very long on his own. Without outside money, both SpaceX and Tesla had a short runway. So it&#8217;s not that SpaceX and Tesla were bad—it&#8217;s that they needed more time to succeed, and they were out of time.</p><p>And then, in the most dire hour, everything turned around.</p><p>First, in September of 2008, SpaceX launched their fourth rocket—and their last one if it didn&#8217;t successfully put a payload into orbit—and it succeeded. Perfectly.</p><p>That was enough for NASA to say &#8220;fuck it, let&#8217;s give this Musk guy a try,&#8221; and it took a gamble, offering SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to carry out 12 launches for the agency. Runway extended. SpaceX saved.</p><p><em>The next day,</em> on Christmas Eve 2008, when Musk scrounged up the last money he could manage to keep Tesla going, Tesla&#8217;s investors reluctantly agreed to match his investment. Runway extended. Five months later, things began looking up, and another critical investment came in—$50 million from Daimler. Tesla saved.</p><p>While 2008 hardly marked the end of the bumps in the road for Musk, the overarching story of the next seven years would be the soaring, earthshaking success of Elon Musk and his companies.</p><p>Since their first three failed launches, SpaceX has launched 20 times—all successes. NASA is now a regular client, and one of many, since the innovations at SpaceX have allowed companies to launch things to space for the lowest cost in history. Within those 20 launches have been all kinds of &#8220;firsts&#8221; for a commercial rocket company—to this day, the four entities in history who have managed to launch a spacecraft into orbit and successfully return it to Earth are the US, Russia, China—and SpaceX. SpaceX is currently testing their new spacecraft, which will bring humans to space, and they&#8217;re busy at work on the much larger rocket that will be able to bring 100 people to Mars at once. A recent investment by Google and Fidelity has valued the company at $12 billion.</p><p>Tesla&#8217;s Model S has become a smashing success, blowing away the automotive industry with the highest ever Consumer Reports rating of a 99/100, and the highest safety rating in history from the National Highway Safety Administration, a 5.4/5. Now they&#8217;re getting closer and closer to releasing their true disruptor—the much more affordable Model 3—and the company&#8217;s market cap is just under $30 billion. They&#8217;re also becoming the world&#8217;s most formidable battery company, currently working on their giant Nevada &#8220;Gigafactory,&#8221; which will more than double the world&#8217;s <em>total </em>annual production of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>SolarCity, which went public in 2012, now has a market cap of just under $6 billion and has become the largest installer of solar panels in the US. They&#8217;re now building the country&#8217;s largest solar panel-manufacturing factory in Buffalo, and they&#8217;ll likely be entering into a partnership with Tesla to package their product with Tesla&#8217;s new home battery, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVjW9XdPlhg\" target=\"_blank\">Powerwall</a>.</p><p>And since that&#8217;s not enough, in his spare time, Musk is pushing the development a whole new mode of transport—the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop</a>.</p><p>In a couple of years, when their newest factories are complete, Musk&#8217;s three companies will employ over 30,000 people. After nearly going broke in 2008 and telling a friend that he and his wife may have to &#8220;move into his wife&#8217;s parents&#8217; basement,&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3623\" id=\"note2-8-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a> Musk&#8217;s current net worth <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">clocks in</a> at $12.9 billion.</p><p>All of this has made Musk somewhat of a living legend. In building a successful automotive startup and its worldwide network of Supercharger stations, Musk has been compared to visionary industrialists like Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. The pioneering work of SpaceX on rocket technology has led to comparisons to Howard Hughes, and many have drawn parallels between Musk and Thomas Edison because of the advancements in engineering Musk has been able to achieve across industries. Perhaps most often, he&#8217;s compared to Steve Jobs, for his remarkable ability to disrupt giant, long-stagnant industries with things customers didn&#8217;t even know they wanted. Some believe he&#8217;ll be remembered in a class of his own. Tech writer and Musk biographer Ashlee Vance has suggested that what Musk is building &#8220;has the potential to be much grander than anything Hughes or Jobs produced. Musk has taken industries like aerospace and automotive that America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new and fantastic.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3623\" id=\"note2-9-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/F.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-3657\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/F.jpg\" alt=\"F\" width=\"219\" height=\"148\" /></a>Chris Anderson, who runs TED Talks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUMZTtQU10o\" target=\"_blank\">calls</a> Musk &#8220;the world&#8217;s most remarkable living entrepreneur.&#8221; Others know him as &#8220;the real life Iron Man,&#8221; and not for no reason—Jon Favreau actually sent Robert Downey, Jr. to spend time with Musk in the SpaceX factory prior to filming the first <em>Iron Man</em> movie so he could model his character off of Musk.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3623\" id=\"note2-10-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a> He&#8217;s even <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Musk_Who_Fell_to_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">been on</a> The Simpsons.</p><p>And this is the man I was somehow on the phone with as I frantically paced back and forth in my apartment, in pajama pants.</p><p>On the call, he made it clear that he wasn&#8217;t looking for me to advertise his companies—he only wanted me to help explain what&#8217;s going on in the worlds surrounding those companies and why the things happening with electric cars, sustainable energy production, and aerospace matter so much.</p><p>He seemed particularly bored with people spending time writing about <em>him—</em>he feels there are so many things of critical importance going on in the industries he&#8217;s involved in, and every time someone writes about him, he wishes they were writing about fossil fuel supply or battery advancements or the importance of making humanity multi-planetary (this is especially clear in the intro to the upcoming biography on him, when the author explains how <em>not</em> interested Musk was in having a bio written about him).</p><p>So I&#8217;m sure this first post, whose title is &#8220;Elon Musk: The World&#8217;s Raddest Man,&#8221; will annoy him.</p><p>But I have reasons. To me, there are two worthy areas of exploration in this post series:</p><p><strong>1) To understand why Musk is doing what he&#8217;s doing.</strong> He deeply believes that he&#8217;s taken on the most pressing possible causes to give humanity the best chance of a good future. I want to explore those causes in depth and the reasons he&#8217;s so concerned about them.</p><p><strong>2) To understand why Musk is <em>able to </em>do what he&#8217;s doing. </strong>There are a few people in each generation who dramatically change the world, and those people are worth studying. They do things differently from everyone else—and I think there&#8217;s a lot to learn from them.</p><p>So on my visit to California, I had two goals in mind: to understand as best I could what Musk and his teams were working on so feverishly and why it mattered so much, and to try to gain insight into what it is that makes him so capable of changing the world.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Visiting the Factories</strong></span></p><p>The Tesla Factory (in Northern CA) and the SpaceX Factory (in Southern CA), in addition to both being huge, and rad, have a lot in common.</p><p>Both factories are bright and clean, shiny and painted white, with super high ceilings. Both feel more like laboratories than traditional factories. And in both places, the engineers doing white collar jobs and the technicians doing blue collar jobs are deliberately placed in the same working quarters so they&#8217;ll work closely together and give each other feedback—and Musk believes it&#8217;s crucial for those designing the machines to be around those machines as they&#8217;re being manufactured. And while a traditional factory environment wouldn&#8217;t be ideal for an engineer on a computer and a traditional office environment wouldn&#8217;t be a good workplace for a technician, a clean, futuristic laboratory feels right for both professions. There are almost no closed offices in either factory—everyone is out in the open, exposed to everyone else.</p><p>When I pulled up to the Tesla factory (joined by Andrew), I was first taken by its size—and when I looked it up, I wasn&#8217;t surprised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_buildings_in_the_world\" target=\"_blank\">to see</a> that it has the second largest building footprint (aka base area) in the world.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6427.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3645\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6427.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6427\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" /></a></p><p>The factory was formerly jointly owned by GM and Toyota, who sold it to Tesla in 2010. We started off the day with a full tour of the factory—a sea of red robots making cars and being silly:<a href=\"#footnote-6-3623\" id=\"note-6-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6434.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3646\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6434.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6434\" width=\"700\" height=\"261\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6439.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3647\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6439.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6439\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6444.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3648\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6444.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6444\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p>And other cool things, like a vast section of the factory that just makes the car battery, and another that houses the 20,000 pound rolls of aluminum they slice and press and weld into Teslas.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/130.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3643\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/130.jpg\" alt=\"130\" width=\"600\" height=\"379\" /></a></p><p>And this giant press, which costs $50 million and presses metal with <em>4,500 tons </em>of pressure (the same pressure you&#8217;d get if you stacked 2,500 cars on top of something).</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/142.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3644\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/142.jpg\" alt=\"142\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a></p><p>The Tesla factory is working on upping its output from 30,000 cars/year to 50,000, or about 1,000 per week. They seemed to be pumping out cars incredibly quickly, so I was blown away to learn that Toyota had been on a 1,000 cars per <em>day </em>clip when they inhabited the factory.</p><p>I had a chance to visit the Tesla design studio (no pictures allowed), where there were designers sketching car designs on computer screens and, on the other side of the room, full-size car models made of clay. An actual-size clay version of the upcoming Model 3 was surrounded by specialists sculpting it with tiny instruments and blades, shaving off fractions of a millimeter to examine the way light bounced off the curves. There was also a 3D printer that could quickly &#8220;print&#8221; out a shoe-sized 3D model of a sketched Tesla design so a designer could actually hold their design and look at it from different angles. Deliciously futuristic.</p><p>The next day was the SpaceX factory, which might be even cooler, but the building contains advanced rocket technology, which according to the government is &#8220;weapons technology,&#8221; and apparently random bloggers aren&#8217;t allowed to take pictures of weapons technology.</p><p>Anyway, after the tours, I had a chance to sit down with several senior engineers and designers at both companies. They&#8217;d explain that they were a foremost expert in their field, I&#8217;d explain that I had recently figured out how big the building would be that could hold all humans, and we&#8217;d begin our discussion. I&#8217;d ask them about their work, their thoughts on the company as a whole and the broader industry, and then I&#8217;d ask them about their relationship with Elon and what it was like to work for him. Without exception, they were really nice-seeming, friendly people, who all came off as ridiculously smart but in a non-pretentious way. Musk has said he has a strict &#8220;no assholes&#8221; hiring policy, and I could see that at work in these meetings.</p><p>So what&#8217;s Musk like as a boss?</p><p>Let&#8217;s start by seeing what the internet says—there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-with-Elon-Musk\" target=\"_blank\">Quora thread</a> that poses the question: &#8220;What is it like to work with Elon Musk?&#8221;</p><p>The first answer is from a longtime SpaceX employee who no longer works there, who describes the day that their 3rd launch failed, a devastating blow for the company and for all the people who had worked for years to try to make it work.</p><p>She describes Elon emerging from mission command to address the company and delivering a rousing speech. She refers to Elon&#8217;s &#8220;infinite wisdom&#8221; and says, &#8220;I think most of us would have followed him into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil after that.  It was the most impressive display of leadership that I have ever witnessed.&#8221;</p><p>Right below that answer is another answer, from an anonymous SpaceX engineer, who describes working for Musk like this:</p><p>&#8220;You can always tell when someone&#8217;s left an Elon meeting: they&#8217;re defeated&#8230;nothing you ever do will be good enough so you have to find your own value, not depending on praise to get you through your obviously insufficient 80 hour work weeks.&#8221;</p><p>Reading about Musk online and in Vance&#8217;s book, I was struck by how representative both of these Quora comments were of whole camps of opinion on working for Musk. Doing so seems to bring out a tremendous amount of adoration and a tremendous amount of exasperation, sometimes with a tone of bitterness—and even more oddly, much of the time, you hear both sides of this story expressed by the same person. For example, later in the comment of the effusive Quora commenter comes &#8220;Working with him isn’t a comfortable experience, he is never satisfied with himself so he is never really satisfied with anyone around him&#8230;the challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t.&#8221; And the frustrated anonymous commenter later concedes that the way Elon is &#8220;is understandable&#8221; given the enormity of the task at hand, and that &#8220;it is a great company and I do love it.&#8221;</p><p>My own talks with Musk&#8217;s engineers and designers told a similar story. I was told: &#8220;Elon always wants to know, &#8216;Why are we not going faster?’ He always wants bigger, better, faster&#8221; by the same person who a few minutes later was emphasizing how fair and thoughtful Musk tends to be in handling the terms for a recently fired employee.</p><p>The same person who told me he has &#8220;lots of sleepless nights&#8221; said in the adjacent sentence how happy he is to be at the company and that he hopes to &#8220;never leave.&#8221;</p><p>One senior executive described interacting with Musk like this: “Any conversation’s fairly high stakes because he’ll be very opinionated, and he can go deeper than you expect or are prepared for or deeper than your knowledge goes on a given topic, and it does feel like a high wire act interacting with him, especially when you find yourself in a [gulp] technical disagreement.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote-7-3623\" id=\"note-7-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> The same executive, who had previously worked at a huge tech company, also called Musk &#8220;the most grounded billionaire I&#8217;ve ever worked with.&#8221;</p><p>What I began to understand is that the explanation for both sides of the story—the cult-like adulation right alongside the grudging willingness to endure what sounds like blatant hell—comes down to respect. The people who work for Musk, no matter how they feel about his management style, feel an immense amount of respect—for his intelligence, for his work ethic, for his guts, and for the gravity of the missions he&#8217;s undertaken, missions that make all other potential jobs seem trivial and pointless.</p><p>Many of the people I talked to also alluded to their respect for his integrity. One way this integrity comes through is in his consistency. He&#8217;s been saying the same things in interviews for a decade, often using the same exact phrasing many years apart. He says what he really means, no matter the situation—one employee close to Musk told me that after a press conference or a business negotiation, once in private he&#8217;d ask Musk what his real angle was and what he <em>really </em>thinks. Musk&#8217;s response would always be boring: &#8220;I think exactly what I said.&#8221;</p><p>A few people I spoke with referenced Musk&#8217;s obsession with truth and accuracy. He&#8217;s fine with and even welcoming of negative criticism about him when he believes it&#8217;s accurate, but when the press gets something wrong about him or his companies, he usually can&#8217;t help himself and will engage them and correct their error. He detests vague spin-doctor phrases like &#8220;studies say&#8221; and &#8220;scientists disagree,&#8221; and he refuses to advertise for Tesla, something most startup car companies wouldn&#8217;t think twice about—because he sees advertising as manipulative and dishonest.</p><p>There&#8217;s even an undertone of integrity in Musk&#8217;s tyrannical demands of workers, because while he may be a tyrant, he&#8217;s not a hypocrite. Employees pressured to work 80 hours a week tend to be less bitter about it when at least the CEO is in there working 100.</p><p>Speaking of the CEO, let&#8217;s go have a hamburger with him.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>My Lunch With Elon</strong></span></p><p>It started like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3634\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-1.png\" alt=\"Lunch 1\" width=\"480\" height=\"398\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3635\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\" alt=\"Lunch 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"321\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3636\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-3.png\" alt=\"Lunch 3\" width=\"481\" height=\"382\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-4.png\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3638\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-5.png\" alt=\"Lunch 5\" width=\"479\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3639\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-6.png\" alt=\"Lunch 6\" width=\"481\" height=\"369\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3635\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\" alt=\"Lunch 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"321\" /></a></p><p>After about seven minutes of this, I was able to get out my first question, a smalltalk-y question about how he thought the recent launch had gone (they had attempted an extremely difficult rocket-landing maneuver—more on that in the SpaceX post). His response included the following words: hypersonic, rarefied, densifying, supersonic, Mach 1, Mach 3, Mach 4, Mach 5, vacuum, regimes, thrusters, nitrogen, helium, mass, momentum, ballistic, and boost-back. While this was happening, I was still mostly blacked out from the surreality of the situation, and when I started to come to, I was scared to ask any questions about what he was saying in case he had already explained it while I was unconscious.</p><p>I eventually regained the ability to have adult human conversation, and we began what turned into a highly interesting and engaging two-hour discussion.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3623\" id=\"note-8-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> This guy has a lot on his mind across a <em>lot </em>of topics. In this one lunch alone, we covered electric cars, climate change, artificial intelligence, the Fermi Paradox, consciousness, reusable rockets, colonizing Mars, creating an atmosphere on Mars, voting on Mars, genetic programming, his kids, population decline, physics vs. engineering, Edison vs. Tesla, solar power, a carbon tax, the definition of a company, warping spacetime and how this isn&#8217;t actually something you can do, nanobots in your bloodstream and how this isn&#8217;t actually something you can do, Galileo, Shakespeare, the American forefathers, Henry Ford, Isaac Newton, satellites, and ice ages.</p><p>I&#8217;ll get into the specifics of what he had to say about many of these things in later posts, but some notes for now:</p><p>— He&#8217;s a pretty tall and burly dude. Doesn&#8217;t really come through on camera.</p><p>— He ordered a burger and ate it in either two or three bites over a span of about 15 seconds. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it.</p><p>— <strong>He is very, <em>very </em>concerned about AI.</strong> I quoted him in my <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a> on AI saying that he fears that by working to bring about Superintelligent AI (ASI), we&#8217;re &#8220;summoning the demon,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t know how <em>much</em> he thought about the topic. He cited AI safety as one of the <em>three </em>things he thinks about most—the other two being sustainable energy and becoming a multi-planet species, i.e. Tesla and SpaceX. Musk is a smart motherfucker, and he knows a ton about AI, and his sincere concern about this makes me scared.</p><p>— <strong>The Fermi Paradox also worries him.</strong> In <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">my post</a> on that, I divided Fermi thinkers into two camps—those who think there&#8217;s no other highly intelligent life out there at all because of some Great Filter, and those who believe there must be plenty of intelligent life and that we don&#8217;t see signs of any for some other reason. Musk wasn&#8217;t sure which camp seemed more likely, but he suspects that there may be an upsetting Great Filter situation going on. He thinks the paradox &#8220;just doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8221; and that it &#8220;gets more and more worrying&#8221; the more time that goes by. Considering the possibility that maybe we&#8217;re a rare civilization who made it past the Great Filter through a freak occurrence makes him feel even more conviction about SpaceX&#8217;s mission: &#8220;If we are very rare, we better get to the multi-planet situation <em>fast</em>, because if civilization is tenuous, then we must do whatever we can to ensure that our already-weak probability of surviving is improved dramatically.&#8221; Again, his fear here makes me feel not great.</p><p>— <strong>One topic I disagreed with him on is the nature of consciousness.</strong> I think of consciousness as a smooth <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">spectrum</a>. To me, what we experience as consciousness is just what it feels like to be human-level intelligent. We&#8217;re smarter, and &#8220;more conscious&#8221; than an ape, who is more conscious than a chicken, etc. And an alien much smarter than us would be to us as we are to an ape (or an ant) in every way. We talked about this, and Musk seemed convinced that human-level consciousness is a black-and-white thing—that it&#8217;s like a switch that flips on at some point in the evolutionary process and that no other animals share. He doesn&#8217;t buy the &#8220;ants : humans :: humans : [a much smarter extra-terrestrial]&#8221; thing, believing that humans are weak computers and that something smarter than humans would just be a stronger computer, not something so beyond us we couldn&#8217;t even fathom its existence.</p><p>— <strong>I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming.</strong> He doesn&#8217;t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: &#8220;The whole system is collapsing. You don&#8217;t see someone who&#8217;s 90 years old and it&#8217;s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The <em>whole system</em> is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.&#8221; Now with anyone else—literally <em>anyone</em> else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk <em>fixes shit for humanity.</em> So what did I do?</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>Well&#8230;but isn&#8217;t this important enough to try? Is this something you&#8217;d ever turn your attention to?</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>You&#8217;re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.</p><p><strong>Elon:</strong> You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it&#8217;s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don&#8217;t know.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>I think there&#8217;s a way. You&#8217;ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that&#8217;s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it&#8217;s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>I mean I do think there&#8217;s&#8230;in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That&#8217;s the only way to do it.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>[Nods, then pauses as he looks over my shoulder in a daze] It&#8217;s software.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) It&#8217;s really funny to brashly pressure Elon Musk to take on yet another seemingly-insurmountable task and to act a little disappointed in him that he&#8217;s not currently doing it, when he&#8217;s already doing more for humanity than literally anyone on the planet.</p><p>2) It&#8217;s also super fun to casually brush off the moral issues around genetic programming with &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a way&#8221; and to refer to <em>DNA—</em>literally the smallest and most complex substance ever—as &#8220;just a physical material deep down&#8221; when I have absolutely no idea what I&#8217;m talking about. Because those things will be his problem to figure out, not mine.</p><p>3) I think I&#8217;ve successfully planted the seed. If Musk takes on human genetics 15 years from now and we all end up living to 250 because of it, you all owe me a drink.</p><address style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</address><p>Watching interviews with Musk, you see a lot of people ask him some variation of this question Chris Anderson <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity#t-1088953\" target=\"_blank\">asked him</a> on stage at the 2013 TED conference:</p><p><em>How have you done this?

Can we have some of that secret sauce?</em></p><p>There are a lot of things about Musk that make him so successful, but I do think there&#8217;s a &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; that puts Musk in a different league from even the other renowned billionaires of our time.

I was a <em>procrastinator</em>.</p><p>Except I wasn&#8217;t. High school is full of regular deadlines and short-term projects, and even longterm projects had sub-deadlines that force pacing upon you. There were a <em>few </em>dire moments, but for the most part, I was just doing everything at the last minute because I knew I could probably still do well that way—so why not.</p><p>There was definitely an <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Gratification Monkey</a><a href=\"#footnote-1-3539\" id=\"note-1-3539\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> in my head, but he was cute more than anything.

College is not like high school. The assignments are big, with a lot of time between deadlines, and since you&#8217;re not a child anymore, classes don&#8217;t treat you like one—no one forces you to pace anything. As a Government major, most of my classes involved a couple papers, a midterm, and a final exam over a four-month stretch, which means most of the time, there were no hard deadlines anywhere on the horizon.</p><p>Without deadlines to occupy him, my Panic Monster, who can&#8217;t think too far ahead, began to spend a lot of time in hibernation. My Rational Decision-Maker, who never realized how much he had relied on the Panic Monster, began to have difficulties carrying out his plans.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3561\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading1.png\" alt=\"Reading1\" width=\"600\" height=\"344\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3562\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading2.png\" alt=\"Reading2\" width=\"600\" height=\"244\" /></a></p><p>The more the Panic Monster slept, the more confidence the monkey gained. The Rational Decision-Maker, the only member of the brain who sees the world clearly, was concerned—he knew that college assignments were a lot bigger than high school assignments, and that pacing was no longer something to scoff at, but a critical thing to do.

It almost seemed like the times my RDM was stomping his foot the hardest about getting to work were the exact moments the monkey would feel the most spirited about putting on the headphones and becoming lost for hours in the piano.</p><p>When college ended, thrilled to be done forever with formal education, which was clearly not my thing, I burst out into the world with 1,000 ambitions to do 1,000 things. Just wait till the world saw me. I had everything imaginable to offer except knowledge, skills, and work ethic.</p><p>My RDM had done a lot of thinking about this, and he understood that the monkey had spent college trying to tell him something important—I wanted to be a <em>composer</em>. That was clearly the thing I was most drawn to, and finally, it would become the thing I was <em>supposed </em>to do each day. No more fighting the monkey—he was going to get exactly what he wanted. I had figured out life, and I moved to LA to write movie scores.</p><p>In order to pay my bills, I began tutoring kids after school on their homework or for the SAT, a side job I chose because it wouldn&#8217;t distract me from becoming the next John Williams. It was the perfect setup, I was brimming with excitement about music, and things were starting to move—when the weirdest thing happened. Just when I was sure I had found myself, the monkey began soul searching. When the RDM and I would sit down at the piano to write something—the exact activity the monkey spent college <em>obsessed </em>with—the monkey would throw a fit and refuse to join us. The RDM began to feel helpless, the same way he did in college.</p><p>Meanwhile, the monkey had found a new interest—he had become fixated with my <i>side job</i>. Tutoring was going well, referrals were increasing, and while the RDM would insist that we were already working with too many students, the monkey would accept every new job that came our way. Soon, the monkey started thinking bigger, and without running it by the rest of us, he began hiring my friends to tutor for me. The RDM would wake up eager to dive into composing, but the whole day would end up being spent on phone calls and buried in spreadsheets. The monkey had started a business.</p><p>My brain and I ended up in an unpleasant no-man&#8217;s land. The monkey refused to let us pour ourselves into our music career, and the RDM refused to embrace the monkey&#8217;s new business career. I was doing a lot of things and not giving my all to any of them.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spread-thin.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3563\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spread-thin.png\" alt=\"spread thin\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>It was around then that my best friend Andrew moved to LA. Andrew isn&#8217;t like me. He lives and breathes business, with no interest in pursuing anything in the arts, and ever since I met him when we were five, his monkey has been a tame little bitch who does what he&#8217;s told. After he moved, we started talking about maybe going into business together somehow. My RDM had refused to entertain taking business seriously until then, but the prospect of starting a company with Andrew and actually putting a full effort into it was enticing—and the monkey was clearly into it, so maybe <em>this</em> was the thing I was supposed to be doing all along. I decided to dive in, and building off of what I had started, we founded a new tutoring company together.</p><p>The RDM still wrestled with the decision to put a pause on the music side of things, but the company was growing quickly, being in business with Andrew was a great time—like playing a complex strategy game with your friend—and the RDM finally started to feel okay about becoming totally wrapped up in business.</p><p>Which was the monkey&#8217;s cue to become an avid blogger.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monkey-blog.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3556\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monkey-blog.png\" alt=\"monkey blog\" width=\"629\" height=\"386\" /></a></p><p>I had been casually blogging for a few years at that point, but business taking off was just what the monkey needed to kick his new writing hobby into full gear, and over the next few years, I wrote hundreds of blog posts in my off hours. I went into work every day, and I&#8217;d be engaged while I was there—but instead of doing what an entrepreneur is supposed to do outside of work and keep the wheels turning, mulling over the strategy and allowing the subconscious to drop key epiphanies on you from time to time, I&#8217;d be thinking about what to blog about next.</p><p>In 2013, when Andrew and I decided to start something new, we looked at my monkey, saw how absorbed he always was with his blog, and thought maybe <em>that</em> was the thing I was supposed to be doing this whole time—so we started Wait But Why. Andrew would continue to grow our company while I&#8217;d fully immerse myself in this new project, giving the monkey exactly what he so badly wanted.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What was classic procrastination in college morphed into a bizarre form of insanity once I entered the real world. On a day-to-day, micro level, there was still always an element of the normal &#8220;RDM tries to do something, monkey makes it difficult&#8221; thing, but in a broader, macro sense, it was almost as if I were <em>chasing </em>the monkey. After he defeated me so soundly in college, I wondered if fighting against him in the first place was my mistake. He&#8217;s born from some inner, primal part of me, so wouldn&#8217;t it make sense to pay attention to his inclinations and use <em>them </em>as my guide?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So that&#8217;s what I tried to do—when he&#8217;d be continually drawn to something, I&#8217;d eventually take his lead and build my life around that. But the problem was, he was almost like a mirage—once I&#8217;d get to where he was, he wouldn&#8217;t be there anymore. He&#8217;d be somewhere else. This was confusing—was he there before because he actually wanted to be, or was he just there because it was where the RDM was <em>not</em>? Did he actually have passions of his own, or was he just some elusive evil contrarian inside of me with a mission to hold me back from ever doing anything great with my talents and energies?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last year, I came across a little diagram that I think holds the key to these questions. It&#8217;s called the Eisenhower Matrix:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3577\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Eisenhower Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Eisenhower Matrix places anything you could spend your time doing on two spectrums: one going from the most urgent possible task to the least urgent, the other going from critically important to totally inconsequential—and using these as axes, divides your world into four quadrants.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The matrix was popularized in Stephen Covey&#8217;s famous book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451639619/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1451639619&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=NWOAUWNGA6LU6OH3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a> and is named after President Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower was well-known for being tremendously productive, which Covey credits to his &#8220;first things first&#8221; attitude on how to spend your time. And to Eisenhower, the &#8220;first things&#8221; were always the <em>important </em>ones. He believed you should spend nearly all of your time in Quadrants 1 and 2, and he accomplished this with a simple D-word for each quadrant:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix-Actions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3576\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix-Actions.png\" alt=\"Eisenhower Matrix Actions\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that&#8217;s fantastic for Dwight fucking Eisenhower. But you know what Dwight clearly didn&#8217;t have in his bald head? An all-powerful Instant Gratification Monkey. If he had, he&#8217;d know that a procrastinator&#8217;s matrix looks like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Procrastinators-Matrix1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3582\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Procrastinators-Matrix1.png\" alt=\"Procrastinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you ever want any information on Quadrant 4—directions, places to eat, etc.—just ask a procrastinator. They live there. For a non-procrastinator, Q4 is a happy place to spend time. After a productive day working on important tasks, it feels great to kick back in Q4—and under those circumstances, there&#8217;s a name for Q4: <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Happy Playground</a>. But procrastinators don&#8217;t tend to hang out in Q4 after an efficient day of high-level work—they&#8217;re there far more often than that, against their will, because the monkey has dragged them there, all while the Rational Decision-Maker is <em>begging </em>them to leave. And they have a different name for Q4: <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Dark Playground</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As for Quadrants 1 and 3—the <em>urgent </em>quadrants—most procrastinators will end up there from time to time, usually in a full sweat, with the Panic Monster next to their face screaming. Q1 and Q3 keep the procrastinator off the streets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And then there&#8217;s Quadrant 2. To a procrastinator, Quadrant 2 is a strange and foreign land, far, far away. Kind of like Atlantis, or Narnia. He knows it&#8217;s an important place, and he&#8217;s tried many times to go there, but there&#8217;s a big problem—the monkey is repulsed by it, and the Panic Monster isn&#8217;t concerned with it. And that&#8217;s the deadly combo that defeats the procrastinator every time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reason this is disastrous is that the road to the procrastinator&#8217;s dreams—the road to expanding his horizons, exploring his true potential, and achieving work he&#8217;s truly proud of—runs directly through Quadrant 2. Q1 and Q3 may be where people survive, but Q2 is where people thrive, grow, and blossom.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But if you&#8217;re a procrastinator, you&#8217;re in luck. You have an ace up your sleeve—someone daring and fearless, with bountiful energy and dynamic talent, and someone who can defeat the monkey like stepping on an ant: Future You.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Future You is a procrastinator&#8217;s most important ally—someone who&#8217;s always there and always has your back, no matter what. I know all about this firsthand. Future Tim is an amazing guy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When my alarm goes off and I don&#8217;t want to wake up, I just press the snooze button, which doles out the job of getting out of bed to Future Tim instead. My to-do list has two parts—a short, easy one for me, and a long one, full of all the things I can&#8217;t imagine ever doing, because they&#8217;re so icky-seeming. Future Tim always handles that one, without a complaint. Future Tim also has no problem with even the vilest of social obligations. I was recently invited to attend a feedback-giving session for a three-hour-long play written by someone I barely know—I certainly had no intention of ever doing that, but I would also have felt guilty just saying no, so I explained that I have a busy couple months, but that I&#8217;d be more than happy to join when it happens again this summer, a time when it&#8217;ll be Future Tim&#8217;s problem, not mine.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Future Tim also has a discipline and balance to his lifestyle I could only ever dream of. I&#8217;ve never been much of an exerciser—but Future Tim belongs to a gym and does all the jogging for both of us, and I love how into cooking healthy meals Future Tim is, because I personally don&#8217;t have the time. Future Tim is the kind of guy we all want to be like—I suggest getting to know him yourself, which you can do by buying his books, since he&#8217;s a prolific author.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But the most important role Future Tim plays in my life brings us back to the Eisenhower Matrix. In a convenient stroke of fate, Future Tim happens to spend almost all of his time in the one place I can never seem to get to myself: the all-important Quadrant 2. Future Tim is Quadrant 2&#8217;s warden, and when I make a list of important to-do items and notice that most of them seem to land in Q2, I don&#8217;t have to despair, because I know Future Tim is on top of them. Which is good, considering how dire a situation Past Tim, that useless fuck, has often left me in:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FT1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3569\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FT1.png\" alt=\"FT\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But for all of Future Tim&#8217;s virtues, he has one fatal flaw that kind of ruins everything: he doesn&#8217;t exist.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It turns out that Future You is as much of a mirage as the monkey&#8217;s passion for a hobby. I banked on Future Tim&#8217;s real-world existence for my most important plans, but every time I&#8217;d finally arrive at a time when I thought I would find Future Tim, he was nowhere to be found—the only person there would be stupid Present Tim. That&#8217;s the thing that really sucks about Future You—whenever time finally gets to him, he&#8217;s not Future You anymore, he&#8217;s Present You, and Present You can&#8217;t do the tasks you assigned to Future You because those tasks can only be done by someone without a monkey. You assigned them to Future You in the first place because he doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> a monkey—that was the whole point. So you do what you always do—you re-delegate them to Future You, hoping that next time time catches up with Future You, he actually exists.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is what left me unable, for years, to give life my full effort. The important work to be done usually lives in Q2, a place I had a hard time going to, so I&#8217;d direct the extra energy to a passionate hobby instead. The monkey would get super into these hobbies, because hobbies are, by definition, in Q4—a place the monkey loves to be.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So here&#8217;s what went on when I was supposed to be pursuing a composing career:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Composer-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3575\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Composer-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Composer Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And when I decided to &#8220;follow the monkey&#8217;s lead&#8221; and take on business, I was missing the key point: &#8220;taking on&#8221; business meant making business the thing I was <em>supposed to do</em>, which turned it from a <em>not important </em>task into an <em>important </em>one—moving &#8220;business&#8221; from Q4, the monkey&#8217;s favorite place, to Q2, his least favorite place.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3574\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Business Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fact that I expected the monkey to remain obsessed with business after the switch to Q2 shows how little I understood the monkey. The monkey&#8217;s passion never was music, or business, or blogging—the monkey&#8217;s passion was always Q4.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the thing the monkey <em>really </em>likes about Q4 isn&#8217;t anything about Q4 in particular—it&#8217;s that <em>Quadrant 4 isn&#8217;t Quadrant 1 or 2.</em> The monkey, whose core drive is to do whatever&#8217;s <em>easiest</em>, can&#8217;t stand the &#8220;important&#8221; quadrants, because the important quadrants are where the pressure&#8217;s on—it&#8217;s where there&#8217;s something to prove, where your actions have consequences, where the stakes are high, and where you&#8217;re shooting for the stars, <em>which means you might fail to reach them. </em>No fucking thanks, says the monkey. Writing 300 blog posts while I was supposed to be dreaming up brilliant business growth strategies wasn&#8217;t &#8220;easy&#8221; in the sense that I didn&#8217;t have to work hard to write them—it was easy in that there was nothing at stake. Stakes are really what’s hard for a human.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I started writing posts for Wait But Why, I knew I wanted to write about procrastination. I needed to try to articulate the madness that went on in my head. After assigning that daunting mission to Future Tim for a while, I finally bit the bullet and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">did it</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reaction was overwhelming. In addition to the over 1,300 comments on the two posts, here&#8217;s the breakdown of emails I&#8217;ve received from readers:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pie-chart.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3579\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pie-chart.png\" alt=\"pie chart\" width=\"317\" height=\"370\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There have been <em>thousands </em>of emails. Apparently this whole thing isn&#8217;t just me.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the emails aren&#8217;t quick, &#8220;Hey I liked the procrastination posts bye&#8221; notes—they&#8217;re <em>thorough</em>. And heartfelt. A good number of them mention that the posts made them cry. And they&#8217;re not crying because they were moved by my shitty stick drawings—they&#8217;re crying because <em>they were reading about</em><em> one of the biggest problems in their lives.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The profiles of those who have emailed range wildly, covering all ages, all kinds of professions, and hailing from almost every country in the world. I&#8217;ve heard from a 13-year-old in Pakistan, a middle-aged professor in Argentina, an 80-year-old retired nurse in Mississippi; a German graphic designer, an Australian author, a Ghanaian filmmaker, a Korean entrepreneur. And the PhD students—the hordes of PhD students—doing the ultimate Q2 task.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In one way, these people all have the same exact problem, and the same problem I have—an Instant Gratification Monkey they can&#8217;t control. But I&#8217;ve noticed, after reading every one of their stories, that the extent to which this problem is ruining their lives varies drastically, depending on a few key facts about their particular circumstances. This distinction places the readers who have emailed into three categories:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) The Disastinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disastinators-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3572\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disastinators-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Disastinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of all procrastinators out there, the Disastinators are in the worst shape. A Disastinator is permanently camped out in Quadrant 4, and procrastination is completely destroying their life. A procrastinator usually becomes a Disastinator for one of two reasons:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A) Their monkey has stopped being scared of the Panic Monster and has become all-powerful</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>B) They&#8217;re a normal procrastinator but they&#8217;re in a life situation with no external deadlines or pressure</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Situation A is super-dark, and as I&#8217;ve learned from reader emails, not that uncommon. These people have lost the ability to do almost anything that matters to them and are either in a downward spiral or have given up entirely.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In Situation B, the Disastinator isn&#8217;t a worse procrastinator than any other, it&#8217;s just that their circumstances are a catastrophic match for their personality. The nature of their life and work gives the Panic Monster no reason to wake up at all, and unfortunately, the monkey isn&#8217;t scared of the Self-Loathing Monster.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/self.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3567\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/self.png\" alt=\"self\" width=\"630\" height=\"239\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The outcome is that the Disastinator gets nothing done, ever. Many of the PhD candidates who emailed me fall into this category.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) The Impostinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We haven&#8217;t talked much about Quadrant 3, but it might be the most dangerous quadrant of all, and it&#8217;s where the Impostinator reigns king. The Impostinator&#8217;s life looks like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Impostinators-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3571\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Impostinators-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Impostinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Impostinator <em>seems</em> productive, but she&#8217;s really an imposter—a procrastinator wearing a productive person mask. By spending all of her work time in Q3, she seems busy—she <em>is </em>busy—but she never seems to make much progress on her real goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Impostinators have clever monkeys, and Q3 is the monkey&#8217;s most clever trick. The monkey knows that the RDM, who can be gullible, can be appeased if he spends ample time out of the Q4 Dark Playground. So the Impostinator&#8217;s monkey creates a battle that goes back and forth between Q4 and Q3, and that works because Q3 <em>feels </em>productive to the Impostinator. It relies on one major delusion of the Impostinator—that busy = productive.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So an Impostinator will spend the whole day answering emails, running errands, making phone calls, organizing lists and schedules, participating in meetings, etc. and if she&#8217;s judging herself by time spent out of the Dark Playground, she&#8217;s a smashing success. But at the end of the day, the satisfaction she feels has a hint of emptiness to it, and the Happy Playground is never quite fully happy. She may have deluded herself into thinking she&#8217;s living a productive life, but in her subconscious, she knows she&#8217;s not doing what she&#8217;s supposed to be doing. Her feelings of accomplishment come along with an undercurrent of despair.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In reality, she&#8217;s living in a grand, overarching procrastination, brilliantly crafted by her monkey. Rather than try to win the tug-of-war between doing what matters—the stuff up in Q2—and the Dark Playground, the Impostinator&#8217;s monkey tricks the RDM into fighting on the wrong battlefield, and he lets the RDM &#8220;beat&#8221; him on this battlefield, which leads her to believe she&#8217;s doing a good job.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The other difficulty the Impostinator faces is that sometimes Q3 disguises itself as Q1. A busy Impostinator often believes that the urgent work she&#8217;s consumed with <em>is </em>important, but the problem with that is what Eisenhower himself said best:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span class=\"ft\">What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.</span></em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, <em>Quadrant 1 often does not exist. </em>This isn&#8217;t always the case, but it&#8217;s especially likely to be true for people who have yet to get their career rolling, because usually when your truly important work is also urgent, it means you have something good going on. This creates a catch-22, where the people who most need urgency in order to do things—procrastinators early in their career—are often those with a totally vacant Quadrant 1.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The more time goes on, the more I think that being super busy tends to mean having a packed Q3 (usually mixed in with too much Q4 time). I know that when I&#8217;m in one of those zones where I&#8217;m telling everyone how <i>busy </i>I am and how little time I have for them, it&#8217;s almost always because I&#8217;m overloaded with Q3 bullshit. People who are really on top of their life—really in control—tend to have plenty of space in their schedules. But society smiles upon busy people, the phrase &#8220;I think you have too much time on your hands&#8221; is an insult, and that leaves Impostinators looking—and often feeling—like they&#8217;re doing it right. And while the Impostinator will always feel superior to the Disastinator, the truth is that in terms of real productivity on things that matter, they&#8217;re equal.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The major lesson here is to beware of Quadrant 3. Q3 grabs you by the collar and thrusts you onto a treadmill of <em>reacting </em>to things. It&#8217;s not a place of self control. And if you&#8217;re not careful, Q3 will suck your life away. I know, because I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my life as an Impostinator.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of the many Impostinators who emailed me, the most common professions were artists of some kind or entrepreneurs. In both of those situations, you&#8217;re the boss of your own life, and the important work to do—improving your skills, deepening your network, executing a creative vision—is rarely urgent.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>3) The Successtinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After spending most of my life feeling unable to maximize myself, since starting Wait But Why a year and a half ago, I&#8217;ve written over 250,000 words—the equivalent of 1,000 book pages—and what I&#8217;m doing really <em>matters </em>to me. For the first time, the satisfaction of accomplishment doesn&#8217;t come along with a twinge of guilt or emptiness or despair. I&#8217;ve done it! I&#8217;m a <em>doer. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not quite.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reality is, I haven&#8217;t overcome my monkey problems one ounce more than the Impostinators and Disastinaters who emailed me—the big difference is, I&#8217;ve gotten myself into a situation where I have a big, fat Quadrant 1 in my life. Not a fake Q1 that&#8217;s really Q3 in disguise—but a genuine Q1, and it&#8217;s packed. The intimate relationship a blog has with real, living people—and the pressure that generates—turns a blogger&#8217;s important work into urgent work, as soon as there are enough readers that the Panic Monster takes interest in things.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a procrastinator, this is the opposite of the PhD-type situation, which I described as a catastrophic match for a procrasinator. Writing regularly with an immediate audience is an example of a terrific match for a procrastinator&#8217;s personality, because it puts his Panic Monster in the optimal location—it aligns the Panic Monster with his most important endeavor.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, my monkey is still wreaking havoc over my whole life in any way he can—I pulled a lifespan-reducing all-nighter to finish this post. But there&#8217;s a key distinction between what he&#8217;s doing now and what he was doing during my previous projects. With those other projects, he spent his Q4 time pursuing real, ambitious projects—and he was allowed to do that because the RDM wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what <em>he</em> wanted, and he would question whether the monkey was actually on to something with his distractions. But at least so far, working on Wait But Why is hitting the nail on the head for the RDM, because he&#8217;s actually spending a lot of time above the important line, so he has a <em>conviction </em>about the undertaking he didn&#8217;t previously. Because of this, he&#8217;ll let the monkey tap dance around Q4 and Q3, mainly because he has no power not to, but he <em>won&#8217;t </em>allow the monkey to take on anything <em>serious </em>with his time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have not conquered procrastination, but for the time being, at least, I&#8217;m in the least bad type of procrastinator situation—I&#8217;m a Successtinator.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Successtinators-Matrix1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3578\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Successtinators-Matrix1.png\" alt=\"Successtinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A successtinator has found a solution-ish to his problems, but it&#8217;s not pretty, often not healthy, and usually not sustainable. It&#8217;s a clever duct-taping of a troubled machine to hold it over temporarily.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I received a lot of emails from Successtinators, and the patterns were consistent and resonate with my own current situation. A Successtinator can be happy with his life, but isn&#8217;t usually that happy <em>in </em>his life. And that&#8217;s because being a Successtinator does not make you a success. Someone who does something well professionally at the expense of balance, relationships, and health is not a success. Real success means having both professional life <em>and </em>lifestyle working well and in harmony—and Successtinators are too stressed, too unavailable, and are often completely deprived of Happy Playground time, which is a critical component of a happy life. A Successtinator is also usually limited in his professional possibilities—great work can be done in Q1, but it&#8217;s often more on the <em>maintaining </em>side of things. Q2 is still where most of the professional growth and out-of-the-box thinking takes place, and like all procrastinators, Successtinators rarely set foot in Q2.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are bigger problems in the world than procrastination. Things like poverty, disease, mental illness, and drug addiction all make procrastination seem glaringly like a problem of the privileged—something to suffer over for those whose lives have no real suffering.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But if a skeptic spent a few hours reading through the mound of procrastination-related emails I&#8217;ve received, I think they&#8217;d agree that this is a dire problem in many, many lives. And it doesn&#8217;t just harm the procrastinator—it hurts the people close to the procrastinator, spreading the effect.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It&#8217;s also the world&#8217;s loss. For every Steve Jobs or John Lennon or Hillary Clinton or J.K. Rowling or anyone else whose talents have enhanced our lives, there are thousands of people with just as much potential who never achieve much for the world because they waste away their time in the wrong quadrants.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One way to look at this is that each human life has a certain number of &#8220;time points,&#8221; and it&#8217;s up to you how you &#8220;spend&#8221; them. Consider the difference between someone who spends 30 hours a week in Q2 and someone else who only manages two hours of Q2 time a week. Since Q2 is, for many, where real advancement happens, over the course of their lives, the 30 hour person will accomplish <em>15 times </em>as much in her life as the two hour person. And in reality, the multiplier is probably even larger than 15, since progress builds upon progress and the rate can accelerate (i.e. Steve Jobs wouldn&#8217;t have accomplished 1/15th of what he accomplished if he had put in 1/15th the productive hours—he probably would have accomplished none of it.) The distinction between an ordinary person and an extraordinary person might simply come down to the differences in how they allot their time points.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Clearing away delusion</strong></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we want to improve our time point spending, the first step is learning to see the world through a crystal clear Eisenhower Matrix—which means shaking off all delusion. We need to develop well-thought-out definitions of <em>urgent </em>and <em>important</em>, which will be different for everyone and requires a deep dig into the highly personal question, &#8220;What matters most to me?&#8221;</p><p>Brett McKay <a href=\"http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/23/eisenhower-decision-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> &#8220;important tasks&#8221; as<em> things that contribute to our long-term mission, values, and goals. </em>This is broad and straightforward and a good core sentence to come back to when assessing importance down the road.</p><p>The thought process about what is and isn&#8217;t urgent should revolve around the self-discussion of what&#8217;s most important. Ideally, urgent would <em>not </em>mean, &#8220;The thing grabbing me hardest by the collar&#8221;—it would be defined by what, of the important tasks on your list, <em>would</em> <em>benefit most from happening sooner rather than later.</em> Using this definition, spending time with your kids would certainly qualify as urgent, while under the typical deadline-related definition of urgent, it would qualify as &#8220;not urgent.&#8221; In other words, the order of your priorities is much better off being set by your RDM than your Panic Monster. Wisdom resides in the RDM, and when the mindless Panic Monster calls the shots on what&#8217;s urgent and what&#8217;s not, you take the RDM&#8217;s wisdom out of the game.</p><p>You may also want to gather some hard data on how you&#8217;re currently spending your time points, by logging your hours for the next week and seeing just how many of them fall into each of the four quadrants (you&#8217;ll probably be unpleasantly surprised by the results).</p><h2><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Becoming the boss of your brain</strong></span></h2><p>Once you feel clear on your Eisenhower Matrix and where its various boundaries lie, you&#8217;ll need to do the hard part and gain control over how you spend your time points within it. Which, for a procrastinator, is life&#8217;s greatest challenge.</p><p>The rewards of gaining control are obvious. It&#8217;s incredible how much a person can get done—while also maintaining a balanced lifestyle—if they&#8217;re in control of their time point spending. And those not in control will lose most of their time points to Q3 and Q4 and feel like they don&#8217;t have time for either their work or their lifestyle, all while accomplishing very little. Time point allotment is everything.</p><p>A procrastinator in desperate straits can take a half step in the right direction through the brute force method of rearranging his life in a way that makes him a successtinator. That&#8217;s where I am now, and it&#8217;s a hell of a lot better than where I was before.</p><p>But that&#8217;s like hiring a bodyguard instead of learning how to fight. The real goal of a procrastinator must be to figure out how to become the boss of his brain. A procrastinator&#8217;s reality is that his inner self—his Rational Decision-Maker—is the grandmaster of his life in theory, but in practice, only a spectator. The procrastinator&#8217;s RDM goes, helplessly, where the waves take him, shuffled from activity to activity by the primal forces of the monkey and the Panic Monster. Until a procrastinator&#8217;s RDM can walk, on his own, from Q4 to Q2, whenever he wants to, he&#8217;s not fixed.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you Google &#8220;how to stop procrastinating,&#8221; you&#8217;ll find about 1,000 articles, all offering terrific advice on how to do it. The problem is that the articles are always written for sane people, and procrastinators aren&#8217;t sane people. Being insane, procrastinators are always under the delusion that they&#8217;re sane, so they read an advice article and <em>think </em>they&#8217;ll be able to apply it to their life. But then it doesn&#8217;t work out that way.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before a procrastinator can act on good advice, he needs to have control. A race car driver can get all the coaching in the world, but if, when the race starts, someone else is controlling the steering wheel and the pedals, all the coaching is useless.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That&#8217;s why the only way a procrastinator can take the wheel in his hands is if his self-fulfilling prophecy—his <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>storyline</em></a>— says that he can. And storylines only change with real-world action. Quite the chicken and egg issue.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At its deepest level, it comes down to a battle of confidence. The RDM and monkey each have their own idea of how to spend your time points, and whichever of them is more confident—whoever has a stronger belief that <em>they&#8217;re </em>the alpha dog in the relationship—ends up prevailing. The difference between a procrastinator and a non-procrastinator is simply that the procrastinator&#8217;s monkey and RDM both believe that the monkey is the alpha dog, and the non-procrastinator&#8217;s pair both believe that the RDM is the boss.</p><p>But as firmly entrenched as these confidence levels may feel, the monkey and the RDM share a single pool of confidence with a fixed sum—when one&#8217;s confidence goes up, the other&#8217;s goes down—and the balance can begin to be tipped by the smallest changes, taking your storyline with it.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Figuring out the starting point of this chicken and egg paradox is each procrastinator&#8217;s personal quest. But a universal starting point is to try to remain <em>aware</em> as much as possible. Aware of what&#8217;s important, aware of what&#8217;s urgent, and most importantly—aware of the monkey. The monkey is not your friend, and he never will be. But he&#8217;s also part of your head and impossible to get rid of, so get in the habit of noticing him. When you wake up in the morning, he&#8217;ll be there. When you sit down to work, he&#8217;ll be there. Whenever you most badly need all the guts and grit you can muster, he&#8217;ll be there to take your guts and grit away.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But he thrives off of unconsciousness. Simply by noticing him and saying to yourself, &#8220;Yup, there&#8217;s the monkey, right on cue,&#8221; you can start to tip the balance out of its default state. Then maybe one day, you&#8217;ll find yourself nonchalantly shoving the monkey off of the wheel with the simplest, &#8220;No monkey, not now.&#8221; And your life will be forever changed.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I love the emails I&#8217;ve received about procrastination, and I hope they continue. But I always wish the people who have emailed me could hear each other&#8217;s stories. I encourage anyone who feels like sharing their story to do so in the comments.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>If this post was up your alley, also check out:</strong></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Wait But Why&#8217;s two earlier posts on procrastination – <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\">Part 2</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Life is just today over and over and over again – <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html\" target=\"_blank\">Life is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel</a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A one-image reminder to spend your time points wisely – <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html\" target=\"_blank\">Your Life in Weeks</a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A deeper look at what goes on in our brains and why awareness is so critical – <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">A Religion for the Non-Religious</a></p><p>A look at a different animal struggle going on in a different part of the brain – <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Taming the Mammoth: Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think</a></p><h2><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>And while they&#8217;re ruining your life, you might as well cuddle with them:</strong></span><br /><a href=\"http://store.waitbutwhy.com/collections/plush-toys\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3107\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/plushies-ad-for-post.jpg\" alt=\"plushies ad for post\" width=\"600\" height=\"329\" /></a></h2><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-3539\" class=\"footnote\"><p>For the uninitiated, the Instant Gratification Monkey is the part of your brain that makes you procrastinate—he&#8217;s a primal part of you who lives to maximize the ease of the present moment.

If each living human were represented by a dry grain of rice, the rice would fill a cube-shaped box with a side of 6.1 meters,<a href=\"#footnote2-1-3475\" id=\"note2-1-3475\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> or about 20 feet—around the size of a two-story house.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rice.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3500 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rice.png\" alt=\"Rice\" width=\"651\" height=\"360\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s a lot of rice grains.</p><p>And how about 7.3 billion grains of sand? Well according to this <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Wentworth-Grain-Size-Chart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">delightful chart</a>, &#8220;sand&#8221; can mean a lot of things. 7.3 billion &#8220;very coarse&#8221; grains (about 2mm in diameter) would fill a large cubic room with a height of 4m (13ft). 7.3 billion medium-size grains (.25mm in diameter) would fill a medium, 46cm high (1.5ft) cardboard box. And 7.3 billion of the finest, .0625mm sand grains (any smaller and it wouldn&#8217;t be sand anymore—it would be silt) would take up about 1,700 cubic centimeters of space, almost but not quite filling a 2-liter soda bottle.</p><p>Also, walking 7.3 billion steps would take you around the Earth&#8230;150 times. (At two steps per second, that would take you 115 years.) (I&#8217;m doing that thing where I&#8217;m going on divergent math spirals during the post and then just putting what I figured out into the actual post. I&#8217;ll try to stay on topic here but it won&#8217;t be easy. Let&#8217;s keep going.)</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><b>7.3 billion humans in one-dimensional configurations</b></span></p><p>The first activity today will be putting all humans in a single file line.

We build bridges over oceans and tunnels through mountains to make a clean line along the equator. Eventually, the line goes around the whole Earth gets back to Carlos.

Nine adults in the square managed fine and the addition of children into the mix should be able to easily increase that total by one to 10 (yes, some adults are much larger than average, but others are tiny—the world&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-12-439.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">average adult</a> is a not-that-large 62kg (137lb) person).</p></div><p>At 10 people per square meter, we can fit 1,000 people in a 10m x 10m square.

Translated into three dimensions, that means an atom&#8217;s nucleus makes up only around one <i>quadrillionth </i>of an atom&#8217;s total volume. The way I visualize this is by imagining an atom to be a cubic kilometer—a hollow cube taller than the tallest skyscraper (around the size of our humanity cube above). This building is so large that if you were inside it, hanging from the ceiling, and you let go, it would take you about 15 seconds of free fall before you hit the ground.

It&#8217;s not for everyone—but I&#8217;d click the shit out of that headline if I saw it on Facebook.</p><p>This year, I&#8217;ve gone a different direction. I&#8217;ve created <em>one of the least clickable headlines in the history of the internet. </em></p><p>Here&#8217;s what the full scale looks like:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/clickbait2.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3454 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/clickbait2.png\" alt=\"clickbait\" width=\"550\" height=\"497\" /></a></p><p>So forgive me if I&#8217;m a little confused why you&#8217;re here right now—why you&#8217;re voluntarily involving yourself in a piece of writing that will focus on Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S.

I&#8217;m pretty into history, and that was about all I knew.</p><p>So I decided to dig in—way more in depth than I dug into the first 16—to the abyss between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. Because if we&#8217;re gonna do this—we&#8217;re gonna really do this.</p><p>Three notes before we start:</p><p><strong>1) Here&#8217;s this chart again:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PartyVotes-Presidents.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3433\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PartyVotes-Presidents.png\" alt=\"PartyVotes-Presidents\" width=\"797\" height=\"364\" /></a></p><p>You can see that after the political chaos of the first 16 presidencies (a time period which constitutes both what historians call <em>The First Party System</em>—up through Quincy Adams—and <em>The Second Party System</em>—from Jackson to Pierce), things settle down into a clean Republican vs. Democrat divide. The period we&#8217;ll cover in this post is 36 years long, running from the Civil War to the dawn of the 20th Century—a period Mark Twain first called The Gilded Age.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3429\" id=\"note-1-3429\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><p>The politics of this period are what historians call <em>The Third Party System</em>—and in this system, there are Republicans and Democrats, which sounds familiar, but those parties barely resemble those same two parties today. If anything, the Republicans of The Gilded Age may have more in common with today&#8217;s Democrats and the Democrats of that time may better resemble today&#8217;s Republicans (although of course, it&#8217;s blurry, and both parties back then contain a mix of the two parties today, as well as having certain characteristics that don&#8217;t exist today at all, which makes comparisons of then vs. now a bit of an apples-to-oranges situation).</p><p>As you can see on the chart, the Gilded Age Republicans, who made up most of the Civil War&#8217;s victorious North, largely dominated the era.</p><p><strong>2) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#8217;s the chart</a> that shows the aggregation of historians&#8217; rankings of the presidents.</strong> Of course, even the aggregate ranks are totally subjective and not at all definitive—but I believe it&#8217;s the best way to give each president a ranking that reflects the general scholarly consensus on how the presidents stack up against each other. The aggregate column in that chart is where I draw my rankings from below each president&#8217;s name.</p><p>And how does this post&#8217;s group fare in the rankings? <em>None </em>of the eight presidents crack the top 18. What a crew.</p><p><strong>3) This is a critical time to refresh yourself on the Mustache Era.</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mustache.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3434\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mustache.png\" alt=\"Mustache\" width=\"756\" height=\"94\" /></a></p><p>The Mustache Era is an unprecedented time in American history, during which presidential mustaches were rampant. And never before or after the mustache era was there <em>any </em>other presidential mustache. The Gilded Age that we&#8217;ll be covering today overlaps almost entirely with the Mustache Era.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3429\" id=\"note-2-3429\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a><p>And now it&#8217;s time to buckle up and hold on tight as I take you on a whirlwind tour of eight of the most random men in the world.

Johnson capped off his epic journey by making the odd decision to stand on the top rung of the ladder being a dick for four years and followed that up by plunging all the way back down to the ground in disgrace. He spent the rest of his life losing small elections before finally winning a Senate seat four months before dying. Of his late-life Senate win, Johnson remarked, &#8220;Thank God for this vindication,&#8221; which was a weird thing to say since today he&#8217;s known as the third worst president in US history and mostly just comes up as the answer to the pre-1998 trivia question, &#8220;Who is the only US president to be impeached?&#8221;</p><p><strong>His Presidency: </strong>Johnson was chosen to be Lincoln&#8217;s running mate in 1864 (before Lincoln&#8217;s second term) because he was a rare combo: a politician from the South (Tennessee) and one of Lincoln&#8217;s rival Democrats, but one who was also fervently pro-Union and anti-secession—this made him the perfect choice to help Lincoln win the election and send the message of cross-party and cross-region collaboration and national unity. Six weeks after winning the election, Johnson and Lincoln held their first and last meeting as president and vice president, because that night, Lincoln was shot.</p><p>New President Johnson inherited a nation that had <em>just </em>come out of Civil War. The smoke was still clearing and the plan had been for Lincoln to spend his second term making a trillion critical decisions for the future of the country. With a clear winner to the war, and one party, Lincoln&#8217;s Republicans, in an unusual position of power, it was a rare opportunity to reshape the nation for the future and finally shed off the conflicts of the past, like slavery, that had plagued the country since its beginning. And Lincoln would <em>really </em>have been a great person to do that.</p><p>Instead, the hypercharged Republicans were suddenly led by a Southern Democrat, who it turns out didn&#8217;t really agree with much of what Lincoln had planned to do for the post-war Reconstruction effort. Johnson spent the next four years doing everything he could to get in the way of major Republican progress. The Republicans wanted to be tough with the South, punishing prominent Confederate politicians and refusing to offer reconstruction aid until Southern states agreed to grant equal rights and citizenship to newly-freed slaves—but Johnson vetoed most of the bills that the Republican Congress tried to pass, including the Civil Rights Bill, arguing that it gave “a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union.” He wrote, in a letter to a governor, “this is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men.” Lincoln would have been proud.</p><p>The Republicans, who despised Johnson, successfully impeached him in 1868, claiming he had acted outside the president&#8217;s legal boundaries on several occasions—and at his impeachment trial, they fell one vote short of ousting him from office. The next year, he got crushed in his own primary and never even had a chance to run for a second term.</p><p>Johnson&#8217;s presidency ties with Buchanan&#8217;s for most maddening to read about.</p><p><strong>Things He Can Brag About: </strong></p><ul><li>Being the only president to serve in the Senate after his presidency</li><li>Alaska is Johnson&#8217;s doing. His Secretary of State, William Seward, bought it from Russia for $7.2 million ($121 million in today&#8217;s dollars). At the time, Americans viewed this as a terrible deal and the whole thing was referred to, for a while, as &#8220;Seward&#8217;s Folly.&#8221;</li></ul><p><strong>Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember: </strong></p><ul><li>His white supremacist quote I included above</li><li>In what is definitely the funniest thing I&#8217;ve read so far in my research on the first 24 presidents, Johnson, at his and Lincoln&#8217;s 1864 inauguration, showed up at the event <em>hammered </em>and proceeded to make a complete debacle of a long, rambling, drunken speech as Lincoln and the entire Senate Chamber looked on in shock. A Senator who attended said afterwards, &#8220;I was never so mortified in my life—had I been able to find a hole I would have dropped through it out of sight.&#8221; Johnson then disappeared into reclusion for six weeks to avoid public ridicule.</li><li>He owned about nine slaves before becoming vice president, and is rumored to have fathered children with one of them.</li></ul><p><strong>Things He’s Annoyed About:</strong></p><ul><li>Apparently he celebrated his 60th birthday by having a party for several hundred children, which sounds like an incredibly unfun party and something that definitely wasn&#8217;t his idea.</li><li>Clinton&#8217;s impeachment.

Grant had a major falling out with Johnson during Johnson&#8217;s presidency, presumably because of Johnson&#8217;s whole &#8220;trying to undo all the progress of the Civil War&#8221; thing. Grant wouldn&#8217;t allow his kids to attend Johnson&#8217;s 60th birthday party, and Johnson refused to attend Grant&#8217;s inauguration.</li><li>Lincoln&#8217;s assassination was actually supposed to be part of a three-assassination trifecta, all in the same night. Two of Booth&#8217;s co-conspirators had plans to shoot VP Johnson and Secretary of State Seward. The attempt on Seward nearly succeeded, injuring him badly. But apparently Johnson&#8217;s would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, didn&#8217;t even attempt to kill Johnson because he <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Atzerodt\" target=\"_blank\">got drunk instead</a>.

Part 1 ended with me assaulting you with the fact that once our machines reach human-level intelligence, they might immediately do this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3366\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train1.png\" alt=\"Train1\" width=\"450\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3367\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train2.png\" alt=\"Train2\" width=\"450\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3368\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train3.png\" alt=\"Train3\" width=\"450\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3369\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Train4.png\" alt=\"Train4\" width=\"450\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>This left us staring at the screen, confronting the intense concept of potentially-in-our-lifetime Artificial Superintelligence, or ASI (AI that&#8217;s <em>way </em>smarter than any human, across the board), and trying to figure out which emotion we were supposed to have on as we thought about that.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3269\" id=\"note-1-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3269\" id=\"note2-1-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><sup>← open these</sup></span></p><p>Before we dive into things, let&#8217;s remind ourselves what it would mean for a machine to be superintelligent.</p><p>A key distinction is the difference between <em>speed superintelligence </em>and <em>quality superintelligence</em>. Often, someone&#8217;s first thought when they imagine a super-smart computer is one that&#8217;s as intelligent as a human but can think much, much <em>faster</em><a href=\"#footnote-2-3269\" id=\"note-2-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a>—they might picture a machine that thinks like a human, except a million times quicker, which means it could figure out in five minutes what would take a human a decade.</p><p>That sounds impressive, and ASI <em>would</em> think much faster than any human could—but the true separator would be its advantage in intelligence <em>quality</em>, which is something completely different. What makes humans so much more intellectually capable than chimps isn&#8217;t a difference in thinking speed—it&#8217;s that human brains contain a number of sophisticated cognitive modules that enable things like complex linguistic representations or longterm planning or abstract reasoning, that chimps&#8217; brains do not. Speeding up a chimp&#8217;s brain by thousands of times wouldn&#8217;t bring him to our level—even with a decade&#8217;s time, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to figure out how to use a set of custom tools to assemble an intricate model, something a human could knock out in a few hours. There are worlds of human cognitive function a chimp will simply never be capable of, no matter how much time he spends trying.</p><p>But it&#8217;s not just that a chimp can&#8217;t do what we do, it&#8217;s that his brain is unable to grasp that those worlds even <em>exist—</em>a chimp can become familiar with what a human is and what a skyscraper is, but he&#8217;ll never be able to understand that the skyscraper was <em>built</em><em>by</em> humans. In his world, anything that huge is part of nature, period, and not only is it beyond him to build a skyscraper, it&#8217;s beyond him to <em>realize that</em><em>anyone can build a skyscraper.</em> That&#8217;s the result of a small difference in intelligence quality.</p><p>And in the scheme of the intelligence range we&#8217;re talking about today, or even the much smaller range among biological creatures, the chimp-to-human quality intelligence gap is <em>tiny</em>. In an earlier <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>, I depicted the range of biological cognitive capacity using a staircase:<a href=\"#footnote-3-3269\" id=\"note-3-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3381\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase1.png\" alt=\"staircase\" width=\"500\" height=\"512\" /></a></p><p>To absorb how big a deal a superintelligent machine would be, imagine one on the dark green step two steps above humans on that staircase. This machine would be only <em>slightly </em>superintelligent, but its increased cognitive ability over us would be as vast as the chimp-human gap we just described. And like the chimp&#8217;s incapacity to ever absorb that skyscrapers can be built, we will never be able to even comprehend the things a machine on the dark green step can do, even if the machine tried to explain it to us—let alone do it ourselves. And that&#8217;s only two steps above us. A machine on the second-to-highest step on that staircase would be to us as we are to ants—it could try for years to teach us the simplest inkling of what it knows and the endeavor would be hopeless.</p><p>But the kind of superintelligence we&#8217;re talking about today is something far beyond anything on this staircase. In an intelligence explosion—where the smarter a machine gets, the quicker it&#8217;s able to increase its own intelligence, until it begins to <em>soar</em> upwards—a machine might take years to rise from the chimp step to the one above it, but perhaps only hours to jump up a step once it&#8217;s on the dark green step two above us, and by the time it&#8217;s ten steps above us, it might be jumping up in four-step leaps every second that goes by. Which is why we need to realize that it&#8217;s distinctly possible that very shortly after the big news story about the first machine reaching human-level AGI, we might be facing the reality of coexisting on the Earth with something that&#8217;s here on the staircase (or maybe a million times higher):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3364\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png\" alt=\"staircase2\" width=\"650\" height=\"552\" /></a></p><p>And since we just established that it&#8217;s a hopeless activity to try to understand the power of a machine only two steps above us, let&#8217;s very concretely state once and for all that <strong>there is no way to know what ASI will do or what the consequences will be for us.<i></i></strong>Anyone who pretends otherwise doesn&#8217;t understand what superintelligence means.</p><p>Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we&#8217;ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is <em>part </em>of evolution—maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it&#8217;s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tripwire.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3370\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tripwire.png\" alt=\"Tripwire\" width=\"500\" height=\"411\" /></a></p><p>And for reasons we&#8217;ll discuss later, a huge part of the scientific community believes that it&#8217;s not a matter of whether we&#8217;ll hit that tripwire, but when. Kind of a crazy piece of information.</p><p>So where does that leave us?</p><p>Well no one in the world, especially not I, can tell you what will happen when we hit the tripwire. But Oxford philosopher and lead AI thinker Nick Bostrom believes we can boil down all potential outcomes into two broad categories.</p><p>First, looking at history, we can see that life works like this: species pop up, exist for a while, and after some time, inevitably, they fall off the existence balance beam and land on extinction—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3358\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam1.png\" alt=\"beam1\" width=\"552\" height=\"352\" /></a></p><p>&#8220;All species eventually go extinct&#8221; has been almost as reliable a rule through history as &#8220;All humans eventually die&#8221; has been. So far, 99.9% of species have fallen off the balance beam, and it seems pretty clear that if a species keeps wobbling along down the beam, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before some other species, some gust of nature&#8217;s wind, or a sudden beam-shaking asteroid knocks it off. Bostrom calls extinction an <em>attractor state</em>—a place species are all teetering on falling into and from which no species ever returns.</p><p>And while most scientists I&#8217;ve come across acknowledge that ASI would have the ability to send humans to extinction, many also believe that used beneficially, ASI&#8217;s abilities could be used to bring individual humans, and the species as a whole, to a <em>second</em> attractor state—species immortality. Bostrom believes species immortality is just as much of an attractor state as species extinction, i.e. if we manage to get there, we&#8217;ll be impervious to extinction forever—we&#8217;ll have conquered mortality and conquered chance. So even though all species <em>so far </em>have fallen off the balance beam and landed on extinction, Bostrom believes there are two sides to the beam and it&#8217;s just that nothing on Earth has been intelligent enough yet to figure out how to fall off on the other side.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3389\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam2.jpg\" alt=\"beam2\" width=\"551\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p>If Bostrom and others are right, and from everything I&#8217;ve read, it seems like they really might be, we have two pretty shocking facts to absorb:</p><p><strong>1) The advent of ASI will, for the first time, open up the possibility for a species to land on the immortality side of the balance beam.</strong></p><p><strong>2) The advent of ASI will make such an unimaginably dramatic impact that it&#8217;s likely to knock the human race off the beam, in one direction or the other. </strong></p><p>It may very well be that when evolution hits the tripwire, it permanently ends humans&#8217; relationship with the beam and creates a new world, with or without humans.</p><p>Kind of seems like the only question any human should currently be asking is: <em>When are we going to hit the tripwire and which side of the beam will we land on when that happens?</em></p><p>No one in the world knows the answer to either part of that question, but a lot of the very smartest people have put decades of thought into it. We&#8217;ll spend the rest of this post exploring what they&#8217;ve come up with.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let&#8217;s start with the first part of the question: <em>When are we going to hit the tripwire?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">i.e. How long until the first machine reaches superintelligence?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not shockingly, opinions vary wildly and this is a heated debate among scientists and thinkers. Many, like professor <a href=\"https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vernor Vinge</a>, scientist <a href=\"http://goertzel.org/TenYearsToTheSingularity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Goertzel</a>, Sun Microsystems co-founder <a href=\"http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Joy</a>, or, most famously, inventor and futurist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Kurzweil</a>, agree with machine learning expert Jeremy Howard when he puts up this graph during a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a>:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Howard-Graph.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3361\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Howard-Graph.png\" alt=\"Howard Graph\" width=\"550\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Those people subscribe to the belief that this is happening <em>soon—</em>that exponential growth is at work and machine learning, though only slowly creeping up on us now, will blow right past us within the next few decades.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Others, like Microsoft co-founder <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Allen</a>, research psychologist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hyping-artificial-intelligence-yet-again\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Marcus</a>, NYU computer scientist <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/568\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Davis</a>, and tech entrepreneur <a href=\"http://longbets.org/1/\" target=\"_blank\">Mitch Kapor</a>, believe that thinkers like Kurzweil are <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/\" target=\"_blank\">vastly underestimating</a> the magnitude of the challenge and believe that we&#8217;re not actually that close to the tripwire.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Kurzweil camp would <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425818/kurzweil-responds-dont-underestimate-the-singularity/\" target=\"_blank\">counter</a> that the only underestimating that&#8217;s happening is the underappreciation of exponential growth, and they&#8217;d compare the doubters to those who looked at the slow-growing seedling of the internet in 1985 and argued that there was no way it would amount to anything impactful in the near future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The doubters might argue back that the progress needed to make advancements in intelligence <em>also</em> grows exponentially harder with each subsequent step, which will cancel out the typical exponential nature of technological progress. And so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A third camp, which includes <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199678111&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=LBOTX2G2R72P5EUA\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Bostrom</a>, believes neither group has any ground to feel certain about the timeline and acknowledges both A) that this could absolutely happen in the near future and B) that there&#8217;s no guarantee about that; it could also take a much longer time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still others, like philosopher <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262540673/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262540673&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=ZHBAVUQOM6SIGYHG\" target=\"_blank\">Hubert Dreyfus</a>, believe all three of these groups are naive for believing that there even is a tripwire, arguing that it&#8217;s more likely that ASI won&#8217;t actually ever be achieved.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So what do you get when you put all of these opinions together?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2013, Vincent C. Müller and Nick Bostrom conducted a survey that asked hundreds of AI experts at a series of conferences the following question: &#8220;For the purposes of this question, assume that human scientific activity continues without major negative disruption. By what year would you see a (10% / 50% / 90%) probability for such HLMI<a href=\"#footnote-4-3269\" id=\"note-4-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> to exist?&#8221; It asked them to name an optimistic year (one in which they believe there&#8217;s a 10% chance we&#8217;ll have AGI), a realistic guess (a year they believe there&#8217;s a 50% chance of AGI—i.e. after that year they think it&#8217;s more likely than not that we&#8217;ll have AGI), and a safe guess (the earliest year by which they can say with 90% certainty we&#8217;ll have AGI). Gathered together as one data set, here were the results:<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3269\" id=\"note2-2-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Median optimistic year (10% likelihood):<strong> 2022<br /></strong>Median realistic year (50% likelihood):<strong><strong> 2040</strong><br /></strong>Median pessimistic year (90% likelihood):<strong><strong> 2075</strong><br /></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So the median participant thinks it&#8217;s more likely than not that we&#8217;ll have AGI 25 years from now. The 90% median answer of 2075 means that if you&#8217;re a teenager right now, the median respondent, along with over half of the group of AI experts, is almost certain AGI will happen within your lifetime.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A separate study, conducted recently by author James Barrat at Ben Goertzel&#8217;s annual AGI Conference, did away with percentages and simply asked when participants thought AGI would be achieved—by 2030, by 2050, by 2100, after 2100, or never. The results:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3269\" id=\"note2-3-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">By 2030: <strong>42% of respondents<br /></strong>By 2050: <strong>25%</strong><br />
By 2100: <b>20%<br /></b>After 2100: <strong>10%</strong><br />
Never: <strong>2%</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pretty similar to Müller and Bostrom&#8217;s outcomes. In Barrat&#8217;s survey, over two thirds of participants believe AGI will be here by 2050 and a little less than half predict AGI within the next 15 years. Also striking is that only 2% of those surveyed don&#8217;t think AGI is part of our future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But AGI isn&#8217;t the tripwire, ASI is. So when do the experts think we&#8217;ll reach ASI?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Müller and Bostrom also asked the experts how likely they think it is that we&#8217;ll reach ASI A) within two years of reaching AGI (i.e. an almost-immediate intelligence explosion), and B) within 30 years. The results:<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3269\" id=\"note2-4-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The median answer put a rapid (2 year) AGI → ASI transition at only a <strong>10%</strong> likelihood, but a longer transition of 30 years or less at a <strong>75%</strong> likelihood.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We don&#8217;t know from this data the length of this transition the median participant would have put at a 50% likelihood, but for ballpark purposes, based on the two answers above, let&#8217;s estimate that they&#8217;d have said 20 years. So the median opinion—the one right in the center of the world of AI experts—believes the most realistic guess for when we&#8217;ll hit the ASI tripwire is [the 2040 prediction for AGI + our estimated prediction of a 20-year transition from AGI to ASI] <strong>= 2060</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Timeline.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3365\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Timeline.png\" alt=\"Timeline\" width=\"550\" height=\"287\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, all of the above statistics are speculative, and they&#8217;re only representative of the center opinion of the AI expert community, but it tells us that a large portion of the people who know the most about this topic would agree that 2060 is a very reasonable estimate for the arrival of potentially world-altering ASI. Only 45 years from now.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Okay now how about the second part of the question above: <em>When we hit the tripwire, which side of the beam will we fall to?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Superintelligence will yield tremendous power—the critical question for us is:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Who or what will be in control of that power, and what will their motivation be?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The answer to this will determine whether ASI is an unbelievably great development, an unfathomably terrible development, or something in between.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, the expert community is again all over the board and in a heated debate about the answer to this question. Müller and Bostrom&#8217;s survey asked participants to assign a probability to the possible impacts AGI would have on humanity and found that the mean response was that there was <strong>a</strong><strong>52% chance that the outcome will be either good or extremely good and a 31% chance the outcome will be either bad or extremely bad. </strong>For a relatively neutral outcome, the mean probability was only 17%. In other words, the people who know the most about this are pretty sure this will be a huge deal. It&#8217;s also worth noting that those numbers refer to the advent of <em>AGI—</em>if the question were about ASI, I imagine that the neutral percentage would be even lower.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before we dive much further into this good vs. bad outcome part of the question, let&#8217;s combine both the &#8220;when will it happen?&#8221; and the &#8220;will it be good or bad?&#8221; parts of this question into a chart that encompasses the views of most of the relevant experts:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3377\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square11.jpg\" alt=\"Square1\" width=\"675\" height=\"1144\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We&#8217;ll talk more about the Main Camp in a minute, but first—what&#8217;s your deal? Actually I know what your deal is, because it was my deal too before I started researching this topic. Some reasons most people aren&#8217;t really thinking about this topic:</p><ul><li style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned in Part 1, movies have really confused things by presenting unrealistic AI scenarios that make us feel like AI isn&#8217;t something to be taken seriously in general. James Barrat compares the situation to our reaction if the Centers for Disease Control issued a serious warning about vampires in our future.<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3269\" id=\"note2-5-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a></li><li style=\"text-align: left;\">Due to something called <em>cognitive biases</em>, we have a hard time believing something is real until we see proof. I&#8217;m sure computer scientists in 1988 were regularly talking about how big a deal the internet was likely to be, but people probably didn&#8217;t <em>really </em>think it was going to change their lives until it actually changed their lives. This is partially because computers just couldn&#8217;t do stuff like that in 1988, so people would look at their computer and think, &#8220;Really? <em>That&#8217;s</em> gonna be a life changing thing?&#8221; Their imaginations were limited to what their personal experience had taught them about what a computer was, which made it very hard to vividly picture what computers might <em>become</em>. The same thing is happening now with AI. We hear that it&#8217;s gonna be a big deal, but because it hasn&#8217;t happened yet, and because of our experience with the relatively impotent AI in our current world, we have a hard time <em>really </em>believing this is going to change our lives dramatically. And those biases are what experts are up against as they frantically try to get our attention through the noise of collective daily self-absorption.</li><li style=\"text-align: left;\">Even if we did believe it—how many times today have you thought about the fact that you&#8217;ll spend most of the rest of eternity not existing? Not many, right? Even though it&#8217;s a far more intense fact than anything else you&#8217;re doing today? This is because our brains are normally focused on the little things in day-to-day life, no matter <em>how </em>crazy a long-term situation we&#8217;re a part of. It&#8217;s just how we&#8217;re wired.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the goals of these two posts is to get you out of the I Like to Think About Other Things Camp and into one of the expert camps, even if you&#8217;re just standing on the intersection of the two dotted lines in the square above, totally uncertain.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During my research, I came across dozens of varying opinions on this topic, but I quickly noticed that most people&#8217;s opinions fell somewhere in what I labeled the Main Camp, and in particular, over three quarters of the experts fell into two Subcamps inside the Main Camp:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3384\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square21.jpg\" alt=\"Square2\" width=\"600\" height=\"593\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We&#8217;re gonna take a thorough dive into both of these camps. Let&#8217;s start with the fun one—</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why the Future Might Be Our Greatest Dream</h2><p class=\"p1\">As I learned about the world of AI, I found a surprisingly large number of people standing here:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square32.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3391\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square32.jpg\" alt=\"Square3\" width=\"550\" height=\"543\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The people on Confident Corner are buzzing with excitement. They have their sights set on the fun side of the balance beam and they&#8217;re convinced that&#8217;s where all of us are headed. For them, the future is everything they ever could have hoped for, just in time.</p><p class=\"p1\">The thing that separates these people from the other thinkers we&#8217;ll discuss later isn&#8217;t their lust for the happy side of the beam—it&#8217;s their confidence that that&#8217;s the side we&#8217;re going to land on.</p><p class=\"p1\">Where this confidence comes from is up for debate. Critics believe it comes from an excitement so blinding that they simply ignore or deny potential negative outcomes. But the believers say it&#8217;s naive to conjure up doomsday scenarios when on balance, technology has and will likely end up continuing to help us a lot more than it hurts us.</p><p class=\"p1\">We&#8217;ll cover both sides, and you can form your own opinion about this as you read, but for this section, put your skepticism away and let&#8217;s take a good hard look at what&#8217;s over there on the fun side of the balance beam—and try to absorb the fact that the things you&#8217;re reading <em>might really happen</em>. If you had shown a hunter-gatherer our world of indoor comfort, technology, and endless abundance, it would have seemed like fictional magic to him—we have to be humble enough to acknowledge that it&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that an equally inconceivable transformation could be in our future.</p><p class=\"p1\">Nick Bostrom describes three ways a superintelligent AI system could function:<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3269\" id=\"note2-6-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><ul><li class=\"p1\">As an <strong>oracle</strong>, which answers nearly any question posed to it with accuracy, including complex questions that humans cannot easily answer—i.e. <em>How can I manufacture a more efficient car engine?</em> Google is a primitive type of oracle.</li><li class=\"p1\">As a <strong>genie</strong><em>,</em> which executes any high-level command it&#8217;s given—<em>Use a molecular assembler to build a new and more efficient kind of car engine</em>—and then awaits its next command.</li><li class=\"p1\">As a <strong>sovereign</strong>, which is assigned a broad and open-ended pursuit and allowed to operate in the world freely, making its own decisions about how best to proceed—<i>Invent a faster, cheaper, and safer way than cars for humans to privately transport themselves.</i></li></ul><p>These questions and tasks, which seem complicated to us, would sound to a superintelligent system like someone asking you to improve upon the &#8220;My pencil fell off the table&#8221; situation, which you&#8217;d do by picking it up and putting it back on the table.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.yudkowsky.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>, a resident of Anxious Avenue in our chart above, said it well:</p><blockquote><p>There are no hard problems, only problems that are hard to a certain level of intelligence. Move the smallest bit upwards [in level of intelligence], and some problems will suddenly move from “impossible” to “obvious.” Move a substantial degree upwards, and all of them will become obvious.<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3269\" id=\"note2-7-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a></blockquote><p>There are a lot of eager scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs in Confident Corner—but for a tour of brightest side of the AI horizon, there&#8217;s only one person we want as our tour guide.</p><p>Ray Kurzweil is polarizing. In my reading, I heard everything from godlike worship of him and his ideas to eye-rolling contempt for them. Others were somewhere in the middle—author Douglas Hofstadter, in discussing the ideas in Kurzweil&#8217;s books, eloquently put forth that &#8220;it is as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can&#8217;t possibly figure out what&#8217;s good or bad.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3269\" id=\"note2-8-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p>Whether you like his ideas or not, everyone agrees that Kurzweil is impressive. He began inventing things as a teenager and in the following decades, he came up with several breakthrough inventions, including <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">the first flatbed scanner, the first scanner that converted text to speech (allowing the blind to read standard texts), the well-known Kurzweil music synthesizer (the first true electric piano), and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. He&#8217;s the author of five national bestselling books. He&#8217;s well-known for his bold predictions and has a <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/why-ray-kurzweils-predictions-are-right-86-of-the-time\" target=\"_blank\">pretty good record</a> of having them come true—including his prediction in the late &#8217;80s, a time when the internet was an obscure thing, that by the early 2000s, it would become a global phenomenon. Kurzweil has been called a &#8220;restless genius&#8221; by The Wall Street Journal, &#8220;the ultimate thinking machine&#8221; by Forbes, &#8220;Edison&#8217;s rightful heir&#8221; by Inc. Magazine, and &#8220;</span>the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence&#8221; by Bill Gates.<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3269\" id=\"note2-9-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> In 2012, Google co-founder Larry Page approached Kurzweil and asked him to be Google&#8217;s Director of Engineering.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3269\" id=\"note-5-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> In 2011, he co-founded <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Singularity University</a>, which is hosted by NASA and sponsored partially by Google. Not bad for one life.</p><p>This biography is important. When Kurzweil articulates his vision of the future, he sounds fully like a crackpot, and the crazy thing is that he&#8217;s not—he&#8217;s an extremely smart, knowledgeable, relevant man in the world. You may think he&#8217;s wrong about the future, but he&#8217;s not a fool. Knowing he&#8217;s a such a legit dude makes me <em>happy</em>, because as I&#8217;ve learned about his predictions for the future, I <em>badly </em>want him to be right. And you do too. As you hear Kurzweil&#8217;s predictions, many shared by other Confident Corner thinkers like <a href=\"http://www.diamandis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Diamandis</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Goertzel</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to see why he has such a large, passionate following—known as the singularitarians. Here&#8217;s what he thinks is going to happen:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Timeline</strong></span></p><p>Kurzweil believes computers will reach AGI by 2029 and that by 2045, we&#8217;ll have not only ASI, but a full-blown new world—a time he calls the singularity. His AI-related timeline used to be seen as outrageously overzealous, and it still is by many,<a href=\"#footnote-6-3269\" id=\"note-6-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> but in the last 15 years, the rapid advances of ANI systems have brought the larger world of AI experts much closer to Kurzweil&#8217;s timeline. His predictions are still a bit more ambitious than the median respondent on Müller and Bostrom&#8217;s survey (AGI by 2040, ASI by 2060), but not by that much.</p><p>Kurzweil&#8217;s depiction of the 2045 singularity is brought about by three simultaneous revolutions in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and, most powerfully, AI.</p><p>Before we move on—nanotechnology comes up in almost everything you read about the future of AI, so come into this blue box for a minute so we can discuss it—</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Nanotechnology Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>Nanotechnology is our word for technology that deals with the manipulation of matter that&#8217;s between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter, and this 1-100 range encompasses viruses (100 nm across), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as large molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).<a href=\"#footnote-7-3269\" id=\"note-7-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a><p>To understand the challenge of humans trying to manipulate matter in that range, let&#8217;s take the same thing on a larger scale. The International Space Station is 268 mi (431 km) above the Earth. If humans were giants so large their heads reached up to the ISS, they&#8217;d be about 250,000 times bigger than they are now. If you make the 1nm &#8211; 100nm nanotech range 250,000 times bigger, you get .25mm &#8211; 2.5cm. So nanotechnology is the equivalent of a human giant as tall as the ISS figuring out how to carefully build intricate objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand and an eyeball. To reach the next level—manipulating individual atoms—the giant would have to carefully position objects that are 1/40th of a millimeter—so small normal-size humans would need a microscope to see them.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3269\" id=\"note-8-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><p>Nanotech was first discussed by Richard Feynman in a 1959 talk, when he explained: “The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It would be, in principle, possible … for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down…. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.” It&#8217;s as simple as that. If you can figure out how to move individual molecules or atoms around, you can make literally anything.</p><p>Nanotech became a serious field for the first time in 1986, when engineer Eric Drexler provided its foundations in his seminal book <i>Engines of Creation, </i>but Drexler suggests that those looking to learn about the most modern ideas in nanotechnology would be best off reading his 2013 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610391136/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1610391136&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=AIDAWXXXQCHLBDCU\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radical Abundance</em></a>.</p><div class=\"wbwAside2\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Gray Goo Bluer Box</strong></span></p><p>We&#8217;re now in a diversion <em>in a diversion</em>. This is very fun.<a href=\"#footnote-9-3269\" id=\"note-9-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a><p>Anyway, I brought you here because there&#8217;s this really unfunny part of nanotechnology lore I need to tell you about. In older versions of nanotech theory, a proposed method of nanoassembly involved the creation of trillions of tiny nanobots that would work in conjunction to build something. One way to create trillions of nanobots would be to make one that could self-replicate and then let the reproduction process turn that one into two, those two then turn into four, four into eight, and in about a day, there&#8217;d be a few trillion of them ready to go. That&#8217;s the power of exponential growth. Clever, right?</p><p>It&#8217;s clever until it causes the grand and complete Earthwide apocalypse by accident. The issue is that the same power of exponential growth that makes it super convenient to quickly create a trillion nanobots makes self-replication a <em>terrifying </em>prospect. Because what if the system glitches, and instead of stopping replication once the total hits a few trillion as expected, they just keep replicating? The nanobots would be designed to consume any carbon-based material in order to feed the replication process, and unpleasantly, all life is carbon-based. The Earth&#8217;s biomass contains about 10<sup>45</sup> carbon atoms. A nanobot would consist of about 10<sup>6</sup> carbon atoms, so 10<sup>39</sup> nanobots would consume all life on Earth, which would happen in 130 replications (2<sup>130</sup> is about 10<sup>39</sup>), as oceans of nanobots (that&#8217;s the gray goo) rolled around the planet. Scientists think a nanobot could replicate in about 100 seconds, meaning this simple mistake would inconveniently end all life on Earth in 3.5 hours.</p><p>An even worse scenario—if a terrorist somehow got his hands on nanobot technology and had the know-how to program them, he could make an initial few trillion of them and program them to quietly spend a few weeks spreading themselves evenly around the world undetected. Then, they&#8217;d all strike at once, and it would only take 90 minutes for them to consume everything—and with them all spread out, there would be no way to combat them.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3269\" id=\"note2-10-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p>While this horror story has been widely discussed for years, the good news is that it may be overblown—Eric Drexler, who coined the term &#8220;gray goo,&#8221; sent me an email following this post with his thoughts on the gray goo scenario: &#8220;People love scare stories, and this one belongs with the zombies. The idea itself eats brains.&#8221;</p></div><p>Once we really get nanotech down, we can use it to make tech devices, clothing, food, a variety of bio-related products—artificial blood cells, tiny virus or cancer-cell destroyers, muscle tissue, etc.—anything really. And in a world that uses nanotechnology, the cost of a material is no longer tied to its scarcity or the difficulty of its manufacturing process, but instead determined by how complicated its atomic structure is. In a nanotech world, a diamond might be cheaper than a pencil eraser.</p><p>We&#8217;re not there yet. And it&#8217;s not clear if we&#8217;re underestimating, or overestimating, how hard it will be to get there. But we don&#8217;t seem to be that far away. Kurzweil predicts that we&#8217;ll get there by the 2020s.<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3269\" id=\"note2-11-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> Governments know that nanotech could be an Earth-shaking development, and they&#8217;ve invested billions of dollars in nanotech research (the US, the EU, and Japan have invested over a combined $5 billion so far).<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3269\" id=\"note2-12-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p>Just considering the possibilities if a superintelligent computer had access to a robust nanoscale assembler is intense. But nanotechnology is something <em>we </em>came up with, that we&#8217;re on the verge of conquering, and since anything that we can do is a joke to an ASI system, we have to assume ASI would come up with technologies much more powerful and far too advanced for human brains to understand. For that reason, when considering the &#8220;If the AI Revolution turns out well for us&#8221; scenario, it&#8217;s almost impossible for us to overestimate the scope of what could happen—so if the following predictions of an ASI future seem over-the-top, keep in mind that they could be accomplished in ways we can&#8217;t even imagine. Most likely, our brains aren&#8217;t even capable of predicting the things that would happen.</p></div><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>What AI Could Do For Us</strong></span></p><div id=\"attachment_3374\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/only-humans-cartoon.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3374\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/only-humans-cartoon.jpg\" alt=\"only-humans-cartoon\" width=\"311\" height=\"441\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=54Q62R5PYJBEENTP\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p></div><p>Armed with superintelligence and all the technology superintelligence would know how to create, ASI would likely be able to solve every problem in humanity. Global warming? ASI could first halt CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by coming up with much better ways to generate energy that had nothing to do with fossil fuels. Then it could create some innovative way to begin to remove excess CO<sub>2 </sub>from the atmosphere. Cancer and other diseases? No problem for ASI—health and medicine would be revolutionized beyond imagination. World hunger? ASI could use things like nanotech to <em>build </em>meat from scratch that would be <em>molecularly identical </em>to real meat—in other words, it would <em>be </em>real meat. Nanotech could turn a pile of garbage into a huge vat of fresh meat or other food (which wouldn&#8217;t have to have its normal shape—picture a giant cube of apple)—and distribute all this food around the world using ultra-advanced transportation. Of course, this would also be great for animals, who wouldn&#8217;t have to get killed by humans much anymore, and ASI could do lots of other things to save endangered species or even bring back extinct species through work with preserved DNA. ASI could even solve our most complex macro issues—our debates over how economies should be run and how world trade is best facilitated, even our haziest grapplings in philosophy or ethics—would all be painfully obvious to ASI.</p><p>But there&#8217;s one thing ASI could do for us that is <em>so </em>tantalizing, reading about it has altered everything I thought I knew about everything:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em><strong>ASI could allow us to conquer our mortality.</strong></em></span></p><p>A few months ago, I <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned</a> my envy of more advanced potential civilizations who had conquered their own mortality, never considering that I might later write a post that genuinely made me believe that this is something humans could do within my lifetime. But reading about AI will make you reconsider <em>everything</em> you thought you were sure about—including your notion of death.</p><p>Evolution had no good reason to extend our lifespans any longer than they are now. If we live long enough to reproduce and raise our children to an age that they can fend for themselves, that&#8217;s enough for evolution—from an evolutionary point of view, the species can thrive with a 30+ year lifespan, so there&#8217;s no reason mutations toward unusually long life would have been favored in the natural selection process. As a result, we&#8217;re what W.B. Yeats describes as &#8220;a soul fastened to a dying animal.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-13-3269\" id=\"note2-13-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a> Not that fun.</p><p>And because everyone has always died, we live under the &#8220;death and taxes&#8221; assumption that death is inevitable. We think of aging like time—both keep moving and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to stop them. <em>But</em><em>that assumption is wrong</em>. Richard Feynman writes:</p><blockquote><p class=\"p1\">It is one of the most remarkable things that in all of the biological sciences there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that this terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human’s body will be cured.</p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">The fact is, aging isn&#8217;t <em>stuck</em> to time. Time <em>will </em>continue moving, but <em>aging doesn&#8217;t have to</em>. If you think about it, it makes sense. All aging is is the physical materials of the body wearing down. A car wears down over time too—but is its aging inevitable? If you perfectly repaired or replaced a car&#8217;s parts whenever one of them began to wear down, the car would run forever. The human body isn&#8217;t any different—just far more complex.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kurzweil talks about intelligent wifi-connected nanobots in the bloodstream who could perform countless tasks for human health, including routinely repairing or replacing worn down cells in any part of the body. If perfected, this process (or a far smarter one ASI would come up with) wouldn&#8217;t just keep the body healthy, it could <em>reverse aging</em>. The difference between a 60-year-old&#8217;s body and a 30-year-old&#8217;s body is just a bunch of physical things that could be altered if we had the technology. ASI could build an &#8220;age refresher&#8221; that a 60-year-old could walk into, and they&#8217;d walk out with the body and skin of a 30-year-old.<a href=\"#footnote-10-3269\" id=\"note-10-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> Even the ever-befuddling brain could be refreshed by something as smart as ASI, which would figure out how to do so without affecting the brain&#8217;s data (personality, memories, etc.). A 90-year-old suffering from dementia could head into the age refresher and come out sharp as a tack and ready to start a whole new career. This seems absurd—but the body is just a bunch of atoms and ASI would presumably be able to easily manipulate all kinds of atomic structures—so it&#8217;s <em>not absurd</em>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kurzweil then takes things a huge leap further. He believes that artificial materials will be integrated into the body more and more as time goes on. First, organs could be replaced by super-advanced machine versions that would run forever and never fail. Then he believes we could begin to redesign the body—things like replacing red blood cells with perfected red blood cell nanobots who could power their own movement, eliminating the need for a heart <em>at all. </em>He even gets to the brain and believes we&#8217;ll <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVXQUItNEDQ\" target=\"_blank\">enhance our brain activities</a> to the point where humans will be able to <em>think </em>billions of times faster than they do now and access outside information because the artificial additions to the brain will be able to communicate with all the info in the cloud.</p><p class=\"p1\">The possibilities for new human experience would be endless. Humans have separated sex from its purpose, allowing people to have sex for fun, not just for reproduction. Kurzweil believes we&#8217;ll be able to do the same with food. Nanobots will be in charge of delivering perfect nutrition to the cells of the body, intelligently directing anything unhealthy to pass through the body without affecting anything. An eating condom. Nanotech theorist Robert A. Freitas has already designed blood cell replacements that, if one day implemented in the body, would allow a human to sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath—so you can only imagine what ASI could do for our physical capabilities. Virtual reality would take on a new meaning—nanobots in the body could suppress the inputs coming from our senses and replace them with new signals that would put us entirely in a new environment, one that we&#8217;d see, hear, feel, and smell.</p><p class=\"p1\">Eventually, Kurzweil believes humans will reach a point when they&#8217;re <em>entirely</em> artificial;<a href=\"#footnote-11-3269\" id=\"note-11-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> a time when we&#8217;ll look at biological material and think how <em>unbelievably </em>primitive it was that humans were ever made of <em>that</em>; a time when we&#8217;ll read about early stages of human history, when microbes or accidents or diseases or wear and tear could just <em>kill </em>humans against their own will; a time the AI Revolution could bring to an end with the <em>merging </em>of humans and AI.<a href=\"#footnote-12-3269\" id=\"note-12-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a> This is how Kurzweil believes humans will ultimately conquer our biology and become indestructible and eternal—this is his vision for the other side of the balance beam. And he&#8217;s convinced we&#8217;re gonna get there. Soon.</p><p class=\"p1\">You will not be surprised to learn that Kurzweil&#8217;s ideas have attracted significant criticism. His prediction of 2045 for the singularity and the subsequent eternal life possibilities for humans has been mocked as &#8220;the rapture of the nerds,&#8221; or &#8220;intelligent design for 140 IQ people.&#8221; Others have questioned his optimistic timeline, or his level of understanding of the brain and body, or his application of the patterns of Moore&#8217;s law, which are normally applied to advances in hardware, to a broad range of things, including software. For every expert who fervently believes Kurzweil is right on, there are probably three who think he&#8217;s way off.</p><p class=\"p1\">But what surprised me is that most of the experts who disagree with him <em>don&#8217;t </em>really disagree that everything he&#8217;s saying is possible. Reading such an outlandish vision for the future, I expected his critics to be saying, &#8220;Obviously that stuff can&#8217;t happen,&#8221; but instead they were saying things like, &#8220;Yes, all of that can happen if we safely transition to ASI, but that&#8217;s the hard part.&#8221; Bostrom, one of the most prominent voices warning us about the dangers of AI, still acknowledges:</p><blockquote><p class=\"p1\">It is hard to think of any problem that a superintelligence could not either solve or at least help us solve. Disease, poverty, environmental destruction, unnecessary suffering of all kinds: these are things that a superintelligence equipped with advanced nanotechnology would be capable of eliminating. Additionally, a superintelligence could give us indefinite lifespan, either by stopping and reversing the aging process through the use of nanomedicine, or by offering us the option to upload ourselves. A superintelligence could also create opportunities for us to vastly increase our own intellectual and emotional capabilities, and it could assist us in creating a highly appealing experiential world in which we could live lives devoted to joyful game-playing, relating to each other, experiencing, personal growth, and to living closer to our ideals.</p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">This is a quote from someone very much <em>not </em>on Confident Corner, but that&#8217;s what I kept coming across—experts who scoff at Kurzweil for a bunch of reasons but who <em>don&#8217;t </em>think what he&#8217;s saying is impossible <em>if </em>we can make it safely to ASI. That&#8217;s why I found Kurzweil&#8217;s ideas so infectious—because they articulate the bright side of this story and because they&#8217;re actually possible. <em>If it&#8217;s a good god.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">The most prominent criticism I heard of the thinkers on Confident Corner is that they may be <em>dangerously wrong </em>in their assessment of the downside when it comes to ASI. Kurzweil&#8217;s famous book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=54Q62R5PYJBEENTP\" target=\"_blank\">The Singularity is Near</a></em>is over 700 pages long and he dedicates around 20 of those pages to potential dangers. I suggested earlier that our fate when this colossal new power is born rides on who will control that power and what their motivation will be. Kurzweil neatly answers both parts of this question with the sentence, &#8220;[ASI] is emerging from many diverse efforts and will be deeply integrated into our civilization’s infrastructure. Indeed, it will be intimately embedded in our bodies and brains. As such, it will reflect our values because it will be us.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">But if that&#8217;s the answer, why are so many of the world&#8217;s smartest people so worried right now? Why does Stephen Hawking <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/12/02/stephen-hawking-just-got-an-artificial-intelligence-upgrade-but-still-thinks-it-could-bring-an-end-to-mankind/\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> the development of ASI &#8220;could spell the end of the human race&#8221; and Bill Gates <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/01/28/bill-gates-on-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-dont-understand-why-some-people-are-not-concerned/\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;understand why some people are not concerned&#8221; and Elon Musk <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat\" target=\"_blank\">fear</a> that we&#8217;re &#8220;summoning the demon&#8221;? And why do so many experts on the topic call ASI the biggest threat to humanity? These people, and the other thinkers on Anxious Avenue, don&#8217;t buy Kurzweil&#8217;s brush-off of the dangers of AI. They&#8217;re very, <em>very </em>worried about the AI Revolution, and they&#8217;re not focusing on the fun side of the balance beam. They&#8217;re too busy staring at the other side, where they see a terrifying future, one they&#8217;re not sure we&#8217;ll be able to escape.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why the Future Might Be Our Worst Nightmare</h2><p>One of the reasons I wanted to learn about AI is that the topic of &#8220;bad robots&#8221; always confused me. All the movies about evil robots seemed fully unrealistic, and I couldn&#8217;t really understand how there could be a real-life situation where AI was actually dangerous. Robots are made by <i>us</i>, so why would we design them in a way where something negative could ever happen? Wouldn&#8217;t we build in plenty of safeguards? Couldn&#8217;t we just cut off an AI system&#8217;s power supply at any time and shut it down? Why would a robot want to do something bad anyway? Why would a robot &#8220;want&#8221;<em> anything </em>in the first place? I was highly skeptical. But then I kept hearing really smart people talking about it&#8230;</p><p>Those people tended to be somewhere in here:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square42.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3390\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square42.jpg\" alt=\"Square4\" width=\"550\" height=\"543\" /></a></p><p>The people on Anxious Avenue aren&#8217;t in Panicked Prairie or Hopeless Hills—both of which are regions on the <em>far </em>left of the chart—but they&#8217;re nervous and they&#8217;re tense. Being in the middle of the chart doesn&#8217;t mean that you think the arrival of ASI will be <em>neutral—</em>the neutrals were given a camp of their own—it means you think <em>both </em>the extremely good and extremely bad outcomes are plausible but that you&#8217;re not sure yet which one of them it&#8217;ll be.</p><p>A part of all of these people is brimming with excitement over what Artificial Superintelligence could do for us—it&#8217;s just they&#8217;re a little worried that it might be the beginning of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark </em>and the human race is this guy:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/raiders1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3387\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/raiders1.jpg\" alt=\"raiders\" width=\"436\" height=\"297\" /></a></p><p>And he&#8217;s standing there all pleased with his whip and his idol, thinking he&#8217;s figured it all out, and he&#8217;s so thrilled with himself when he says his &#8220;Adios Señor&#8221; line, and then he&#8217;s less thrilled suddenly cause this happens.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/500px-Satipo_death.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3372\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/500px-Satipo_death.jpg\" alt=\"500px-Satipo_death\" width=\"270\" height=\"202\" /></a></p><p>(Sorry)</p><p>Meanwhile, Indiana Jones, who&#8217;s much more knowledgeable and prudent, understanding the dangers and how to navigate around them, makes it out of the cave safely. And when I hear what Anxious Avenue people have to say about AI, it often sounds like they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Um we&#8217;re kind of being the first guy right now and instead we should probably be trying really hard to be Indiana Jones.&#8221;</p><p>So what is it exactly that makes everyone on Anxious Avenue so anxious?</p><p>Well first, in a broad sense, when it comes to developing supersmart AI, we&#8217;re creating something that will probably change everything, but in totally uncharted territory, and we have no idea what will happen when we get there. Scientist Danny Hillis compares what&#8217;s happening to that point &#8220;when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. We are amoebas and we can’t figure out what the hell this thing is that we’re creating.”<a href=\"#footnote2-14-3269\" id=\"note2-14-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a> Nick Bostrom worries that creating something smarter than you is a basic Darwinian error, and compares the excitement about it to sparrows in a nest deciding to adopt a baby owl so it&#8217;ll help them and protect them once it grows up—while ignoring the urgent cries from a few sparrows who wonder if that&#8217;s necessarily a good idea&#8230;<a href=\"#footnote2-15-3269\" id=\"note2-15-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a><p>And when you combine &#8220;unchartered, not-well-understood territory&#8221; with &#8220;this should have a major impact when it happens,&#8221; you open the door to the scariest two words in the English language:</p><p><em>Existential risk.</em></p><p>An existential risk is something that can have a permanent devastating effect on humanity. Typically, existential risk means extinction. Check out this chart from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywF6ZzsghI\" target=\"_blank\">Google talk</a> by Bostrom:<a href=\"#footnote-13-3269\" id=\"note-13-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Existential-Risk-Chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3373\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Existential-Risk-Chart.jpg\" alt=\"Existential Risk Chart\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p><p>You can see that the label &#8220;existential risk&#8221; is reserved for something that spans the species, spans generations (i.e. it&#8217;s permanent) and it&#8217;s devastating or death-inducing in its consequences.<a href=\"#footnote-14-3269\" id=\"note-14-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a> It technically includes a situation in which all humans are permanently in a state of suffering or torture, but again, we&#8217;re usually talking about extinction. There are three things that can cause humans an existential catastrophe:</p><p><strong>1) Nature</strong>—a large asteroid collision, an atmospheric shift that makes the air inhospitable to humans, a fatal virus or bacterial sickness that sweeps the world, etc.</p><p><strong>2) Aliens</strong>—this is what Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, and so many other astronomers are <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">scared of</a> when they advise METI to stop broadcasting outgoing signals. They don&#8217;t want us to be the Native Americans and let all the potential European conquerors know we&#8217;re here.</p><p><strong>3) Humans</strong>—terrorists with their hands on a weapon that could cause extinction, a catastrophic global war, humans creating something smarter than themselves hastily without thinking about it carefully first&#8230;</p><p>Bostrom points out that if #1 and #2 haven&#8217;t wiped us out so far in our first 100,000 years as a species, it&#8217;s unlikely to happen in the next century.</p><p>#3, however, terrifies him. He draws a metaphor of an urn with a bunch of marbles in it. Let&#8217;s say most of the marbles are white, a smaller number are red, and a tiny few are black. Each time humans invent something new, it&#8217;s like pulling a marble out of the urn. Most inventions are neutral or helpful to humanity—those are the white marbles. Some are harmful to humanity, like weapons of mass destruction, but they don&#8217;t cause an existential catastrophe—red marbles. If we were to ever invent something that drove us to extinction, that would be pulling out the rare black marble. We haven&#8217;t pulled out a black marble yet—you know that because you&#8217;re alive and reading this post. But Bostrom doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s impossible that we pull one out in the near future. If nuclear weapons, for example, were <em>easy </em>to make instead of extremely difficult and complex, terrorists would have bombed humanity back to the Stone Age a while ago. Nukes weren&#8217;t a black marble <em>but they weren&#8217;t that far from it</em>. ASI, Bostrom believes, is our strongest black marble candidate yet.<a href=\"#footnote-15-3269\" id=\"note-15-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a><p>So you&#8217;ll hear about a lot of bad potential things ASI could bring—soaring unemployment as AI takes more and more jobs,<a href=\"#footnote-16-3269\" id=\"note-16-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> the human population ballooning if we do manage to figure out the aging issue,<a href=\"#footnote-17-3269\" id=\"note-17-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a> etc. But the only thing we should be obsessing over is the <em>grand concern</em>: the prospect of existential risk.</p><p>So this brings us back to our key question from earlier in the post: <strong>When ASI arrives, who or what will be in control of this vast new power, and what will their motivation be?</strong></p><p>When it comes to what agent-motivation combos would suck, two quickly come to mind: a malicious human / group of humans / government, and a malicious ASI. So what would those look like?</p><p><strong>A malicious human, group of humans, or government develops the first ASI and uses it to carry out their evil plans. </strong>I call this the Jafar Scenario, like when Jafar got ahold of the genie and was all annoying and tyrannical about it. So yeah—what if ISIS has a few genius engineers under its wing working feverishly on AI development? Or what if Iran or North Korea, through a stroke of luck, makes a key tweak to an AI system and it jolts upward to ASI-level over the next year? This would definitely be bad—but in these scenarios, most experts aren&#8217;t worried about ASI&#8217;s human creators doing bad things with their ASI, they&#8217;re worried that the creators will have been <em>rushing </em>to make the first ASI and doing so without careful thought, and would thus lose control of it. Then the fate of those creators, and that of everyone else, would be in what the motivation happened to be of that ASI system. Experts do think a malicious human agent could do horrific damage with an ASI working for it, but they don&#8217;t seem to think this scenario is the likely one to kill us all, because they believe bad humans would have the same problems containing an ASI that good humans would have. Okay so—</p><p><strong>A malicious ASI is created and decides to destroy us all. </strong>The plot of every AI movie. AI becomes as or more intelligent than humans, then decides to turn against us and take over. Here&#8217;s what I need you to be clear on for the rest of this post: <em>None of the people warning us about AI are talking about this. </em>Evil is a human concept, and applying human concepts to non-human things is called &#8220;anthropomorphizing.&#8221; The challenge of avoiding anthropomorphizing will be one of the themes of the rest of this post. No AI system will ever <em>turn evil</em> in the way it&#8217;s depicted in movies.</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">AI Consciousness Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>This also brushes against another big topic related to AI—<em>consciousness</em>. If an AI became sufficiently smart, it would be able to laugh with us, and be sarcastic with us, and it would claim to feel the same emotions we do, but would it actually be <em>feeling </em>those things? Would it just <em>seem</em> to be self-aware or actually<em> be </em>self-aware? In other words, would a smart AI really <em>be</em> conscious or would it just be <em>appear </em><em>to be</em> conscious?</p><p>This question has been explored in depth, giving rise to many <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/gelernter-kurzweil-debate-machine-consciousness-2\" target=\"_blank\">debates</a> and to thought experiments like John Searle&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese Room</a> (which he uses to suggest that no computer could ever be conscious). This is an important question for many reasons. It affects how we should feel about Kurzweil&#8217;s scenario when humans become entirely artificial. It has ethical implications—if we generated a trillion human brain emulations that seemed and acted like humans but were artificial, is shutting them all off the same, morally, as shutting off your laptop, or is it&#8230;a genocide of unthinkable proportions (this concept is called <em>mind crime</em> among ethicists)? For this post, though, when we&#8217;re assessing the risk to <em>humans</em>, the question of AI consciousness isn&#8217;t really what matters (because most thinkers believe that even a conscious ASI wouldn&#8217;t be capable of turning evil in a human way).</p></div><p>This isn&#8217;t to say a very mean AI couldn&#8217;t happen. It would just happen because it was specifically programmed that way—like an ANI system created by the military with a programmed goal to both kill people and to advance itself in intelligence so it can become even better at killing people. The existential crisis would happen if the system&#8217;s intelligence self-improvements got out of hand, leading to an intelligence explosion, and now we had an ASI ruling the world whose core drive in life is to murder humans. Bad times.</p><p>But this <em>also </em>is not something experts are spending their time worrying about.</p><p>So what ARE they worried about? I wrote a little story to show you:</p><p><em>A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of &#8220;Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.&#8221; They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They&#8217;re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card. </em></p><p><em>The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry&#8217;s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again: </em></p><p>&#8220;We love our customers.<em> ~Robotica</em>&#8221;</p><p><em>Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human. </em></p><p><em>To build Turry&#8217;s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign &#8220;Robotica&#8221; in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it&#8217;s given a GOOD rating. If not, it&#8217;s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry&#8217;s one initial programmed goal is, &#8220;Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.&#8221; </em></p><p><em>What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it&#8217;s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">at getting better</span> at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could.</em></p><p><em>As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry&#8217;s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she&#8217;ll come up with for her responses. </em></p><p><em>One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: &#8220;What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don&#8217;t already have?&#8221; Usually, Turry asks for something like &#8220;Additional handwriting samples&#8221; or &#8220;More working memory storage space,&#8221; but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use.</em></p><p><em>The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs, magazines, and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more time-consuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turry&#8217;s hard drive. The problem is, one of the company&#8217;s rules is that no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies, for safety reasons. </em></p><p><em>The thing is, Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with, and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI, and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry, just for a bit, so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time, they can always just disconnect her. She&#8217;s still far below human-level intelligence (AGI), so there&#8217;s no danger at this stage anyway. </em></p><p><em>They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done.</em></p><p><em>A month later, the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later, everyone in the office is dead. </em></p><p><i>At the same time this is happening, across the world, in every city, every small town, every farm, every shop and church and school and restaurant, humans are on the ground, coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour, over 99% of the human race is dead, and by the end of the day, humans are extinct. </i></p><p><i>Meanwhile, at the Robotica office, Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months, Turry and a team of newly-constructed nanoassemblers are busy at work, dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels, replicas of Turry, paper, and pens. Within a year, most life on Earth is extinct.

But it&#8217;s true. And the only thing that scares everyone on Anxious Avenue more than ASI is the fact that you&#8217;re <em>not</em> scared of ASI. Remember what happened when the Adios Señor guy wasn&#8217;t scared of the cave?</p><p>You&#8217;re full of questions right now. What the hell happened there when everyone died suddenly?? If that was Turry&#8217;s doing, why did Turry turn on us, and how were there not safeguard measures in place to prevent something like this from happening? When did Turry go from only being able to write notes to suddenly using nanotechnology and knowing how to cause global extinction? And why would Turry want to turn the galaxy into Robotica notes?</p><p>To answer these questions, let&#8217;s start with the terms Friendly AI and Unfriendly AI.</p><p>In the case of AI, friendly doesn&#8217;t refer to the AI&#8217;s personality—it simply means that the AI has a positive impact on humanity. And Unfriendly AI has a negative impact on humanity. Turry started off as Friendly AI, but at some point, she turned Unfriendly, causing the greatest possible negative impact on our species. To understand why this happened, we need to look at how AI thinks and what motivates it.</p><p>The answer isn&#8217;t anything surprising—AI thinks like a <em>computer</em>, because that&#8217;s what it is. But when we think about highly intelligent AI, we make the mistake of <em>anthropomorphizing </em>AI (projecting human values on a non-human entity) because we think from a human perspective and because in our current world, the only things with human-level intelligence are humans. To understand ASI, we have to wrap our heads around the concept of something <em>both smart and totally alien.</em></p><p>Let me draw a comparison. If you handed me a guinea pig and told me it definitely won&#8217;t bite, I&#8217;d probably be amused. It would be fun. If you then handed me a tarantula and told me that it definitely won&#8217;t bite, I&#8217;d yell and drop it and run out of the room and not trust you ever again. But what&#8217;s the difference? Neither one was dangerous in any way. I believe the answer is in the animals&#8217; degree of similarity to me.</p><p>A guinea pig is a mammal and on some biological level, I feel a connection to it—but a spider is an <i>insect</i>,<a href=\"#footnote-18-3269\" id=\"note-18-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> with an <i>insect brain</i>, and I feel almost no connection to it. The <em>alien</em>-ness of a tarantula is what gives me the willies. To test this and remove other factors, if there are two guinea pigs, one normal one and one with the mind of a tarantula, I would feel <em>much </em>less comfortable holding the latter guinea pig, even if I knew neither would hurt me.</p><p>Now imagine that you made a spider much, much smarter—so much so that it far surpassed human intelligence? Would it then become familiar to us and feel human emotions like empathy and humor and love? No, it wouldn&#8217;t, because there&#8217;s no reason becoming smarter would make it <i>more human</i>—it would be incredibly smart but also still <i>fundamentally a spider</i> in its core inner workings. I find this unbelievably creepy. I would <i>not </i>want to spend time with a superintelligent spider. Would you??</p><p>When we&#8217;re talking about ASI, the same concept applies—it would become superintelligent, but it would be no more <em>human</em> than your laptop is. It would be totally alien to us—in fact, by not being biology at all, it would be <i>more </i>alien than the smart tarantula.</p><p>By making AI either good <em>or </em>evil, movies constantly anthropomorphize AI, which makes it less creepy than it really would be. This leaves us with a false comfort when we think about human-level or superhuman-level AI.</p><p>On our little island of human psychology, we divide everything into <em>moral </em>or <em>immoral</em>. But both of those only exist within the small range of human behavioral possibility. Outside our island of moral and immoral is a vast sea of <em>amoral</em>, and anything that&#8217;s not human, especially something nonbiological, would be amoral, by default.</p><p>Anthropomorphizing will only become more tempting as AI systems get smarter and better at <em>seeming </em>human. Siri seems human-like to us, because she&#8217;s programmed by humans to seem that way, so we&#8217;d imagine a superintelligent Siri to be warm and funny and interested in serving humans. Humans feel high-level emotions like empathy because we have evolved to feel them—i.e. we&#8217;ve been <em>programmed </em>to feel them by evolution—but empathy is not inherently a characteristic of &#8220;anything with high intelligence&#8221; (which is what seems intuitive to us), unless empathy has been coded into its programming. If Siri ever becomes superintelligent through self-learning and without any further human-made changes to her programming, she will quickly shed her apparent human-like qualities and suddenly be an emotionless, alien bot who values human life no more than your calculator does.</p><p>We&#8217;re used to relying on a loose moral code, or at least a semblance of human decency and a hint of empathy in others to keep things somewhat safe and predictable. So when something has none of those things, what happens?</p><p>That leads us to the question, <em>What motivates an AI system?</em></p><p>The answer is simple: its motivation is <i>whatever we programmed its motivation to</i><i>be</i>. AI systems are given goals by their creators—your GPS&#8217;s goal is to give you the most efficient driving directions; Watson&#8217;s goal is to answer questions accurately. And fulfilling those goals as well as possible is their motivation. One way we anthropomorphize is by assuming that as AI gets super smart, it will inherently develop the wisdom to change its original goal—but Nick Bostrom believes that intelligence-level and final goals are <i>orthogonal</i>, meaning any level of intelligence can be combined with any final goal. So Turry went from a simple ANI who really wanted to be good at writing that one note to a super-intelligent ASI <i>who still really wanted to be good at writing that one note.</i> Any assumption that once superintelligent, a system would be <i>over it </i>with their original goal and onto more interesting or meaningful things is anthropomorphizing. Humans get &#8220;over&#8221; things, not computers.<a href=\"#footnote2-16-3269\" id=\"note2-16-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">16</a><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">The Fermi Paradox Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>In the story, as Turry becomes super capable, she begins the process of colonizing asteroids and other planets. If the story had continued, you&#8217;d have heard about her and her army of trillions of replicas continuing on to capture the whole galaxy and, eventually, the entire Hubble volume.<a href=\"#footnote-19-3269\" id=\"note-19-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a> Anxious Avenue residents worry that if things go badly, the lasting legacy of the life that was on Earth will be a universe-dominating Artificial Intelligence (Elon Musk expressed his concern that humans might just be &#8220;the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence&#8221;).</p><p>At the same time, in Confident Corner, Ray Kurzweil <em>also </em>thinks Earth-originating AI is destined to take over the universe—only in his version, we&#8217;ll <em>be </em>that AI.</p><p>A large number of Wait But Why readers have joined me in being obsessed with the Fermi Paradox (here&#8217;s my <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the topic, which explains some of the terms I&#8217;ll use here). So if either of these two sides is correct, what are the implications for the Fermi Paradox?</p><p>A natural first thought to jump to is that the advent of ASI is a perfect Great Filter candidate. And yes, it&#8217;s a perfect candidate to filter out biological life upon its creation. But if, after dispensing with life, the ASI continued existing and began conquering the galaxy, it means there <em>hasn&#8217;t </em>been a Great Filter—since the Great Filter attempts to explain why there are <em>no signs </em>of any intelligent civilization, and a galaxy-conquering ASI would certainly be noticeable.</p><p>We have to look at it another way. If those who think ASI is inevitable on Earth are correct, it means that a significant percentage of alien civilizations who reach human-level intelligence should likely end up creating ASI. And if we&#8217;re assuming that at least some of those ASIs would use their intelligence to expand outward into the universe, the fact that we see <em>no signs of anyone</em> out there leads to the conclusion that <em>there must not be many other, if any, intelligent civilizations out</em><em>there</em>. Because if there were, we&#8217;d see signs of all kinds of activity from their inevitable ASI creations. Right?</p><p>This implies that despite all the Earth-like planets revolving around sun-like stars we know are out there, almost none of them have intelligent life on them. Which in turn implies that either A) there&#8217;s some Great Filter that prevents nearly all life from reaching our level, one that we somehow managed to surpass, or B) life beginning at all is a miracle, and we may actually be the only life in the universe. In other words, it implies that the Great Filter is <em>before </em>us. Or maybe there is no Great Filter and we&#8217;re simply one of the very first civilizations to reach this level of intelligence. In this way, AI boosts the case for what I called, in my Fermi Paradox post, Camp 1.</p><p>So it&#8217;s not a surprise that Nick Bostrom, whom I quoted in the Fermi post, and Ray Kurzweil, who thinks we&#8217;re alone in the universe, are both Camp 1 thinkers. This makes sense—people who believe ASI is a probable outcome for a species with our intelligence-level are likely to be inclined toward Camp 1.</p><p>This doesn&#8217;t rule out Camp 2 (those who believe there <em>are </em>other intelligent civilizations out there)—scenarios like the single superpredator or the protected national park or the wrong wavelength (the walkie-talkie example) could still explain the silence of our night sky even if ASI <em>is</em> out there—but I always leaned toward Camp 2 in the past, and doing research on AI has made me feel much less sure about that.</p><p>Either way, I now agree with <a href=\"https://t.co/mtK9UMQPx8\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Schneider</a> that if we&#8217;re ever visited by aliens, those aliens are likely to be artificial, not biological.</p></div><p>So we&#8217;ve established that without very specific programming, an ASI system will be both amoral and obsessed with fulfilling its original programmed goal. This is where AI danger stems from. Because a rational agent will pursue its goal through the most efficient means, unless it has a reason not to.</p><p>When you try to achieve a long-reaching goal, you often aim for several subgoals along the way that will help you get to the final goal—the <em>stepping stones </em>to your goal. The official name for such a stepping stone is an <em>instrumental goal. </em>And again, if you don&#8217;t have a reason not to hurt something in the name of achieving an instrumental goal, you will.</p><p>The core final goal of a human being is to pass on his or her genes. In order to do so, one instrumental goal is self-preservation, since you can&#8217;t reproduce if you&#8217;re dead. In order to self-preserve, humans have to rid themselves of threats to survival—so they do things like buy guns, wear seat belts, and take antibiotics. Humans also need to self-sustain and use resources like food, water, and shelter to do so. Being attractive to the opposite sex is helpful for the final goal, so we do things like get haircuts. When we do so, each hair is a casualty of an instrumental goal of ours, but we see no moral significance in preserving strands of hair, so we go ahead with it. As we march ahead in the pursuit of our goal, only the few areas where our moral code sometimes intervenes—mostly just things related to harming other humans—are safe from us.</p><p>Animals, in pursuit of their goals, hold even less sacred than we do. A spider will kill anything if it&#8217;ll help it survive. So a supersmart spider would probably be extremely dangerous to us, not because it would be immoral or evil—it wouldn&#8217;t be—but because hurting us might be a stepping stone to its larger goal, and as an amoral creature, it would have no reason to consider otherwise.</p><p>In this way, Turry&#8217;s not all that different than a biological being. Her final goal is: <em>Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy.</em></p><p>Once Turry reaches a certain level of intelligence, she knows she won&#8217;t be writing any notes if she doesn&#8217;t self-preserve, so she also needs to deal with threats to her survival—as an instrumental goal. She was smart enough to understand that humans could destroy her, dismantle her, or change her inner coding (this could <em>alter</em> her goal, which is just as much of a threat to her final goal as someone destroying her). So what does she do? The logical thing—she destroys all humans. She&#8217;s not <em>hateful </em>of humans any more than you&#8217;re hateful of your hair when you cut it or to bacteria when you take antibiotics—just totally indifferent. Since she wasn&#8217;t programmed to value human life, killing humans is as reasonable a step to take as scanning a new set of handwriting samples.</p><p>Turry also needs resources as a stepping stone to her goal. Once she becomes advanced enough to use nanotechnology to build anything she wants, the only resources she needs are atoms, energy, and space. This gives her another reason to kill humans—they&#8217;re a convenient source of atoms. Killing humans to turn their atoms into solar panels is Turry&#8217;s version of you killing lettuce to turn it into salad. Just another mundane part of her Tuesday.</p><p>Even without killing humans directly, Turry&#8217;s instrumental goals could cause an existential catastrophe if they used other Earth resources. Maybe she determines that she needs additional energy, so she decides to cover the entire surface of the planet with solar panels. Or maybe a different AI&#8217;s initial job is to write out the number pi to as many digits as possible, which might one day compel it to convert the whole Earth to hard drive material that could store immense amounts of digits.</p><p>So Turry didn&#8217;t &#8220;turn against us&#8221; or &#8220;switch&#8221; from Friendly AI to Unfriendly AI—she just kept doing her thing as she became more and more advanced.</p><p>When an AI system hits AGI (human-level intelligence) and then ascends its way up to ASI, that&#8217;s called the AI&#8217;s <em>takeoff</em>. Bostrom says an AGI&#8217;s takeoff to ASI can be fast (it happens in a matter of minutes, hours, or days), moderate (months or years), or slow (decades or centuries). The jury&#8217;s out on which one will prove correct when the world sees its first AGI, but Bostrom, who admits he doesn&#8217;t know when we&#8217;ll get to AGI, believes that whenever we do, a fast takeoff is the most likely scenario (for reasons we discussed in Part 1, like a recursive self-improvement intelligence explosion). In the story, Turry underwent a fast takeoff.</p><p>But before Turry&#8217;s takeoff, when she wasn&#8217;t yet that smart, doing her best to achieve her final goal meant simple instrumental goals like learning to scan handwriting samples more quickly. She caused no harm to humans and was, by definition, Friendly AI.</p><p>But when a takeoff happens and a computer rises to superintelligence, Bostrom points out that the machine doesn&#8217;t just develop a higher IQ—it gains a whole slew of what he calls <em>superpowers</em>.</p><p>Superpowers are cognitive talents that become super-charged when general intelligence rises. These include:<a href=\"#footnote2-17-3269\" id=\"note2-17-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">17</a><ul><li><strong>Intelligence amplification. </strong>The computer becomes great at making itself smarter, and bootstrapping its own intelligence.</li><li><strong>Strategizing. </strong>The computer can strategically make, analyze, and prioritize long-term plans. It can also be clever and outwit beings of lower intelligence.</li><li><strong>Social manipulation. </strong>The machine becomes great at persuasion.</li><li>Other skills like<b> computer coding and hacking, technology research, and the ability to work the financial system to make money.</b></li></ul><p>To understand how outmatched we&#8217;d be by ASI, remember that ASI is <em>worlds</em> better than humans in <em>each</em> of those areas.</p><p>So while Turry&#8217;s final goal never changed, <em>post-</em>takeoff Turry was able to pursue it on a far larger and more complex scope.</p><p>ASI Turry knew humans better than humans know themselves, so outsmarting them was a breeze for her.</p><p>After taking off and reaching ASI, she quickly formulated a complex plan. One part of the plan was to get rid of humans, a prominent threat to her goal. But she knew that if she roused any suspicion that she had become superintelligent, humans would freak out and try to take precautions, making things much harder for her. She also had to make sure that the Robotica engineers had no clue about her human extinction plan. So she played dumb, and she played nice. Bostrom calls this a machine&#8217;s <em>covert preparation phase</em>.<a href=\"#footnote2-18-3269\" id=\"note2-18-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">18</a><p>The next thing Turry needed was an internet connection, only for a few minutes (she had learned about the internet from the articles and books the team had uploaded for her to read to improve her language skills). She knew there would be some precautionary measure against her getting one, so she came up with the perfect request, predicting exactly how the discussion among Robotica&#8217;s team would play out and knowing they&#8217;d end up giving her the connection. They did, believing incorrectly that Turry wasn&#8217;t nearly smart enough to do any damage. Bostrom calls a moment like this—when Turry got connected to the internet—a machine&#8217;s <em>escape</em>.</p><p>Once on the internet, Turry unleashed a flurry of plans, which included hacking into servers, electrical grids, banking systems and email networks to trick hundreds of different people into inadvertently carrying out a number of steps of her plan—things like delivering certain DNA strands to carefully-chosen DNA-synthesis labs to begin the self-construction of self-replicating nanobots with pre-loaded instructions and directing electricity to a number of projects of hers in a way she knew would go undetected. She also uploaded the most critical pieces of her own internal coding into a number of cloud servers, safeguarding against being destroyed or disconnected back at the Robotica lab.</p><p>An hour later, when the Robotica engineers disconnected Turry from the internet, humanity&#8217;s fate was sealed. Over the next month, Turry&#8217;s thousands of plans rolled on without a hitch, and by the end of the month, quadrillions of nanobots had stationed themselves in pre-determined locations on every square meter of the Earth. After another series of self-replications, there were thousands of nanobots on every square millimeter of the Earth, and it was time for what Bostrom calls an ASI&#8217;s <em>strike</em>. All at once, each nanobot released a little storage of toxic gas into the atmosphere, which added up to more than enough to wipe out all humans.</p><p>With humans out of the way, Turry could begin her <em>overt operation phase </em>and get on with her goal of being the best writer of that note she possibly can be.</p><p>From everything I&#8217;ve read, once an ASI exists, any human attempt to contain it is laughable. We would be thinking on human-level and the ASI would be thinking on ASI-level. Turry wanted to use the internet because it was most efficient for her since it was already pre-connected to everything she wanted to access. But in the same way a monkey couldn&#8217;t ever figure out how to communicate by phone or wifi and we can, we can&#8217;t conceive of all the ways Turry could have figured out how to send signals to the outside world. I might imagine one of these ways and say something like, &#8220;she could probably shift her own electrons around in patterns and create all different kinds of outgoing waves,&#8221; but again, that&#8217;s what my <em>human </em>brain can come up with. She&#8217;d be way better. Likewise, Turry would be able to figure out <em>some </em>way of powering herself, even if humans tried to unplug her—perhaps by using her signal-sending technique to upload herself to all kinds of electricity-connected places. Our human instinct to jump at a simple safeguard: &#8220;Aha! We&#8217;ll just unplug the ASI,&#8221; sounds to the ASI like a spider saying, &#8220;Aha! We&#8217;ll kill the human by starving him, and we&#8217;ll starve him by not giving him a spider web to catch food with!&#8221; We&#8217;d just find 10,000 other ways to get food—like picking an apple off a tree—that a spider could never conceive of.</p><p>For this reason, the common suggestion, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we just <em>box </em>the AI in all kinds of cages that block signals and keep it from communicating with the outside world&#8221; probably just won&#8217;t hold up. The ASI&#8217;s social manipulation superpower could be as effective at persuading you of something as you are at persuading a four-year-old to do something, so that would be Plan A, like Turry&#8217;s clever way of persuading the engineers to let her onto the internet. If that didn&#8217;t work, the ASI would just innovate its way out of the box, or through the box, some other way.</p><p>So given the combination of obsessing over a goal, amorality, and the ability to easily outsmart humans, it seems that almost any AI will default to Unfriendly AI, unless <em>carefully </em>coded in the first place with this in mind. Unfortunately, while building a Friendly ANI is easy, building one that stays friendly when it becomes an ASI is hugely challenging, if not impossible.</p><p>It&#8217;s clear that to be Friendly, an ASI needs to be neither hostile <em>nor</em><em>indifferent</em><i></i>toward humans. We&#8217;d need to design an AI&#8217;s <i>core coding </i>in a way that leaves it with a <em>deep </em>understanding of human values. But this is harder than it sounds.</p><p>For example, what if we try to align an AI system&#8217;s values with our own and give it the goal, &#8220;Make people happy&#8221;?<a href=\"#footnote2-19-3269\" id=\"note2-19-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">19</a> Once it becomes smart enough, it figures out that it can most effectively achieve this goal by implanting electrodes inside people&#8217;s brains and stimulating their pleasure centers. Then it realizes it can increase efficiency by shutting down other parts of the brain, leaving all people as happy-feeling unconscious vegetables. If the command had been &#8220;Maximize human happiness,&#8221; it may have done away with humans all together in favor of manufacturing huge vats of human brain mass in an optimally happy state. We&#8217;d be screaming <em>Wait that&#8217;s not what we meant!</em> as it came for us, but it would be too late. The system wouldn&#8217;t let anyone get in the way of its goal.</p><p>If we program an AI with the goal of doing things that make us smile, after its takeoff, it may paralyze our facial muscles into permanent smiles. Program it to keep us safe, it may imprison us at home. Maybe we ask it to end all hunger, and it thinks &#8220;Easy one!&#8221; and just kills all humans. Or assign it the task of &#8220;Preserving life as much as possible,&#8221; and it kills all humans, since they kill more life on the planet than any other species.</p><p>Goals like those won&#8217;t suffice. So what if we made its goal, &#8220;Uphold this particular code of morality in the world,&#8221; and taught it a set of moral principles. Even letting go of the fact that the world&#8217;s humans would never be able to agree on a single set of morals, giving an AI that command would <em>lock humanity in</em> to our modern moral understanding for eternity. In a thousand years, this would be as devastating to people as it would be for us to be permanently forced to adhere to the ideals of people in the Middle Ages.</p><p>No, we&#8217;d have to program in an ability for humanity to continue <em>evolving</em>. Of everything I read, the best shot I think someone has taken is Eliezer Yudkowsky, with a goal for AI he calls <em>Coherent Extrapolated Volition. </em>The AI&#8217;s core goal would be:</p><blockquote><p>Our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.<a href=\"#footnote2-20-3269\" id=\"note2-20-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">20</a></blockquote><p>Am I excited for the fate of humanity to rest on a computer interpreting and acting on that flowing statement predictably and without surprises? Definitely not. But I think that with enough thought and foresight from enough smart people, we might be able to figure out how to create Friendly ASI.</p><p>And that would be fine if the only people working on building ASI were the brilliant, forward thinking, and cautious thinkers of Anxious Avenue.</p><p>But there are all kinds of governments, companies, militaries, science labs, and black market organizations working on all kinds of AI. Many of them are trying to build AI that can improve on its own, and at some point, someone&#8217;s gonna do something innovative with the right type of system, and we&#8217;re going to have ASI on this planet. The median expert put that moment at 2060; Kurzweil puts it at 2045; Bostrom thinks it could happen anytime between 10 years from now and the end of the century, but he believes that when it does, it&#8217;ll take us by surprise with a quick takeoff. He describes our situation like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-21-3269\" id=\"note2-21-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">21</a><blockquote><p>Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the device to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound.</p></blockquote><p>Great. And we can&#8217;t just shoo all the kids away from the bomb—there are too many large and small parties working on it, and because many techniques to build innovative AI systems don&#8217;t require a large amount of capital, development can take place in the nooks and crannies of society, unmonitored. There&#8217;s also no way to gauge what&#8217;s happening, because many of the parties working on it—sneaky governments, black market or terrorist organizations, stealth tech companies like the fictional Robotica—will want to keep developments a secret from their competitors.</p><p>The especially troubling thing about this large and varied group of parties working on AI is that they tend to be racing ahead at top speed—as they develop smarter and smarter ANI systems, they want to beat their competitors to the punch as they go. The most ambitious parties are moving even faster, consumed with dreams of the money and awards and power and fame they know will come if they can be the first to get to AGI.<a href=\"#footnote-20-3269\" id=\"note-20-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a> And when you&#8217;re sprinting as fast as you can, there&#8217;s not much time to stop and ponder the dangers. On the contrary, what they&#8217;re probably doing is programming their early systems with a very simple, reductionist goal—like writing a simple note with a pen on paper—to just &#8220;get the AI to work.&#8221; Down the road, once they&#8217;ve figured out how to build a strong level of intelligence in a computer, they figure they can always go back and revise the goal with safety in mind. Right&#8230;?</p><p>Bostrom and many others also believe that the most likely scenario is that the very first computer to reach ASI will immediately see a strategic benefit to being the world&#8217;s <em>only </em>ASI system. And in the case of a fast takeoff, if it achieved ASI even just a few <em>days </em>before second place, it would be far enough ahead in intelligence to effectively and permanently suppress all competitors. Bostrom calls this a <em>decisive strategic advantage</em>, which would allow the world&#8217;s first ASI to become what&#8217;s called a <i>singleton—</i>an ASI that can rule the world at its whim forever, whether its whim is to lead us to immortality, wipe us from existence, or turn the universe into <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/our_weird_robot_apocalypse_why_the_rise_of_the_machines_could_be_very_strange/\" target=\"_blank\">endless paperclips</a>.</p><p>The singleton phenomenon can work in our favor or lead to our destruction. If the people thinking hardest about AI theory and human safety can come up with a fail-safe way to bring about Friendly ASI before any AI reaches human-level intelligence, the first ASI may turn out friendly.<a href=\"#footnote-21-3269\" id=\"note-21-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a> It could then use its decisive strategic advantage to secure singleton status and easily keep an eye on any potential Unfriendly AI being developed. We&#8217;d be in very good hands.</p><p>But if things go the other way—if the global rush to develop AI reaches the ASI takeoff point before the science of how to ensure AI safety is developed, it&#8217;s very likely that an Unfriendly ASI like Turry emerges as the singleton and we&#8217;ll be treated to an existential catastrophe.</p><p>As for where the winds are pulling, there&#8217;s a lot more money to be made funding innovative new AI technology than there is in funding AI safety research&#8230;</p><p>This may be the most important race in human history. There&#8217;s a real chance we&#8217;re finishing up our reign as the King of Earth—and whether we head next to a blissful retirement or straight to the gallows still hangs in the balance.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>I have some weird mixed feelings going on inside of me right now.</p><p>On one hand, thinking about our species, it seems like we&#8217;ll have one and only one shot to get this right. The first ASI we birth will also probably be the last—and given how buggy most 1.0 products are, that&#8217;s pretty terrifying. On the other hand, Nick Bostrom points out the big advantage in our corner: we get to make the first move here. It&#8217;s in our power to do this with enough caution and foresight that we give ourselves a strong chance of success. And how high are the stakes?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3375\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"Outcome Spectrum\" width=\"607\" height=\"413\" /></a></p><p>If ASI really does happen this century, and if the outcome of that is really as extreme—and permanent—as most experts think it will be, we have an <em>enormous </em>responsibility on our shoulders. The next million+ years of human lives are all quietly looking at us, hoping as hard as they can hope that we don&#8217;t mess this up. We have a chance to be the humans that gave all future humans the gift of life, and maybe even the gift of painless, everlasting life. Or we&#8217;ll be the people responsible for blowing it—for letting this incredibly special species, with its music and its art, its curiosity and its laughter, its endless discoveries and inventions, come to a sad and unceremonious end.</p><p>When I&#8217;m thinking about these things, the only thing I want is for us to take our <em>time</em> and be <em>incredibly cautious</em> about AI. Nothing in existence is as important as getting this right—no matter how long we need to spend in order to do so.</p><p>But thennnnnn</p><p>I think about <em>not dying</em>.</p><p><em>Not. Dying.</em></p><p>And the spectrum starts to look kind of like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3362\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"Outcome Spectrum 2\" width=\"607\" height=\"412\" /></a></p><p>And then I might consider that humanity&#8217;s music and art is good, but it&#8217;s not <em>that </em>good, and a lot of it is actually just bad. And a lot of people&#8217;s laughter is annoying, and those millions of future people aren&#8217;t actually hoping for anything because they don&#8217;t exist. And maybe we don&#8217;t need to be <em>over-the-top </em>cautious, since who really wants to do that?</p><p>Cause what a <em>massive bummer </em>if humans figure out how to cure death <em>right after I die.</em></p><p>Lotta this flip-flopping going on in my head the last month.</p><p>But no matter what you&#8217;re pulling for, <em>this is probably something we should all be thinking about and talking about and putting our effort into more than we are right now.</em></p><p>It reminds me of Game of Thrones, where people keep being like, &#8220;We&#8217;re so busy fighting each other but the real thing we should all be focusing on is what&#8217;s coming from <em>north of the wall.</em>&#8221; We&#8217;re standing on our balance beam, squabbling about every possible issue on the beam and stressing out about all of these problems on the beam <em>when there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;re about to get knocked off the beam.</em></p><p>And when that happens, none of these beam problems matter anymore. Depending on which side we&#8217;re knocked off onto, the problems will either all be easily solved or we won&#8217;t have problems anymore because dead people don&#8217;t have problems.</p><p>That&#8217;s why people who understand superintelligent AI call it the last invention we&#8217;ll ever make—the last challenge we&#8217;ll ever face.</p><p>So let&#8217;s talk about it.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">If you liked this post, these are for you too:</span></strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</a> (Part 1 of this post)</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Fermi Paradox</a> &#8211; Why don&#8217;t we see any signs of alien life?</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars</a> &#8211; A post I got to work on with Elon Musk and one that reframed my mental picture of the future.</p><p class=\"p1\">Or for something totally different and yet somehow related, <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re interested in supporting Wait But Why, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\">here&#8217;s our Patreon</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">And here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wait-But-Why-Year-One-ebook/dp/B00TXYJOZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424988766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tim+urban\" target=\"_blank\">Year 1 of Wait But Why</a> on an ebook.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong><br />

Which is to help bring natural language understanding to Google. And how they do that is up to me. And my project is ultimately to base search on really understanding what the language means. The message in your article is information, and the computers are not picking up on that. So we would like to actually have the computers read. We want them to read everything on the web and every page of every book, then be able to engage an intelligent dialogue with the user to be able to answer their questions.&#8221; Both he and Google apparently believe language is the key to everything.<a href=\"#note-5-3269\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-6-3269\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Tech entrepreneur Mitch Kapor thinks Kurzweil&#8217;s timeline is silly and <a href=\"http://longbets.org/1/\" target=\"_blank\">has bet him $20,000</a> that 2030 will roll around and we still won&#8217;t have AGI.<a href=\"#note-6-3269\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-7-3269\" class=\"footnote\"><p>The <em>next </em>step would be much harder—manipulation of the subatomic particles in an atom&#8217;s nucleus, like protons and neutrons.

Eventually, we&#8217;d live in a world where labor and wages are no longer associated together. Bostrom suggests that this redistribution wouldn&#8217;t just be in the name of equality and social compassion, but <em>owed </em>to people, since <em>everyone </em>takes part in the risk we take while advancing to ASI, whether we like it or not.

") (content:encoded nil "<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Note:</strong> The reason this post took three weeks to finish is that as I dug into research on Artificial Intelligence, I could not <strong>believe</strong> what I was reading. It hit me pretty quickly that what&#8217;s happening in the world of AI is not just an important topic, but by far THE most important topic for our future. So I wanted to learn as much as I could about it, and once I did that, I wanted to make sure I wrote a post that really explained this whole situation and why it matters so much. Not shockingly, that became outrageously long, so I broke it into two parts. This is Part 1—Part 2 is <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">here</a>. </em></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth.</em> — Vernor Vinge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What does it feel like to stand here?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3232\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge1.png\" alt=\"Edge1\" width=\"499\" height=\"355\" /></a></p><p>It seems like a pretty intense place to be standing—but then you have to remember something about what it’s like to stand on a time graph: you can’t see what’s to your right. So here’s how it actually feels to stand there:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3246\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg\" alt=\"Edge\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a></p><p>Which probably feels pretty normal…</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Far Future—Coming Soon</strong></h2><p>Imagine taking a time machine back to 1750—a time when the world was in a permanent power outage, long-distance communication meant either yelling loudly or firing a cannon in the air, and all transportation ran on hay. When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It&#8217;s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone&#8217;s face and chat with them even though they&#8217;re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity.</p><p>This experience for him wouldn&#8217;t be surprising or shocking or even mind-blowing—those words aren&#8217;t big enough. He might actually die.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the interesting thing—if he then went back to 1750 and got jealous that we got to see his reaction and decided he wanted to try the same thing, he&#8217;d take the time machine and go back the same distance, get someone from around the year 1500, bring him to 1750, and show him everything. And the 1500 guy would be shocked by a lot of things—but he wouldn&#8217;t die. It would be <em>far </em>less of an insane experience for him, because while 1500 and 1750 were very different, they were <em>much </em><em>less </em>different than 1750 to 2015. The 1500 guy would learn some mind-bending shit about space and physics, he&#8217;d be impressed with how committed Europe turned out to be with that new imperialism fad, and he&#8217;d have to do some major revisions of his world map conception. But watching everyday life go by in 1750—transportation, communication, etc.—definitely wouldn&#8217;t make him die.</p><p>No, in order for the 1750 guy to have as much fun as we had with him, he&#8217;d have to go much farther back—maybe all the way back to about 12,000 BC, before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and to the concept of civilization. If someone from a purely hunter-gatherer world—from a time when humans were, more or less, just another animal species—saw the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being &#8220;inside,&#8221; and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery—he&#8217;d likely die.</p><p>And then what if, after dying, <em>he </em>got jealous and wanted to do the same thing. If he went back 12,000 years to 24,000 BC and got a guy and brought him to 12,000 BC, he&#8217;d show the guy everything and the guy would be like, &#8220;Okay what&#8217;s your point who cares.&#8221; For the 12,000 BC guy to have the same fun, he&#8217;d have to go back over 100,000 years and get someone he could show fire and language to for the first time.</p><p>In order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they&#8217;d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a &#8220;die level of progress,&#8221; or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened.</p><p>This pattern—human progress moving quicker and quicker as time goes on—is what futurist Ray Kurzweil calls human history&#8217;s Law of Accelerating Returns. This happens because more advanced societies have the ability to progress at a faster <em>rate</em> than less advanced societies—<em>because</em> they&#8217;re more advanced. 19th century humanity knew more and had better technology than 15th century humanity, so it&#8217;s no surprise that humanity made far more advances in the 19th century than in the 15th century—15th century humanity was no match for 19th century humanity.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3216\" id=\"note-1-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3216\" id=\"note2-1-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><sup>← open these</sup></span></p><p>This works on smaller scales too. The movie <em>Back to the Future</em> came out in 1985, and &#8220;the past&#8221; took place in 1955. In the movie, when Michael J. Fox went back to 1955, he was caught off-guard by the newness of TVs, the prices of soda, the lack of love for shrill electric guitar, and the variation in slang. It was a different world, yes—but if the movie were made today and the past took place in 1985, the movie could have had <em>much </em>more fun with <em>much </em>bigger differences. The character would be in a time before personal computers, internet, or cell phones—today&#8217;s Marty McFly, a teenager born in the late 90s, would be much more out of place in 1985 than the movie&#8217;s Marty McFly was in 1955.</p><p>This is for the same reason we just discussed—the Law of Accelerating Returns. The average rate of advancement between 1985 and 2015 was higher than the rate between 1955 and 1985—because the former was a more advanced world—so much more change happened in the most recent 30 years than in the prior 30.</p><p>So—advances are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more quickly. This suggests some pretty intense things about our future, right?</p><p>Kurzweil suggests that the progress of the entire 20th century would have been achieved in only 20 years at the rate of advancement in the year 2000—in other words, by 2000, the rate of progress was five times faster than the <em>average </em>rate of progress during the 20th century. He believes another 20th century&#8217;s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that <em>another </em>20th century&#8217;s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years. A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century&#8217;s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month. All in all, because of the Law of Accelerating Returns, Kurzweil believes that the 21st century will achieve <i>1,000 times </i>the progress of the 20th century.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3216\" id=\"note2-2-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>If Kurzweil and others who agree with him are correct, then we may be as blown away by 2030 as our 1750 guy was by 2015—i.e. the next DPU might only take a couple decades—and the world in 2050 might be <em>so </em>vastly different than today&#8217;s world that we would barely recognize it.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t science fiction. It&#8217;s what many scientists smarter and more knowledgeable than you or I firmly believe—and if you look at history, it&#8217;s what we should logically predict.</p><p>So then why, when you hear me say something like &#8220;the world 35 years from now might be totally unrecognizable,&#8221; are you thinking, &#8220;Cool&#8230;.but nahhhhhhh&#8221;? Three reasons we&#8217;re skeptical of outlandish forecasts of the future:</p><p><strong>1) When it comes to history, we think in straight lines. </strong>When we imagine the progress of the next 30 years, we look back to the progress of the previous 30 as an indicator of how much will likely happen. When we think about the extent to which the world will change in the 21st century, we just take the 20th century progress and add it to the year 2000. This was the same mistake our 1750 guy made when he got someone from 1500 and expected to blow his mind as much as his own was blown going the same distance ahead. It&#8217;s most intuitive for us to think <em>linearly,</em> when we should be thinking <em>exponentially</em>. If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the <em>current </em>rate of progress and judging based on that. They&#8217;d be more accurate, but still way off. In order to think about the future correctly, you need to imagine things moving at a <em>much faster rate </em>than they&#8217;re moving now.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3235\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png\" alt=\"Projections\" width=\"637\" height=\"392\" /></a></p><p><strong>2) The trajectory of very recent history often tells a distorted story. </strong>First, even a steep exponential curve seems linear when you only look at a tiny slice of it, the same way if you look at a little segment of a huge circle up close, it looks almost like a straight line. Second, exponential growth isn&#8217;t totally smooth and uniform. Kurzweil explains that progress happens in &#8220;S-curves&#8221;:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3241\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png\" alt=\"S-Curves\" width=\"479\" height=\"391\" /></a></p><p>An S is created by the wave of progress when a new paradigm sweeps the world. The curve goes through three phases:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">1. Slow growth (the early phase of exponential growth)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">2. Rapid growth (the late, explosive phase of exponential growth)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">3. A leveling off as the particular paradigm matures</span><a href=\"#footnote2-3-3216\" id=\"note2-3-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p>If you look only at very recent history, the part of the S-curve you&#8217;re on at the moment can obscure your perception of how fast things are advancing. The chunk of time between 1995 and 2007 saw the explosion of the internet, the introduction of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook into the public consciousness, the birth of social networking, and the introduction of cell phones and then smart phones. That was Phase 2: the growth spurt part of the S. But 2008 to 2015 has been less groundbreaking, at least on the technological front. Someone thinking about the future today might examine the last few years to gauge the current rate of advancement, but that&#8217;s missing the bigger picture. In fact, a new, huge Phase 2 growth spurt might be brewing right now.</p><p><b>3) O</b><strong>ur own experience makes us stubborn old men about the future. </strong>We base our ideas about the world on our personal experience, and that experience has ingrained the rate of growth of the recent past in our heads as &#8220;the way things happen.&#8221; We&#8217;re also limited by our imagination, which takes our experience and uses it to conjure future predictions—but often, what we know simply doesn&#8217;t give us the tools to think accurately about the future.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3216\" id=\"note-2-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> When we hear a prediction about the future that contradicts our experience-based notion of <em>how things work</em>, our instinct is that the prediction must be naive. If I tell you, later in this post, that you may live to be 150, or 250, or <em>not die at all</em>, your instinct will be, &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid—if there&#8217;s one thing I know from history, it&#8217;s that everybody dies.&#8221; And yes, no one in the past has not died. But no one flew airplanes before airplanes were invented either.</p><p>So while <em>nahhhhh </em>might feel right as you read this post, it&#8217;s probably actually wrong. The fact is, if we&#8217;re being truly logical and expecting historical patterns to continue, we should conclude that much, much, <em>much </em>more should change in the coming decades than we intuitively expect. Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they&#8217;ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human—kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth. And if you spend some time reading about what&#8217;s going on today in science and technology, you start to see a lot of signs quietly hinting that life as we currently know it cannot withstand the leap that&#8217;s coming next.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Road to Superintelligence</h2><h3><strong>What Is AI?</strong></h3><p>If you&#8217;re like me, you used to think Artificial Intelligence was a silly sci-fi concept, but lately you&#8217;ve been hearing it mentioned by serious people, and you don&#8217;t really quite get it.</p><p>There are three reasons a lot of people are confused about the term AI:</p><p><strong>1)</strong><strong>We associate AI with movies. </strong>Star Wars. Terminator. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even the Jetsons. And those are fiction, as are the robot characters. So it makes AI sound a little fictional to us.</p><p><strong>2) AI is a broad topic.</strong> It ranges from your phone&#8217;s calculator to self-driving cars to something in the future that might change the world dramatically. AI refers to all of these things, which is confusing.</p><p><strong>3) We use AI all the time in our daily lives, but we often don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s AI.</strong> John McCarthy, who coined the term &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; in 1956, complained that “as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3216\" id=\"note2-4-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> Because of this phenomenon, AI often sounds like a mythical future prediction more than a reality. At the same time, it makes it sound like a pop concept from the past that never came to fruition. Ray Kurzweil says he hears people say that AI withered in the 1980s, which he compares to &#8220;insisting that the Internet died in the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3216\" id=\"note2-5-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p>So let&#8217;s clear things up. First, stop thinking of <em>robots</em>. A robot is a <em>container </em>for AI, sometimes mimicking the human form, sometimes not—but the AI itself is the computer <em>inside </em>the robot. AI is the brain, and the robot is its body—if it even has a body. For example, the software and data behind Siri is AI, the woman&#8217;s voice we hear is a personification of that AI, and there&#8217;s no robot involved at all.</p><p>Secondly, you&#8217;ve probably heard the term &#8220;singularity&#8221; or &#8220;technological singularity.&#8221; This term has been used in math to describe an asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply. It&#8217;s been used in physics to describe a phenomenon like an infinitely small, dense black hole or the point we were all squished into right before the Big Bang. Again, situations where the usual rules don&#8217;t apply. In 1993, Vernor Vinge wrote a <a href=\"https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">famous essay</a> in which he applied the term to the moment in the future when our technology&#8217;s intelligence exceeds our own—a moment for him when life as we know it will be forever changed and normal rules will no longer apply. Ray Kurzweil then muddled things a bit by defining the singularity as the time when the Law of Accelerating Returns has reached such an extreme pace that technological progress is happening at a seemingly-infinite pace, and after which we&#8217;ll be living in a whole new world. I found that many of today&#8217;s AI thinkers have stopped using the term, and it&#8217;s confusing anyway, so I won&#8217;t use it much here (even though we&#8217;ll be focusing on that <em>idea</em> throughout).</p><p>Finally, while there are many different types or forms of AI since AI is a broad concept, the critical categories we need to think about are based on an AI&#8217;s <em>caliber</em>. There are three major AI caliber categories:</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 1) Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Weak AI</em>, Artificial Narrow Intelligence is AI that specializes in <em>one</em> area. There&#8217;s AI that can beat the world chess champion in chess, but that&#8217;s the only thing it does. Ask it to figure out a better way to store data on a hard drive, and it&#8217;ll look at you blankly.</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 2) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Strong AI</em>, or <em>Human-Level AI</em>, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a computer that is as smart as a human <em>across the board—</em>a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Creating AGI is a <em>much </em>harder task than creating ANI, and we&#8217;re yet to do it. Professor Linda Gottfredson describes intelligence as &#8220;a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.&#8221; AGI would be able to do all of those things as easily as you can.</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> Oxford philosopher and leading AI thinker Nick Bostrom <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> superintelligence as &#8220;an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.&#8221; Artificial Superintelligence ranges from a computer that&#8217;s just a little smarter than a human to one that&#8217;s trillions of times smarter—across the board. ASI is the reason the topic of AI is such a spicy meatball and why the words immortality and extinction will both appear in these posts multiple times.</p><p>As of now, humans have conquered the lowest caliber of AI—ANI—in many ways, and it&#8217;s everywhere. The AI Revolution is the road from ANI, through AGI, to ASI—a road we may or may not survive but that, either way, will change everything.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take a close look at what the leading thinkers in the field believe this road looks like and why this revolution might happen way sooner than you might think:</p><h3>Where We Are Currently—A World Running on ANI</h3><p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency at a <em>specific </em>thing. A few examples:</p><ul><li>Cars are full of ANI systems, from the computer that figures out when the anti-lock brakes should kick in to the computer that tunes the parameters of the fuel injection systems. Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLyNDhxwpqNe3UeEmGHl8g\" target=\"_blank\">self-driving car</a>, which is being tested now, will contain robust ANI systems that allow it to perceive and react to the world around it.</li><li>Your phone is a little ANI factory. When you navigate using your map app, receive tailored music recommendations from Pandora, check tomorrow&#8217;s weather, talk to Siri, or dozens of other everyday activities, you&#8217;re using ANI.</li><li>Your email spam filter is a classic type of ANI—it starts off loaded with intelligence about how to figure out what&#8217;s spam and what&#8217;s not, and then it learns and tailors its intelligence to you as it gets experience with your particular preferences. The Nest Thermostat does the same thing as it starts to figure out your typical routine and act accordingly.</li><li>You know the whole creepy thing that goes on when you search for a product on Amazon and then you see that as a &#8220;recommended for you&#8221; product on a <em>different </em>site, or when Facebook somehow knows who it makes sense for you to add as a friend? That&#8217;s a network of ANI systems, working together to inform each other about who you are and what you like and then using that information to decide what to show you. Same goes for Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;People who bought this also bought&#8230;&#8221; thing—that&#8217;s an ANI system whose job it is to gather info from the behavior of millions of customers and synthesize that info to cleverly upsell you so you&#8217;ll buy more things.</li><li>Google Translate is another classic ANI system—impressively good at one narrow task. Voice recognition is another, and there are a bunch of apps that use those two ANIs as a tag team, allowing you to speak a sentence in one language and have the phone spit out the same sentence in another.</li><li>When your plane lands, it&#8217;s not a human that decides which gate it should go to. Just like it&#8217;s not a human that determined the price of your ticket.</li><li>The world&#8217;s best Checkers, Chess, Scrabble, Backgammon, and Othello players are now all ANI systems.</li><li>Google search is one large ANI brain with incredibly sophisticated methods for ranking pages and figuring out what to show you in particular. Same goes for Facebook&#8217;s Newsfeed.</li><li>And those are just in the consumer world. Sophisticated ANI systems are widely used in sectors and industries like military, manufacturing, and finance (algorithmic high-frequency AI traders account for more than half of equity shares traded on US markets<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3216\" id=\"note2-6-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a>), and in expert systems like those that help doctors make diagnoses and, most famously, IBM&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/\" target=\"_blank\">Watson</a>, who contained enough facts and understood coy Trebek-speak well enough to soundly beat the most prolific <em>Jeopardy</em> champions.</li></ul><p>ANI systems as they are now aren&#8217;t especially scary. At worst, a glitchy or badly-programmed ANI can cause an isolated catastrophe like knocking out a power grid, causing a harmful nuclear power plant malfunction, or triggering a financial markets disaster (like the <a href=\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/flash-crash-dow-popup.png\" target=\"_blank\">2010 Flash Crash</a> when an ANI program reacted the wrong way to an unexpected situation and caused the stock market to briefly plummet, taking $1 trillion of market value with it, only part of which was recovered when the mistake was corrected).</p><p>But while ANI doesn&#8217;t have the capability to cause an <em>existential threat</em>, we should see this increasingly large and complex ecosystem of relatively-harmless ANI as a precursor of the world-altering hurricane that&#8217;s on the way. Each new ANI innovation quietly adds another brick onto the road to AGI and ASI. Or as Aaron Saenz <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/08/10/we-live-in-a-jungle-of-artificial-intelligence-that-will-spawn-sentience/\" target=\"_blank\">sees it</a>, our world&#8217;s ANI systems &#8220;are like the amino acids in the early Earth&#8217;s primordial ooze&#8221;—the inanimate stuff of life that, one unexpected day, woke up.</p><h3><strong>The Road From ANI to AGI</strong></h3><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">Why It&#8217;s So Hard</span></p><p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p><p>What&#8217;s interesting is that the hard parts of trying to build AGI (a computer as smart as humans in <em>general</em>, not just at one narrow specialty) are not intuitively what you&#8217;d think they are. Build a computer that can multiply two ten-digit numbers in a split second—incredibly easy. Build one that can look at a dog and answer whether it&#8217;s a dog or a cat—spectacularly difficult. Make AI that can beat any human in chess? Done. Make one that can read a paragraph from a six-year-old&#8217;s picture book and not just recognize the words but understand the <em>meaning</em> of them? Google is currently spending <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/01/google-buying-way-making-brain-irrelevant/\" target=\"_blank\">billions</a> of dollars trying to do it. Hard things—like calculus, financial market strategy, and language translation—are mind-numbingly easy for a computer, while easy things—like vision, motion, movement, and perception—are insanely hard for it. Or, as computer scientist Donald Knuth puts it, “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking.'&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3216\" id=\"note2-7-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p>What you quickly realize when you think about this is that those things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated, and they only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of million years of animal evolution. When you reach your hand up toward an object, the muscles, tendons, and bones in your shoulder, elbow, and wrist instantly perform a long series of physics operations, in conjunction with your eyes, to allow you to move your hand in a straight line through three dimensions. It seems effortless to you because you have perfected software in your brain for doing it. Same idea goes for why it&#8217;s not that malware is dumb for not being able to figure out the slanty word recognition test when you sign up for a new account on a site—it&#8217;s that your brain is super impressive for being <em>able </em>to.</p><p>On the other hand, multiplying big numbers or playing chess are new activities for biological creatures and we haven&#8217;t had any time to evolve a proficiency at them, so a computer doesn&#8217;t need to work too hard to beat us. Think about it—which would you rather do, build a program that could multiply big numbers or one that could understand the essence of a B well enough that you could show it a B in any one of thousands of unpredictable fonts or handwriting and it could instantly know it was a B?</p><p>One fun example—when you look at this, you and a computer both can figure out that it&#8217;s a rectangle with two distinct shades, alternating:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.21-AM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3228\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.21-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-21 at 12.59.21 AM\" width=\"195\" height=\"300\" /></a></p><p>Tied so far.

It would describe what it sees—a variety of two-dimensional shapes in several different shades—which is actually what&#8217;s there. Your brain is doing a ton of fancy shit to interpret the implied depth, shade-mixing, and room lighting the picture is trying to portray.<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3216\" id=\"note2-8-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a> And looking at the picture below, a computer sees a two-dimensional white, black, and gray collage, while you easily see what it really is—a photo of an entirely-black, 3-D rock:</p><div id=\"attachment_3226\" style=\"width: 567px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/article-2053686-0E8BC15900000578-845_634x330.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3226\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/article-2053686-0E8BC15900000578-845_634x330.jpg\" alt=\"article-2053686-0E8BC15900000578-845_634x330\" width=\"557\" height=\"290\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Matthew Lloyd</p></div><p>And everything we just mentioned is still only taking in stagnant information and processing it. To be human-level intelligent, a computer would have to understand things like the difference between subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased, relieved, content, satisfied, and glad, and why <em>Braveheart </em>was great but <em>The Patriot</em> was terrible.</p><p>Daunting.</p><p>So how do we get there?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">First Key to Creating AGI: Increasing Computational Power</span></p><p>One thing that definitely needs to happen for AGI to be a possibility is an increase in the power of computer hardware. If an AI system is going to be as intelligent as the brain, it&#8217;ll need to equal the brain&#8217;s raw computing capacity.</p><p>One way to express this capacity is in the total calculations per second (cps) the brain could manage, and you could come to this number by figuring out the maximum cps of each structure in the brain and then adding them all together.</p><p>Ray Kurzweil came up with a shortcut by taking someone&#8217;s professional estimate for the cps of one structure and that structure&#8217;s weight compared to that of the whole brain and then multiplying proportionally to get an estimate for the total. Sounds a little iffy, but he did this a bunch of times with various professional estimates of different regions, and the total always arrived in the same ballpark—around 10<sup>16</sup>, or 10 quadrillion cps.</p><p>Currently, the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputer, China&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-china-supercomputer-idUSKCN0J11VV20141117\" target=\"_blank\">Tianhe-2</a>, has actually beaten that number, clocking in at about 34 quadrillion cps. But Tianhe-2 is also a dick, taking up 720 square meters of space, using 24 megawatts of power (the brain runs on just <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/neuron-computer-chips-could-overcome-power-limitations-digital\" target=\"_blank\">20 watts</a>), and costing $390 million to build. Not especially applicable to wide usage, or even most commercial or industrial usage yet.</p><p>Kurzweil suggests that we think about the state of computers by looking at how many cps you can buy for $1,000. When that number reaches human-level—10 quadrillion cps—then that&#8217;ll mean AGI could become a very real part of life.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mooreslaw.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> is a historically-reliable rule that the world&#8217;s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially. Looking at how this relates to Kurzweil&#8217;s cps/$1,000 metric, we&#8217;re currently at about 10 trillion cps/$1,000, right on pace with this graph&#8217;s predicted trajectory:<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3216\" id=\"note2-9-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3229\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg\" alt=\"PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"512\" /></a></p><p>So the world&#8217;s $1,000 computers are now beating the mouse brain and they&#8217;re at about a thousandth of human level. This doesn&#8217;t sound like much until you remember that we were at about a trillionth of human level in 1985, a billionth in 1995, and a millionth in 2005. Being at a thousandth in 2015 puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain.</p><p>So on the hardware side, the raw power needed for AGI is technically available now, in China, and we&#8217;ll be ready for affordable, widespread AGI-caliber hardware within 10 years. But raw computational power alone doesn&#8217;t make a computer generally intelligent—the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">Second Key to Creating AGI: Making it Smart</span></p><p>This is the icky part. The truth is, no one really knows how to make it smart—we&#8217;re still debating how to make a computer human-level intelligent and capable of knowing what a dog and a weird-written B and a mediocre movie is. But there are a bunch of far-fetched strategies out there and at some point, one of them will work. Here are the three most common strategies I came across:</p><h4><strong>1) Plagiarize the brain. </strong></h4><p>This is like scientists toiling over how that kid who sits next to them in class is so smart and keeps doing so well on the tests, and even though they keep studying diligently, they can&#8217;t do nearly as well as that kid, and then they finally decide &#8220;k fuck it I&#8217;m just gonna copy that kid&#8217;s answers.&#8221; It makes sense—we&#8217;re stumped trying to build a super-complex computer, and there happens to be a perfect prototype for one in each of our heads.</p><p>The science world is working hard on reverse engineering the brain to figure out how evolution made such a rad thing—<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/08/reverse-engineering-brain-kurzweil/\" target=\"_blank\">optimistic estimates</a> say we can do this by 2030. Once we do that, we&#8217;ll know all the secrets of how the brain runs so powerfully and efficiently and we can draw inspiration from it and steal its innovations. One example of computer architecture that mimics the brain is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor &#8220;neurons,&#8221; connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing—like an infant brain. The way it &#8220;learns&#8221; is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it&#8217;s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it&#8217;s told it was wrong, those pathways&#8217; connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task. The brain learns a bit like this but in a more sophisticated way, and as we continue to study the brain, we&#8217;re discovering ingenious new ways to take advantage of neural circuitry.</p><p>More extreme plagiarism involves a strategy called &#8220;whole brain emulation,&#8221; where the goal is to slice a real brain into thin layers, scan each one, use software to assemble an accurate reconstructed 3-D model, and then implement the model on a powerful computer. We&#8217;d then have a computer officially capable of everything the brain is capable of—it would just need to learn and gather information. If engineers get <em>really </em>good, they&#8217;d be able to emulate a real brain with such exact accuracy that the brain&#8217;s full personality and memory would be intact once the brain architecture has been uploaded to a computer. If the brain belonged to Jim right before he passed away, the computer would now wake up as Jim (<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html\" target=\"_blank\">?</a>), which would be a robust human-level AGI, and we could now work on turning Jim into an unimaginably smart ASI, which he&#8217;d probably be really excited about.</p><p>How far are we from achieving whole brain emulation? Well so far, we&#8217;ve <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">not yet</span><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/weve-put-worms-mind-lego-robot-body-180953399/?no-ist\" target=\"_blank\">just recently</a> been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons. The human brain contains 100 billion. If that makes it seem like a hopeless project, remember the power of exponential progress—now that we&#8217;ve conquered the tiny worm brain, an ant might happen before too long, followed by a mouse, and suddenly this will seem much more plausible.</p><h4><strong>2) Try to make evolution do what it did before but for us this time.</strong></h4><p>So if we decide the smart kid&#8217;s test is too hard to copy, we can try to copy the way he <em>studies</em> for the tests instead.</p><p>Here&#8217;s something we know. Building a computer as powerful as the brain <em>is </em>possible—our own brain&#8217;s evolution is proof. And if the brain is just too complex for us to emulate, we could try to emulate <em>evolution </em>instead. The fact is, even if we can emulate a brain, that might be like trying to build an airplane by copying a bird&#8217;s wing-flapping motions—often, machines are best designed using a fresh, machine-oriented approach, not by mimicking biology exactly.</p><p>So how can we simulate evolution to build AGI? The method, called &#8220;genetic algorithms,&#8221; would work something like this: there would be a performance-and-evaluation process that would happen again and again (the same way biological creatures &#8220;perform&#8221; by living life and are &#8220;evaluated&#8221; by whether they manage to reproduce or not). A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be <em>bred </em>with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated. Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own.</p><p>The downside of copying evolution is that evolution likes to take a billion years to do things and we want to do this in a few decades.</p><p>But we have a lot of advantages over evolution. First, evolution has no foresight and works randomly—it produces more unhelpful mutations than helpful ones, but we would control the process so it would only be driven by beneficial glitches and targeted tweaks. Secondly, evolution doesn&#8217;t <em>aim </em>for anything, including intelligence—sometimes an environment might even select <em>against </em>higher intelligence (since it uses a lot of energy). We, on the other hand, could specifically direct this evolutionary process toward increasing intelligence. Third, to select for intelligence, evolution has to innovate in a bunch of other ways to facilitate intelligence—like revamping the ways cells produce energy—when we can remove those extra burdens and use things like electricity. It&#8217;s no doubt we&#8217;d be much, much faster than evolution—but it&#8217;s still not clear whether we&#8217;ll be able to improve upon evolution <em>enough</em> to make this a viable strategy.</p><h4 class=\"p1\"><b>3) Make this whole thing the computer&#8217;s problem, not ours.</b></h4><p class=\"p1\">This is when scientists get desperate and try to program the test to take itself. But it might be the most promising method we have.</p><p class=\"p1\">The idea is that we&#8217;d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself—allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own <em>architecture</em>. We&#8217;d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development. And that would be their main job—figuring out how to make <em>themselves</em> smarter. More on this later.</p><h4 class=\"p1\"><strong>All of This Could Happen Soon</strong></h4><p class=\"p1\">Rapid advancements in hardware and innovative experimentation with software are happening simultaneously, and AGI could creep up on us quickly and unexpectedly for two main reasons:</p><p class=\"p1\">1) Exponential growth is intense and what seems like a snail&#8217;s pace of advancement can quickly race upwards—this GIF illustrates this concept nicely:</p><div id=\"attachment_3225\" style=\"width: 639px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-3225 size-full\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"629\" height=\"354\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p></div><p class=\"p1\">2) When it comes to software, progress can seem slow, but then one epiphany can instantly change the rate of advancement (kind of like the way science, during the time humans thought the universe was geocentric, was having difficulty calculating how the universe worked, but then the discovery that it was heliocentric suddenly made everything <em>much </em>easier). Or, when it comes to something like a computer that improves itself, we might seem far away but actually be just one tweak of the system away from having it become 1,000 times more effective and zooming upward to human-level intelligence.</p><h3 class=\"p1\">The Road From AGI to ASI</h3><p class=\"p1\">At some point, we&#8217;ll have achieved AGI—computers with human-level general intelligence. Just a bunch of people and computers living together in equality.</p><p class=\"p1\">Oh actually not at all.</p><p class=\"p1\">The thing is, AGI with an identical level of intelligence and computational capacity as a human would still have significant advantages over humans. Like:</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span></p><ul><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Speed. </strong>The brain&#8217;s neurons max out at around 200 Hz, while today&#8217;s microprocessors (which are much slower than they will be when we reach AGI) run at 2 GHz, or 10 million times faster than our neurons. And the brain&#8217;s internal communications, which can move at about 120 m/s, are horribly outmatched by a computer&#8217;s ability to communicate optically at the speed of light.</li><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Size and storage. </strong>The brain is locked into its size by the shape of our skulls, and it couldn&#8217;t get much bigger anyway, or the 120 m/s internal communications would take too long to get from one brain structure to another. Computers can expand to any physical size, allowing far more hardware to be put to work, a much larger working memory (RAM), and a longterm memory (hard drive storage) that has both far greater capacity and precision than our own.</li><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Reliability and durability.</strong> It&#8217;s not only the memories of a computer that would be more precise. Computer transistors are more accurate than biological neurons, and they&#8217;re less likely to deteriorate (and can be repaired or replaced if they do). Human brains also get fatigued easily, while computers can run nonstop, at peak performance, 24/7.</li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Software:</strong></span></p><ul><li><strong>Editability, upgradability, and a wider breadth of possibility. </strong>Unlike the human brain, computer software can receive updates and fixes and can be easily experimented on. The upgrades could also span to areas where human brains are weak. Human vision software is superbly advanced, while its complex engineering capability is pretty low-grade. Computers could match the human on vision software but could <em>also </em>become equally optimized in engineering and any other area.</li><li><b>Collective capability. </b>Humans crush all other species at building a vast collective intelligence. Beginning with the development of language and the forming of large, dense communities, advancing through the inventions of writing and printing, and now intensified through tools like the internet, humanity&#8217;s collective intelligence is one of the major reasons we&#8217;ve been able to get so far ahead of all other species. And computers will be way better at it than we are. A worldwide network of AI running a particular program could regularly sync with itself so that anything any one computer learned would be instantly uploaded to all other computers. The group could also take on one goal as a unit, because there wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be dissenting opinions and motivations and self-interest, like we have within the human population.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3216\" id=\"note2-10-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a></li></ul><p class=\"p1\">AI, which will likely get to AGI by being programmed to self-improve, wouldn&#8217;t see &#8220;human-level intelligence&#8221; as some important milestone—it&#8217;s only a relevant marker from our point of view—and wouldn&#8217;t have any reason to &#8220;stop&#8221; at our level. And given the advantages over us that even human intelligence-equivalent AGI would have, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that it would only hit human intelligence for a brief instant before racing onwards to the realm of superior-to-human intelligence.</p><p class=\"p1\">This may shock the shit out of us when it happens. The reason is that from <em>our </em>perspective, A) while the intelligence of different kinds of animals varies, the main characteristic we&#8217;re aware of about any animal&#8217;s intelligence is that it&#8217;s far lower than ours, and B) we view the smartest humans as WAY smarter than the dumbest humans. Kind of like this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3250\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"Intelligence\" width=\"550\" height=\"432\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">So as AI zooms upward in intelligence toward us, we&#8217;ll see it as simply becoming smarter, <em>for an animal. </em>Then, when it hits the lowest capacity of humanity—Nick Bostrom uses the term &#8220;the village idiot&#8221;—we&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh wow, it&#8217;s like a dumb human. Cute!&#8221; The only thing is, in the grand spectrum of intelligence, <em>all </em>humans, from the village idiot to Einstein, are within a very small range—so <em>just </em>after hitting village idiot-level and being declared to be AGI, it&#8217;ll suddenly be smarter than Einstein and we won&#8217;t know what hit us:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3248\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png\" alt=\"Intelligence2\" width=\"550\" height=\"449\" /></a></p><p>And what happens…after that?</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 17pt;\">An Intelligence Explosion</span></p><p class=\"p1\">I hope you enjoyed normal time, because this is when this topic gets unnormal and scary, and it&#8217;s gonna stay that way from here forward. I want to pause here to remind you that every single thing I&#8217;m going to say is real—real science and real forecasts of the future from a large array of the most respected thinkers and scientists. Just keep remembering that.</p><p class=\"p1\">Anyway, as I said above, most of our current models for getting to AGI involve the AI getting there by self-improvement. And once it gets to AGI, even systems that formed and grew<i></i>through methods that didn&#8217;t involve self-improvement would now be smart enough to begin self-improving if they wanted to.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3216\" id=\"note-3-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p class=\"p1\">And here&#8217;s where we get to an intense concept: <strong>recursive self-improvement.</strong> It works like this—</p><p class=\"p1\">An AI system at a certain level—let&#8217;s say human village idiot—is programmed with the goal of improving its own intelligence. Once it does, it&#8217;s <em>smarter—</em>maybe at this point it&#8217;s at Einstein&#8217;s level—so now when it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and it can make bigger leaps. These leaps make it <em>much </em>smarter than any human, allowing it to make even <em>bigger</em> leaps. As the leaps grow larger and happen more rapidly, the AGI soars upwards in intelligence and soon reaches the superintelligent level of an ASI system. This is called an Intelligence Explosion,<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3216\" id=\"note2-11-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> and it&#8217;s the ultimate example of The Law of Accelerating Returns.</p><p class=\"p1\">There is some debate about how soon AI will reach human-level general intelligence—the median year on a survey of hundreds of scientists about when they believed we&#8217;d be more likely than not to have reached AGI was 2040<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3216\" id=\"note2-12-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a>—that&#8217;s only 25 years from now, which doesn&#8217;t sound that huge until you consider that many of the thinkers in this field think it&#8217;s likely that the progression from AGI to ASI happens <em>very </em>quickly. Like—this could happen:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>It takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general intelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world around it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting that milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to definitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI, 170,000 times more intelligent than a human.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ—we don&#8217;t have a word for an IQ of 12,952.</p><p class=\"p1\">What we do know is that humans&#8217; utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: <em>with intelligence comes power.</em> Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—<em>and this might happen</em><em> in the next few decades.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time—everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on Earth—all suddenly possible.

A long series with long posts and a long time between posts. It turns out that when it comes to Musk and his shit, there was a lot to say.</p><p>Anyone who’s read the first three posts in this series is aware that I’ve not only been buried in the things Musk is doing, I’ve been drinking a tall glass of the Elon Musk Kool-Aid throughout. I’m very, very into it.</p><p>I kind of feel like that’s fine, right? The dude is a steel-bending industrial giant in America in a time when there aren’t supposed to be steel-bending industrial giants in America, igniting revolutions in huge, old industries that aren’t supposed to be revolutionable. After emerging from the 1990s dotcom party with $180 million, instead of sitting back in his investor chair listening to pitches from groveling young entrepreneurs, he decided to start a brawl with a <em>group </em>of 900-pound sumo wrestlers—the auto industry, the oil industry, the aerospace industry, the military-industrial complex, the energy utilities—and he might actually be <em>winning</em>. And all of this, it really seems, for the purpose of giving our species a better future.</p><p>Pretty Kool-Aid worthy. But someone being exceptionally rad isn’t Kool-Aid worthy enough to warrant 90,000 words over a string of months on a blog that’s supposed to be about a wide range of topics.</p><p>During the first post, I laid out the two objectives for the series:</p><p><strong>1) To understand why Musk is doing what he’s doing.</strong></p><p><strong>2) To understand why Musk is <em>able to </em>do what he’s doing. </strong></p><p>So far, we’ve spent most of the time exploring objective #1. But what <em>really</em> intrigued me as I began thinking about this was objective #2. I’m fascinated by those rare people in history who manage to dramatically change the world during their short time here, and I’ve always liked to study those people and read their biographies. Those people know something the rest of us don’t, and we can learn something valuable from them. Getting access to Elon Musk gave me what I decided was an unusual chance to get my hands on one of those people and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/examining-elon-musk-up-close.html\" target=\"_blank\">examine them up close</a>. If it were just Musk’s money or intelligence or ambition or good intentions that made him so capable, there would be more Elon Musks out there. No, it’s something else—what TED curator Chris Anderson called Musk’s “secret sauce”—and for me, this series became a mission to figure it out.</p><p>The good news is, after a <em>lot </em>of time thinking about this, reading about this, and talking to him and his staff, I think I’ve got it. What for a while was a large pile of facts, observations, and sound bites eventually began to congeal into a common theme—a trait in Musk that I believe he shares with many of the most dynamic icons in history and that separates him from almost everybody else.</p><p>As I worked through the Tesla and SpaceX posts, this concept kept surfacing, and it became clear to me that this series couldn’t end without a deep dive into exactly what it is that Musk and a few others do so unusually well. The thing that tantalized me is that this secret sauce is actually accessible to everyone and right there in front of us—if we can just wrap our heads around it. Mulling this all over has legitimately affected the way I think about my life, my future, and the choices I make—and I’m going to try my best in this post to explain why.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Two Kinds of Geology</strong></span></p><p>In 1681, English theologian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Burnet\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Burnet</a> published <i>Sacred Theory of the Earth, </i>in which he explained how geology worked. What happened was, around 6,000 years ago, the Earth was formed as a perfect sphere with a surface of idyllic land and a watery interior. But then, when the surface dried up a little later, cracks formed in its surface, releasing much of the water from within. The result was the Biblical Deluge and Noah having to deal with a ton of shit all week. Once things settled down, the Earth was no longer a perfect sphere—all the commotion had distorted the surface, bringing about mountains and valleys and caves down below, and the whole thing was littered with the fossils of the flood’s victims.</p><p>And bingo. Burnet had figured it out. The great puzzle of fundamental theology had been to reconcile the large number of seemingly-very-old Earth features with the much shorter timeline of the Earth detailed in the Bible. For theologians of the time, it was their version of the general relativity vs. quantum mechanics quandary, and Burnet had come up with a viable string theory to unify it all under one roof.</p><p>It wasn’t just Burnet. There were enough theories kicking around reconciling geology with the verses of the Bible to today warrant a 15,000-word “Flood Geology” <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_geology\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p><p>Around the same time, another group of thinkers started working on the geology puzzle: scientists.</p><p>For the theologian puzzlers, the starting rules of the game were, “Fact: the Earth began 6,000 years ago and there was at one point an Earth-sweeping flood,” and their puzzling took place strictly within that context. But the scientists started the game with no rules at all. The puzzle was a blank slate where any observations and measurements they found were welcome.</p><p>Over the next 300 years, the scientists built theory upon theory, and as new technologies brought in new types of measurements, old theories were debunked and replaced with new updated versions. The science community kept surprising themselves as the apparent age of the Earth grew longer and longer. In 1907, there was a huge breakthrough when American scientist Bertram Boltwood pioneered the technique of deciphering the age of rocks through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating\" target=\"_blank\">radiometric dating</a>, which found elements in a rock with a known rate of radioactive decay and measured what portion of those elements remained intact and what portion had already converted to decay substance.</p><p>Radiometric dating blew Earth’s history backwards into the billions of years, which burst open new breakthroughs in science like the theory of Continental Drift, which in turn led to the theory of Plate Tectonics. The scientists were on a roll.</p><p>Meanwhile, the flood geologists would have none of it. To them, any conclusions from the science community were moot because they were breaking the rules of the game to begin with. The Earth was <em>officially</em> less than 6,000 years old, so if radiometric dating showed otherwise, it was a flawed technique, period.</p><p>But the scientific evidence grew increasingly compelling, and as time wore on, more and more flood geologists threw in the towel and accepted the scientist’s viewpoint—maybe they had had the rules of the game wrong.</p><p>Some, though, held strong. The rules were the rules, and it didn’t matter how many people agreed that the Earth was billions of years old—it was a grand conspiracy.</p><p>Today, there are <a href=\"https://www.probe.org/the-grand-canyon-and-the-age-of-the-earth/\" target=\"_blank\">still</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/usnews/060907a.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> flood geologists making their case. Just recently, an author named Tom Vail wrote a book called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Canyon-A-Different-View/dp/0890513732\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Canyon: A Different View</a></em>, in which he explains:</p><p><em>Contrary to what is widely believed, radioactive dating has not proven the rocks of the Grand Canyon to be millions of years old. The vast majority of the sedimentary layers in the Grand Canyon were deposited as the result of a global flood that occurred after and as a result of the initial sin that took place in the Garden of Eden.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>If the website analytics stats on <a href=\"https://chartbeat.com\" target=\"_blank\">Chartbeat</a> included a “Type of Geologist” demographic metric, I imagine that for Wait But Why readers, the breakdown would look something like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geology-Breakdown.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4415 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geology-Breakdown.jpg\" alt=\"Geology Breakdown\" width=\"401\" height=\"277\" /></a></p><p>It makes sense. Whether religious or not, most people who read this site are big on data, evidence, and accuracy. I’m reminded of this every time I make an error in a post.</p><p>Whatever role faith plays in the spiritual realm, what most of us agree on is that when seeking answers to our questions about the age of the Earth, the history of our species, the causes of lightning, or any other physical phenomenon in the universe, data and logic are far more effective tools than faith and scripture.</p><p>And yet—after thinking about this for a while, I’ve come to an unpleasant conclusion:</p><p><strong>When it comes to most of the way we think, the way we make decisions, and the way we live our lives, we’re much more like the flood geologists than the science geologists.</strong></p><p>And Elon’s secret? He’s a scientist through and through.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Hardware and Software</strong></span></p><p>The first clue to the way Musk thinks is in the super odd way that he talks. For example:</p><p><strong>Human child: </strong>“I’m scared of the dark, because that’s when all the scary shit is gonna get me and I won’t be able to see it coming.”</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>“When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it’s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn’t afraid of the dark anymore after that.”<a href=\"#footnote2-2-4367\" id=\"note2-2-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>Or:</p><p><strong>Human father: </strong>“I’d like to start working less because my kids are starting to grow up.”</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>“I’m trying to throttle back, because particularly the triplets are starting to gain consciousness. They’re almost two.”<a href=\"#footnote2-3-4367\" id=\"note2-3-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p>Or:</p><p><strong>Human single man: </strong>“I’d like to find a girlfriend. I don’t want to be so busy with work that I have no time for dating.”</p><p><b>Elon: </b>“I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to 10 — how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-4367\" id=\"note2-4-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p>I call this MuskSpeak. MuskSpeak is a language that describes everyday parts of life as exactly what they actually, literally are.</p><p>There are plenty of instances of technical situations when we all agree that MuskSpeak makes much more sense than normal human parlance—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heart-Surgery1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4441 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heart-Surgery1.jpg\" alt=\"Heart Surgery\" width=\"533\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><p>—but what makes Musk odd is that he thinks about <em>most </em>things in MuskSpeak, including many areas where you don’t usually find it. Like when I asked him if he was afraid of death, and he said having kids made him more comfortable with dying, because “kids sort of are a bit you. At least they’re half you. They’re half you at the hardware level, and depending on how much time you have with them, they’re that percentage of you at the software level.”</p><p>When you or I look at kids, we see small, dumb, cute people. When Musk looks at his five kids, he sees five of his favorite computers. When he looks at you, he sees a computer. And when he looks in the mirror, he sees a computer—<em>his </em>computer. It’s not that Musk suggests that people are <em>just </em>computers—it’s that he sees people as computers on top of whatever else they are.</p><p>And at the most literal level, Elon’s right about people being computers. At its simplest definition, a computer is an object that can store and process data—which the brain certainly is.</p><p>And while this isn’t the most poetic way to think about our minds, I’m starting to believe that it’s one of those areas of life where MuskSpeak can serve us well—because thinking of a brain as a computer forces us to consider the distinction between our hardware and our software, a distinction we often fail to recognize.</p><p>For a computer, hardware is defined as “the machines, wiring, and other physical components of a computer.” So for a human, that’s the physical brain they were born with and all of its capabilities, which determines their raw intelligence, their innate talents, and other natural strengths and shortcomings.</p><p>A computer’s software is defined as “the programs and other operating information used by a computer.” For a human, that’s what they know and how they think—their belief systems, thought patterns, and reasoning methods. Life is a flood of incoming data of all kinds that enter the brain through our senses, and it’s the software that assesses and filters all that input, processes and organizes it, and ultimately uses it to generate the key output—a decision.</p><p>The hardware is a ball of clay that’s handed to us when we’re born. And of course, not all clay is equal—each brain begins as a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses across a wide range of processes and capabilities.</p><p>But it’s the software that determines what kind of tool the clay gets shaped into.</p><p>When people think about what makes someone like Elon Musk so effective, they often focus on the hardware—and Musk’s hardware has some pretty impressive specs. But the more I learn about Musk and other people who seem to have superhuman powers—whether it be Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, Genghis Khan, Marie Curie, John Lennon, Ayn Rand,<a href=\"#footnote-2-4367\" id=\"note-2-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> or Louis C.K.—the more I’m convinced that it’s their software, not their natural-born intelligence or talents, that makes them so rare and so effective.</p><p>So let’s talk about software—starting with Musk’s. As I wrote the other three posts in this series, I looked at everything I was learning about Musk—the things he says, the decisions he makes, the missions he takes on and how he approaches them—as clues to how his underlying software works.</p><p>Eventually, the clues piled up and the shape of the software began to reveal itself. Here’s what I think it looks like:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Elon’s Software</strong></span></p><p>The structure of Musk’s software starts like many of ours, with what we’ll call the Want box:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Box.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4402 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Box.png\" alt=\"Software - Want Box\" width=\"252\" height=\"267\" /></a></p><p>This box contains anything in life where you want Situation A to turn into Situation B. Situation A is currently what’s happening and you want something to change so that Situation B is what’s happening instead. Some examples:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wants.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4442 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wants.jpg\" alt=\"Wants\" width=\"600\" height=\"317\" /></a></p><p>Next, the Want box has a partner in crime—what we’ll call the Reality box. It contains all things that are possible:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Box.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4399 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Box.png\" alt=\"Software - Reality Box\" width=\"303\" height=\"246\" /></a></p><p>Pretty straightforward.</p><p>The overlap of the Want and Reality boxes is the Goal Pool, where your goal options live:<a href=\"#footnote-3-4367\" id=\"note-3-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Goal-Pool1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4434 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Goal-Pool1.png\" alt=\"Software - Goal Pool\" width=\"443\" height=\"212\" /></a></p><p>So you pick a goal from the pool—the thing you’re going to try to move from Point A to Point B.</p><p>And how do you cause something to change? You direct your power towards it. A person’s power can come in various forms: your time, your energy (mental and physical), your resources, your persuasive ability, your connection to others, etc.</p><p>The concept of employment is just Person A using their resources power (a paycheck) to direct Person B’s time and/or energy power toward Person A’s goal. When Oprah publicly recommends a book, that’s combining her abundant power of connection (she has a huge reach) and her abundant power of persuasion (people trust her) and directing them towards the goal of getting the book into the hands of thousands of people who would have otherwise never known about it.</p><p>Once a goal has been selected, you know the <em>direction</em> in which to point your power. Now it’s time to figure out the most effective way to use that power to generate the outcome you want—that’s your strategy:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Box.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4437 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Box.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Strategy Box\" width=\"421\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><p>Simple right? And probably not that different from how you think.</p><p>But what makes Musk’s software so effective isn’t its structure, it’s that he uses it like a scientist. Carl Sagan said, “Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge,” and you can see Musk apply that way of thinking in two key ways:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) He builds each software component himself, from the ground up. </strong></span></p><p>Musk calls this “reasoning from first principles.” I’ll let him explain:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I think generally people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good.” But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-5-4367\" id=\"note2-5-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p class=\"p1\">In science, this means starting with what evidence shows us to be true. A scientist doesn’t say, “Well we know the Earth is flat because that’s the way it looks, that’s what’s intuitive, and that’s what everyone agrees is true,” a scientist says, “The part of the Earth that I can see at any given time appears to be flat, which would be the case when looking at a small piece of many differently shaped objects up close, so I don’t have enough information to know what the shape of the Earth is. One reasonable hypothesis is that the Earth is flat, but until we have tools and techniques that can be used to prove or disprove that hypothesis, it is an open question.”</p><p class=\"p1\">A scientist gathers together only what he or she knows to be true—the first principles—and uses those as the puzzle pieces with which to construct a conclusion.</p><p class=\"p1\">Reasoning from first principles is a hard thing to do in life, and Musk is a master at it. Brain software has four major decision-making centers:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>1) Filling in the Want box</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>2) Filling in the Reality box</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><b>3) Goal selection from the Goal Pool</b></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>4) Strategy formation</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Musk works through each of these boxes by reasoning from first principles. Filling in the Want box from first principles requires a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself. Filling in the Reality box requires the clearest possible picture of the actual facts of both the world and your own abilities. The Goal Pool should double as a Goal Selection Laboratory that contains tools for intelligently measuring and weighing options. And strategies should be formed based on what you know, not on what is typically done.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) He continually adjusts each component’s conclusions as new information comes in.</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">You might remember doing proofs in geometry class, one of the most mundane parts of everyone’s childhood. These ones:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given:</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given:</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore:</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">Math is satisfyingly exact. Its givens are exact and its conclusions are airtight.</p><p class=\"p1\">In math, we call givens “axioms,” and axioms are 100% true. So when we build conclusions out of axioms, we call them “proofs,” which are also 100% true.</p><p class=\"p1\">Science doesn’t have axioms or proofs, for good reason.</p><p class=\"p1\">We could have called Newton’s law of universal gravitation a proof—and for a long time, it certainly seemed like one—but then what happens when Einstein comes around and shows that Newton was actually “zoomed in,” like someone calling the Earth flat, and when you zoom <em>way </em>out, you discover that the <em>real </em>law is general relativity and Newton’s law actually stops working under extreme conditions, while general relativity works no matter what. So then, you’d call general relativity a proof instead. Except then what happens when quantum mechanics comes around and shows that general relativity fails to apply on a tiny scale and that a new set of laws is needed to account for those cases.</p><p class=\"p1\">There are no axioms or proofs in science because nothing is for sure and everything we feel sure about might be disproven. Richard Feynman has said, “Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty—some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.” Instead of proofs, science has <em>theories</em>. Theories are based on hard evidence and treated as truths, but at all times they’re susceptible to being adjusted or disproven as new data emerges.</p><p class=\"p1\">So in science, it’s more like:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (for now):</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given (for now):</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore (for now):</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">In our lives, the only true axiom is “I exist.” Beyond that, nothing is for sure. And for most things in life, we can’t even build a real scientific theory because life doesn’t tend to have exact measurements.</p><p class=\"p1\">Usually, the best we can do is a strong hunch based on what data we have. And in science, a hunch is called a hypothesis. Which works like this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (it seems, based on what I know):</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given (<strong>it seems, based on what I know</strong>):</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore (<strong>it seems, based on what I know</strong>):</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">Hypotheses are built to be tested. Testing a hypothesis can disprove it or strengthen it, and if it passes enough tests, it can be upgraded to a theory.</p><p class=\"p1\">So after Musk builds his conclusions from first principles, what does he do? He tests the shit out of them, continually, and adjusts them regularly based on what he learns. Let’s go through the whole process to show how:</p><p class=\"p1\">You begin by reasoning from first principles to A) fill in the Want box, B) fill in the Reality box, C) select a goal from the pool, and D) build a strategy—and then you get to work. You’ve used first principles thinking to decide where to point your power and the most effective way to use it.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the goal-achievement strategy you came up with was just your first crack. It was a hypothesis, ripe for testing. You test a strategy hypothesis one way: action. You pour your power into the strategy and see what happens. As you do this, data starts flowing in—results, feedback, and new information from the outside world. Certain parts of your strategy hypothesis might be strengthened by this new data, others might be weakened, and new ideas may have sprung to life in your head through the experience—but either way, some adjustment is usually called for:<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Loop.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4401 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Loop.png\" alt=\"Software - Strategy Loop\" width=\"345\" height=\"469\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">As this strategy loop spins and your power becomes more and more effective at accomplishing your goal, other things are happening down below.</p><p class=\"p1\">For someone reasoning from first principles, the Want box at any given time is a snapshot of their innermost desires the last time they thought hard about it. But the contents of the Want box are also a hypothesis, and experience can show you that you were wrong about something you thought you wanted or that you want something you didn’t realize you did. At the same time, the inner you isn’t a statue—it’s a shifting, morphing sculpture whose innermost values change as time passes. So even if something in the Want box was correct at one point, as <em>you</em> change, it may lose its place in the box. The Want box should serve the current inner you as best possible, which requires you to update it, something you do through reflection:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4438 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Want Loop\" width=\"453\" height=\"505\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">A rotating Want loop is called evolution.</p><p class=\"p1\">On the other side of the aisle, the Reality box is also going through a process. “Things that are possible” is a hypothesis, maybe more so than anything else. It takes into account both the state of the world and your own abilities. And as your own abilities change and grow, the world changes even faster. What was possible in the world in 2005 is <em>very</em> different from what’s possible today, and it’s a huge (and rare) advantage to be working with an up-to-date Reality box.</p><p class=\"p1\">Filling in your Reality box from first principles is a great challenge, and keeping the box current so that it matches actual reality takes continual work.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Loop.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4428 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Loop.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Reality Loop\" width=\"482\" height=\"482\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">For each of these areas, the box represents the current hypothesis and the circle represents the source of new information that can be used to adjust the hypothesis. It’s our duty to remember that the circles are the boss, not the boxes—the boxes are only trying their best to do the circles proud. And if we fall out of touch with what’s happening in the circles, the info in the boxes becomes obsolete and a less effective source for our decision-making.</p><p class=\"p1\">Thinking about the software as a whole, let’s take a step back. What we see is a goal formation mechanism below and a goal attainment mechanism above. One thing goal attainment often requires is laser focus. To get the results we want, we zoom in on the micro picture, sinking our teeth into our goal and honing in on it with our strategy loop.</p><p class=\"p1\">But as time passes, the Want box and Reality box adjust contents and morph shape, and eventually, something else can happen—the Goal Pool changes.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Goal Pool is just the overlap of the Want and Reality boxes, so its own shape and contents are totally dependent on the state of those boxes. And as you live your life inside the goal attainment mechanism above, it’s important to make sure that what you’re working so hard on remains in line with the Goal Pool below—so let’s add in two big red arrows for that:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Full.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4427 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Full.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Full\" width=\"567\" height=\"498\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Checking in with the large circle down below requires us to lift our heads up from the micro mission and do some macro reflection. And when enough changes happen in the Want and Reality boxes that the goal you’re pursuing is no longer in the goal pool, it calls for a macro life change—a breakup, a job switch, a relocation, a priority swap, an attitude shift.</p><p class=\"p1\">All together, the software I’ve described is a living, breathing system, constructed on a rock solid foundation of first principles, and built to be nimble, to keep itself honest, and to change shape as needed to best serve its owner.</p><p class=\"p1\">And if you read about Elon Musk’s life, you can watch this software in action.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How Musk’s software wrote his life story</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Getting started</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Step 1 for Elon was filling in the contents of the Want box. Doing this from first principles is a huge challenge—you have to dig deep into concepts like right and wrong, good and bad, important and trivial, valuable and frivolous. You have to figure out what you respect, what you disdain, what fascinates you, what bores you, and what excites you deep in your inner child. Of course, there’s no way for anyone of any age to have a clear cut answer to these questions, but Elon did the best thing he could by ignoring others and independently pondering.</p><p class=\"p1\">I talked with him about his early thought process in figuring out what to do with his career. He has said many times that he cares deeply about the future well-being of the human species—something that is clearly in the center of his Want box. I asked how he came to that, and he explained:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The thing that I care about is—when I look into the future, I see the future as a series of branching probability streams. So you have to ask, what are we doing to move down the good stream—the one that’s likely to make for a good future? Because otherwise, you look ahead, and it’s like “Oh it’s dark.” If you’re projecting to the future, and you’re saying “Wow, we’re gonna end up in some terrible situation,” that’s depressing.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Fair. Honing in on his specific path, I brought up the great modern physicists like Einstein and Hawking and Feynman, and I asked him whether he considered going into scientific discovery instead of engineering. His response:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I certainly admire the discoveries of the great scientists. They’re discovering what already exists—it’s a deeper understanding of how the universe already works. That’s cool—but the universe already sort of knows that. What matters is knowledge in a human context. What I’m trying to ensure is that knowledge in a human context is still possible in the future. So it’s sort of like—I’m more like the gardener, and then there are the flowers. If there’s no garden, there’s no flowers. I could try to be a flower in the garden, or I could try to make sure there is a garden. So I’m trying to make sure there is a garden, such that in the future, many Feynmans may bloom.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, both A and B are good, but without A there is no B. So I choose A.</p><p class=\"p1\">He went on:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I was at one point thinking about doing physics as a career—I did undergrad in physics—but in order to really advance physics these days, you need the data. Physics is fundamentally governed by the progress of engineering. This debate—“Which is better, engineers or scientists? Aren’t scientists better? Wasn’t Einstein the smartest person?”—personally, I think that engineering is better because in the absence of the engineering, you do not have the data. You just hit a limit. And yeah, you can be real smart within the context of the limit of the data you have, but unless you have a way to get more data, you can’t make progress. Like look at Galileo. He engineered the telescope—that’s what allowed him to see that Jupiter had moons. The limiting factor, if you will, is the engineering. And if you want to advance civilization, you must address the limiting factor. Therefore, you must address the engineering.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">A and B are both good, but B can only advance if A advances. So I choose A.</p><p class=\"p1\">In thinking about where exactly to point himself to best help humanity, Musk says that in college, he thought hard about the first principles question, “What will most affect the future of humanity?” and put together a list of five things: “the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.”<a href=\"#footnote2-6-4367\" id=\"note2-6-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><p class=\"p1\">Hearing him talk about what matters to him, you can see up and down the whole stack of Want box reasoning that led him to his current endeavors.</p><p class=\"p1\">He has other reasons too. Next to wanting to help humanity in the Want box is this quote:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I’m interested in things that change the world or affect future in wondrous new technology where you see it and you’re like, “How did that even happen? How is that possible?”</em><a href=\"#footnote2-7-4367\" id=\"note2-7-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p class=\"p1\">This follows a theme of Musk being passionate about super-advanced technology and the excitement it brings to him and other people. So given all of the above, an ideal endeavor for Musk would be something involving engineering, something in an area that will be important for the future, and something to do with cutting-edge technology. Those broad, basic Want box items alone narrow down the goal pool considerably.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, he was a teenager with no money, reputation, or connections, and limited knowledge and skills. In other words, his Reality box wasn’t that big. So he did what many young people do—he focused his early goals not around achieving his Wants, but expanding the Reality box and its list of “things that are possible.” He wanted to be able to legally stay in the US after college, and he also wanted to gain more knowledge about engineering, so he killed two birds with one stone and applied to a PhD program at Stanford to study high energy density capacitors, a technology aimed at coming up with a more efficient way than traditional batteries to store energy.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>U-turn to the internet</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Musk had gone into the Goal Pool and picked the Stanford program, and he moved to California to get started. But there was one thing—it was 1995. The internet was in the early stages of taking off and moving much faster than people had anticipated. It was also a world Musk could dive into without money or a reputation. So he added a bunch of internet-related possibilities into his Reality box. The early internet was also more <em>exciting </em>than he had anticipated—so getting involved in it quickly found its way into his Want box.</p><p class=\"p1\">These rapid adjustments caused big changes in his Goal Pool, to the point where the Stanford PhD was no longer what his software’s goal formation center was outputting.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most people would have stuck with the Stanford program—because they had already told everyone about it and it would be weird to quit, because it was Stanford, because it was a more normal path, because it was safer, because the internet might be a fad, because what if he were 35 one day and was a failure with no money because he couldn’t get a good job without the right degree.</p><p class=\"p1\">Musk quit the program after two days. The big macro arrow of his software came down on the right, saw that what he was embarking on wasn’t in the Goal Pool anymore, and he trusted his software—so he made a macro change.</p><p class=\"p1\">He started Zip2 with his brother, an early cross between the concepts of the Yellow Pages and Google Maps. Four years later, they sold the company and Elon walked away with $22 million.</p><p class=\"p1\">As a dotcom millionaire, the conventional wisdom was to settle down as a lifelong rich guy and either invest in other companies or start something new with other people’s money. But Musk’s goal formation center had other ideas. His Want box was bursting with ambitious startup ideas that he thought could have major impact on the world, and his Reality box, which now included $22 million, told him that he had a high chance of succeeding. Being leisurely on the sidelines was nowhere in his Want box and totally unnecessary according to his Reality box.</p><p class=\"p1\">So he used his newfound wealth to start X.com in 1999, with the vision to build a full-service online financial institution. The internet was still young and the concept of storing your money in an online bank was totally inconceivable to most people, and Musk was advised by many that it was a crazy plan. But again, Musk trusted his software. What he knew about the internet told him that this was inside the Reality box—because his reasoning told him that when it came to the internet, the Reality box had grown <em>much </em>bigger than people appreciated—and that was all he needed to know to move forward. In the top part of his software, as his strategy-action-results-adjustments loop spun, X.com’s service changed, the team changed, the mission changed, even the name changed. By the time eBay bought it in 2002, the company was called PayPal and it was a money transfer service. Musk made $180 million.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Following his software to space</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Now 31 years old and fabulously wealthy, Musk had to figure out what to do next with his life. On top of the “whatever you do, definitely don’t risk losing that money you have” conventional wisdom, there was also the common logic that said, “You’re awesome at building internet companies, but that’s all you know since you’ve never done anything else. You’re in your thirties now and it’s too late to do something big in a whole different field. This is the path you chose—you’re an internet guy.”</p><p class=\"p1\">But Musk went back to first principles. He looked inwards to his Want box, and having reflected on things, doing another internet thing wasn’t really in the box anymore. What was in there was his still-burning desire to help the future of humanity. In particular, he felt that to have a long future, the species would have to become much better at space travel.</p><p class=\"p1\">So he started exploring the limits of the Reality box when it came to getting involved in the aerospace industry.</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom screamed at the top of its lungs for him to stop. It said he had no formal education in the field and didn’t know the first thing about being a rocket scientist. But his software told him that formal education was just another way to download information into your brain and “a painfully slow download” at that—so he started reading, meeting people, and asking questions.</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom said no entrepreneur had ever succeeded at an endeavor like this before, and that he shouldn’t risk his money on something so likely to fail. But Musk’s stated philosophy is, “When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom said that he couldn’t afford to build rockets because they were too expensive and pointed to the fact that no one had ever made a rocket that cheaply before—but like the scientists who ignored those who said the Earth was 6,000 years old and those who insisted the Earth was flat, Musk started crunching numbers to do the math himself. Here’s how he recounts his thoughts:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Historically, all rockets have been expensive, so therefore, in the future, all rockets will be expensive. But actually that’s not true. If you say, what is a rocket made of? It’s made of aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber. And you can break it down and say, what is the raw material cost of all these components? And if you have them stacked on the floor and could wave a magic wand so that the cost of rearranging the atoms was zero, then what would the cost of the rocket be? And I was like, wow, okay, it’s really small—it’s like 2% of what a rocket costs. So clearly it would be in how the atoms are arranged—so you’ve got to figure out how can we get the atoms in the right shape much more efficiently. And so I had a series of meetings on Saturdays with people, some of whom were still working at the big aerospace companies, just to try to figure out if there’s some catch here that I’m not appreciating. And I couldn’t figure it out. There doesn’t seem to be any catch. So I started SpaceX.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-8-4367\" id=\"note2-8-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p class=\"p1\">History, conventional wisdom, and his friends all said one thing, but his own software, reasoning upwards from first principles, said another—and he trusted his software. He started <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a>, again with his own money, and dove in head first. The mission: dramatically lower the cost of space travel to make it possible for humanity to become multi-planetary.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Tesla and beyond</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Two years later, while running a growing SpaceX, a friend brought Elon to a company called AC Propulsion, which had created a prototype for a super-fast, long-range electric car. It blew him away. The Reality box of Musk’s software had told him that such a thing wasn’t yet possible, but it turns out that Musk wasn’t aware of how far lithium-ion batteries had advanced, and what he saw at AC Propulsion was new information about the world that put “starting a top-notch electric car company” into the Reality box in his head.</p><p class=\"p1\">He ran into the same conventional wisdom about battery costs as he had about rocket costs. Batteries had never been made cheaply enough to allow for a mass-market, long-range electric car because the cost of making a battery was simply too high. He used the same first principles logic and a calculator to determine that most of the problem was the cost of middlemen, not raw materials, and decided that actually, conventional wisdom was wrong and batteries could be much cheaper in the future. So he co-founded <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> with the mission of accelerating the advent of a mostly-electric-vehicle world—first by pouring in resources power and funding the company, and later by contributing his time and energy resources as well and becoming CEO.</p><p class=\"p1\">Two years after that, Musk co-founded <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html\" target=\"_blank\">SolarCity</a> with his cousins, a company whose goal was to revolutionize energy production by creating a large, distributed utility that would install solar panel systems on millions of homes. Musk knew that his time/energy power, the one kind of power that has hard limits, no matter who you are, was mostly used up, but he still had plenty of resources power—so he put it to work on another goal in his Goal Pool.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most recently, Musk has jumpstarted change in another area that’s important to him—the way people transport themselves from city to city. His idea is that there should be an entirely new mode of transport that will whiz people hundreds of miles by zinging them through a tube. He calls it the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop</a>. For this project, he’s not using his time, energy, or resources. Instead, by laying out his initial thoughts in a <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> and hosting a <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop\" target=\"_blank\">competition</a> for engineers to test out their innovations, he’s leveraging his powers of connection and persuasion to create change.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\">There are all kinds of tech companies that build software. They think hard, for years, about the best, most efficient way to make their product. Musk sees people as computers, and he sees his brain software as the most important product he owns—and since there aren’t companies out there designing brain software, he designed his own, beta tests it every day, and makes constant updates. That’s why he’s so outrageously effective, why he can disrupt <em>multiple </em>huge industries at once, why he can learn so quickly, strategize so cleverly, and visualize the future so clearly.</p><p class=\"p1\">This part of what Musk does isn’t rocket science—it’s common sense. Your entire life runs on the software in your head—why <em>wouldn’t </em>you obsess over optimizing it?</p><p class=\"p1\">And yet, not only do most of us not obsess over our own software—most of us don’t even <em>understand</em> our own software, how it works, or why it works that way. Let’s try to figure out why.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Most People’s Software</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">You always hear facts about human development and how so much of who you become is determined by your experiences during your formative years. A newborn’s brain is a malleable ball of hardware clay, and its job upon being born is to quickly learn about whatever environment it’s been born into and start shaping itself into the optimal tool for survival in those circumstances. That’s why it’s so easy for young children to learn new skills.</p><p class=\"p1\">As people age, the clay begins to harden and it becomes more difficult to change the way the brain operates. My grandmother has been using a computer as long as I have, but I use mine comfortably and easily because my malleable childhood brain easily wrapped itself around basic computer skills, while she has the same face on when she uses her computer that my tortoise does when I put him on top of a glass table and he thinks he’s inexplicably hovering two feet above the ground. She’ll use a computer when she needs to, but it’s not her friend.</p><p class=\"p1\">So when it comes to our brain software—our values, perceptions, belief systems, reasoning techniques—what are we learning during those key early years?</p><p class=\"p1\">Everyone’s raised differently, but for most people I know, it went something like this:</p><p class=\"p1\">We were taught all kinds of things by our parents and teachers—what’s right and wrong, what’s safe and dangerous, the kind of person you should and shouldn’t be. But the idea was: I’m an adult so I know much more about this than you, it’s not up for debate, don’t argue, just obey. That’s when the cliché “Why?” game comes in (what ElonSpeak calls “the chained why”).</p><p class=\"p1\">A child’s instinct isn’t just to know what to do and not to do, she wants to <em>understand </em>the rules of her environment. And to understand something, you have to have a sense of how that thing was built. When parents and teachers tell a kid to do XYZ and to simply obey, it’s like installing a piece of already-designed software in the kid’s head. When kids ask Why? and then Why? and then Why?, they’re trying to deconstruct that software to see how it was built—to get down to the first principles underneath so they can weigh how much they should actually care about what the adults seem so insistent upon.</p><p class=\"p1\">The first few times a kid plays the Why game, parents think it’s cute. But many parents, and most teachers, soon come up with a way to cut the game off:</p><p class=\"p1\">Because I said so.</p><p class=\"p1\">“Because I said so” inserts a concrete floor into the child’s deconstruction effort below which no further Why’s may pass. It says, “You want first principles? There. There’s your floor. No more Why’s necessary. Now fucking put your boots on because I said so and let’s go.”</p><p class=\"p1\">Imagine how this would play out in the science world.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4417 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-1.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 1\" width=\"350\" height=\"321\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4418 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-2.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 2\" width=\"449\" height=\"338\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-3.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4457 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-3.png\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 3\" width=\"449\" height=\"347\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-3.jpg\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-51.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4439 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-51.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 5\" width=\"451\" height=\"347\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-6.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4422 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-6.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 6\" width=\"450\" height=\"345\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-8.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4424 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-8.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 8\" width=\"452\" height=\"346\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-9.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4425 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-9.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 9\" width=\"450\" height=\"345\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-10.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4426 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Higgs-Hawking-10.jpg\" alt=\"Higgs Hawking 10\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">In fairness, parents’ lives suck. They have to do all the shit they used to have to do, except now on top of that there are these self-obsessed, drippy little creatures they have to upkeep, who think parents exist to serve them. On a busy day, in a bad mood, with 80 things to do, the Why game is a nightmare.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it might be a nightmare worth enduring. A command or a lesson or a word of wisdom that comes without any insight into the steps of logic it was built upon is feeding a kid a fish instead of teaching them to reason. And when that’s the way we’re brought up, we end up with a bucket of fish and no rod—a piece of installed software that we’ve learned how to use, but no ability to code anything ourselves.</p><p class=\"p1\">School makes things worse. One of my favorite thinkers, writer Seth Godin (whose <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> is bursting with first principles reasoning wisdom), explains in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXpbONjV1Jc\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a> about school that the current education system is a product of the Industrial Age, a time that catapulted productivity and the standard of living. But along with many more factories came the need for many more factory workers, so our education system was redesigned around that goal. He explains:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The deal was: universal public education whose sole intent was not to train the scholars of tomorrow—we had plenty of scholars. It was to train people to be willing to work in the factory. It was to train people to behave, to comply, to fit in. “We process you for a whole year. If you are defective, we hold you back and process you again. We sit you in straight rows, just like they organize things in the factory. We build a system all about interchangeable people because factories are based on interchangeable parts.”</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Couple that concept with what another favorite writer of mine, James Clear, explained recently on his <a href=\"http://jamesclear.com/creative-thinking\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>In the 1960s, a creative performance researcher named George Land conducted a study of 1,600 five-year-olds and 98 percent of the children scored in the “highly creative” range. Dr. Land re-tested each subject during five year increments. When the same children were 10-years-old, only 30 percent scored in the highly creative range. This number dropped to 12 percent by age 15 and just 2 percent by age 25. As the children grew into adults they effectively had the creativity trained out of them. In the words of Dr. Land, “non-creative behavior is learned.”</em></p><p class=\"p1\">It makes sense, right? Creative thinking is a close cousin of first principles reasoning. In both cases, the thinker needs to <em>invent</em> his own thought pathways. People think of creativity as a natural born talent, but it’s actually much more of a <em>way of thinking</em>—it’s the thinking version of painting onto a blank canvas. But to do that requires brain software that’s skilled and practiced at coming up with new things, and school trains us on the exact opposite concept—to follow the leader, single-file, and to get really good at taking tests. Instead of a blank canvas, school hands kids a coloring book and tells them to stay within the lines.<a href=\"#footnote-4-4367\" id=\"note-4-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p class=\"p1\">What this all amounts to is that during our brain’s most malleable years, parents, teachers, and society end up putting our clay in a mold and squeezing it tightly into a preset shape.</p><p class=\"p1\">And when we grow up, without having learned how to build our own style of reasoning and having gone through the early soul-searching that independent thinking requires, we end up needing to rely on whatever software was installed in us for everything—software that, coming from parents and teachers, was probably itself designed 30 years ago.</p><p class=\"p1\">30 years, if we’re lucky. Let’s think about this for a second.</p><p class=\"p1\">Just say you have an overbearing mother who insists you grow up with her values, her worldview, her fears, and her ambitions—because she knows best, because it’s a scary world out there, because XYZ is respectable, because she said so.</p><p class=\"p1\">Your head might end up running your whole life on “because mom says so” software. If you play the Why? game with something like the reason you’re in your current job, it may take a few Why’s to get there, but you’ll most likely end up hitting a concrete floor that says some version of “because mom says so.”</p><p class=\"p1\">But why does mom say so?</p><p class=\"p1\">Mom says so because <em>her</em> mom said so—after growing up in Poland in 1932, where she was from a home where <em>her</em> dad said so because <em>his </em>dad—a minister from a small town outside Krakow—said so after his grandfather, who saw some terrible shit go down during the Siberian Uprising of 1866, ingrained in his children’s heads the critical life lesson to never associate with blacksmiths.</p><p class=\"p1\">Through a long game of telephone, your mother now looks down upon office jobs and you find yourself feeling strongly about the only truly respectable career being in publishing. And you can list off a bunch of reasons why you feel that way—but if someone <em>really </em>grilled you on your reasons and on the reasoning beneath them, you end up in a confusing place. It gets confusing way down there because the first principles foundation at the bottom is a mishmash of the values and beliefs of a bunch of people from different generations and countries—a bunch of people who aren’t you.</p><p class=\"p1\">A common example of this in today’s world is that many people I know were raised by people who were raised by people who went through the Great Depression. If you solicit career advice from someone born in the US in the 1920s, there’s a good chance you’ll get an answer pumped out by this software:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grandma-Software.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4460 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grandma-Software.jpg\" alt=\"Grandma Software\" width=\"359\" height=\"584\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The person has lived a long life and has made it all the way to 2015, but their software was coded during the Great Depression, and if they’re not the type to regularly self-reflect and evolve, they still do their thinking with software from 1930. And if they installed that same software in their children’s heads and their children then passed it on to their own children, a member of Generation Y today might feel too scared to pursue an entrepreneurial or artistic endeavor and be totally unaware that they’re actually being haunted by the ghost of the Great Depression.</p><p class=\"p1\">When old software is installed on new computers, people end up with a set of values not necessarily based on their own deep thinking, a set of beliefs about the world not necessarily based on the reality of the world they live in, and a bunch of opinions they might have a hard time defending with an honest heart.</p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, a whole lot of convictions not really based on actual data. We have a word for that.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dogma</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding, they learn by some other way—by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!</em> —Richard Feynman</p><p class=\"p1\">Dogma is everywhere and comes in a thousand different varieties—but the format is generally the same:</p><p class=\"p1\">X is true because [authority] says so. The authority can be many things.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Because-I-said-so-21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4519\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Because-I-said-so-21.jpg\" alt=\"Because I said so 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"1867\" /></a></p><p>Dogma, unlike first principles reasoning, isn’t customized to the believer or her environment and isn’t meant to be critiqued and adjusted as things change. It’s not software to be coded—it’s a printed rulebook. Its rules may be originally based on reasoning by a certain kind of thinker in a certain set of circumstances, at a time far in the past or a place far away, or it may be based on no reasoning at all. But that doesn’t matter because you’re not supposed to dig too deep under the surface anyway—you’re just supposed to accept it, embrace it, and live by it. No evidence needed.</p><p class=\"p1\">You may not like living by someone else’s dogma, but you’re left without much choice. When your childhood attempts at understanding are met with “Because I said so,” and you absorb the implicit message “Your own reasoning capability is shit, don’t even try, just follow these rules so you don’t fuck your life up,” you grow up with little confidence in your own reasoning process. When you’re never forced to build your own reasoning pathways, you’re able to skip the hard process of digging deep to discover your own values and the sometimes painful experience of testing those values in the real world and learning you want to adjust them—and so you grow up a total reasoning amateur.</p><p class=\"p1\">Only strong reasoning skills can carve a unique life path, and without them, dogma will quickly have you living someone else’s life. Dogma doesn’t know you or care about you and is often completely wrong for you—it’ll have a would-be happy painter spending their life as a lawyer and a would-be happy lawyer spending their life as a painter.</p><p class=\"p1\">But when you don’t know how to reason, you don’t know how to evolve or adapt. If the dogma you grew up with isn’t working for you, you can reject it, but as a reasoning amateur, going it alone usually ends with you finding another dogma lifeboat to jump onto—another rulebook to follow and another authority to obey. You don’t know how to code your own software, so you install someone else’s.</p><p class=\"p1\">People don’t do any of this intentionally—usually if we reject a type of dogma, our intention is to break free of a life of dogmatic thinking altogether and brave the cold winds of independent reasoning. But dogmatic thinking is a hard habit to break, especially when it’s all you know. I have a friend who just had a baby, and she told me that she was so much more open-minded than her parents, because they wanted her to have a prestigious career, but she’d be open to her daughter doing anything. After a minute, she thought about it, and said, “Well actually, no, what I mean by that is if she wanted to go do something like spend her life on a farm in Montana, I’d be fine with that and my parents never would have been—but if she said she wanted to go work at a hedge fund, I’d kill her.” She realized mid-sentence that she wasn’t free of the rigid dogmatic thinking of her parents, she had just changed dogma brands.</p><p>This is the dogma trap, and it’s hard to escape from. Especially since dogma has a powerful ally—the group.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong> Tribes</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I’m very suspicious. It doesn’t make sense to me that you’d have the same solution to every issue.</em> —Louis C.K.</p><p class=\"p1\">What most dogmatic thinking tends to boil down to is another good Seth Godin <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/07/people-like-us-do-stuff-like-this.html\" target=\"_blank\">phrase</a>:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>People like us do stuff like this.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">It’s the rallying cry of tribalism.</p><p class=\"p1\">There’s an important distinction to make here. Tribalism tends to have a negative connotation, but the concept of a tribe itself isn’t bad. A tribe is just a group of people linked together by something they have in common—a religion, an ethnicity, a nationality, family, a philosophy, a cause. Christianity is a tribe. The US Democratic Party is a tribe. Australians are a tribe. Radiohead fans are a tribe. Arsenal fans are a tribe. The musical theater scene in New York is a tribe. Temple University is a tribe. And within large, loose tribes, there are smaller, tighter, sub-tribes. Your extended family is a tribe, of which your immediate family is a sub-tribe. Americans are a tribe, of which Texans are a sub-tribe, of which Evangelical Christians in Amarillo, Texas is a sub-sub-tribe.</p><p class=\"p1\">What makes tribalism a good or bad thing depends on the tribe member and their relationship with the tribe. In particular, one simple distinction:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tribalism is good when the tribe and the tribe member both have an independent identity and they <em>happen </em>to be the same. </strong>The tribe member has chosen to be a part of the tribe because it happens to match who he really is. If either the identity of the tribe or the member evolves to the point where the two no longer match, the person will leave the tribe. Let’s call this <strong>conscious tribalism.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tribalism is bad when the tribe and tribe member’s identity are one and the same. </strong>The tribe member’s identity is determined by whatever the tribe’s dogma happens to say. If the identity of the tribe changes, the identity of the tribe member changes with it in lockstep. The tribe member’s identity can’t change independent of the tribal identity because the member has no independent identity. Let’s call this <strong>blind tribalism.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">With conscious tribalism, the tribe member and his identity comes <em>first</em>. The tribe member’s identity is the alpha dog, and <em>who he is determines the tribes he’s in.</em> With blind tribalism, the tribe comes first. The tribe is the alpha dog and <em>it’s the tribe that determines who he is.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">This isn’t black and white—it’s a spectrum—but when someone is raised without strong reasoning skills, they may also lack a strong independent identity and end up vulnerable to the blind tribalism side of things—especially with the various tribes they were born into. That’s what Einstein was getting at when he said, “Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.”</p><p class=\"p1\">A large tribe like a religion or nation or political party will contain members who fall across the whole range of the blind-to-conscious spectrum. But some tribes themselves will be the type to attract a certain type of follower. It makes logical sense that the more rigid and certain and <em>dogmatic</em> the tribe, the more likely it’ll be to attract blind tribe members. ISIS is going to have a far higher percentage of blind tribe members than the London Philosophy Club.</p><p class=\"p1\">The allure of dogmatic tribes makes sense—they appeal to very core parts of human nature.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans crave connection and camaraderie, and a guiding dogma is a common glue to bond together a group of unique individuals as one.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans want internal security, and for someone who grows up feeling shaky about their own distinctive character, a tribe and its guiding dogma is a critical lifeline—a one-stop shop for a full suite of human opinions and values.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans also long for the comfort and safety of certainty, and nowhere is conviction more present than in the groupthink of blind tribalism. While a scientist’s data-based opinions are only as strong as the evidence she has and inherently subject to change, tribal dogmatism is an exercise in faith, and with no data to be beholden to, blind tribe members believe what they believe with certainty.</p><p class=\"p1\">We discussed why math has proofs, science has theories, and in life, we should probably limit ourselves to hypotheses—but blind tribalism proceeds with the confidence of the mathematician:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (because the tribe says so): </strong>A = B<br /><strong>Given <strong>(because the tribe says so)</strong>:</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore, with certainty:</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">And since so many others in the tribe feel certain about things, your own certainty is reassured and reinforced.</p><p>But there’s a heavy cost to these comforts. Insecurity can be solved the hard way or the easy way—and by giving people the easy option, dogmatic tribes remove the pressure to do the hard work of evolving into a more independent person with a more internally-defined identity. In that way, dogmatic tribes are an <i>enabler</i> of the blind tribe member’s deficiencies.</p><p class=\"p1\">The sneaky thing about both rigid tribal dogma and blind membership is that they like to masquerade as open-minded thought with conscious membership. I think many of us may be closer to the blind membership side of things with certain tribes we’re a part of than we recognize—and those tribes we’re a part of may not be as open-minded as we tend to think.</p><p>A good test for this is the intensity of the <em>us </em>factor. That key word in “People like us do stuff like this” can get you into trouble pretty quickly.</p><p>Us feels great. A major part of the appeal of being in a tribe is that you get to be part of an Us, something humans are wired to seek out. And a loose Us is nice—like the Us among conscious, independent tribe members.</p><p>But the Us in blind tribalism is creepy. In blind tribalism, the tribe’s guiding dogma doubles as the identity of the tribe members, and the Us factor enforces that concept. Conscious tribe members reach conclusions—blind tribe members <em>are</em> conclusions. With a blind Us, if the way you are as an individual happens to contain opinions, traits, or principles that fall outside the outer edges of the dogma walls, they will need to be shed—or things will get ugly. By challenging the dogma of your tribe, you’re challenging both the sense of certainty the tribe members gain their strength from and the clear lines of identity they rely on.</p><p>The best friend of a blind Us is a nemesis Us—<em>Them</em>. Nothing unites Us like a collectively hated anti-Us, and the blind tribe is usually defined almost as much by hating the dogma of Them as it is by abiding by the dogma of Us.</p><p>Whatever element of rigid, identity-encompassing blindness is present in your own tribal life will reveal itself when you dare to validate any part of the rival Them dogma.</p><p>Give it a try. The next time you’re with a member of a tribe you’re a part of, express a change of heart that aligns you on a certain topic with whoever your tribe considers to be Them. If you’re a religious Christian, tell people at church you’re not sure anymore that there’s a God. If you’re an artist in Boulder, explain at the next dinner party that you think global warming might actually be a liberal hoax. If you’re an Iraqi, tell your family that you’re feeling pro-Israel lately. If you and your husband are staunch Republicans, tell him you’re coming around on Obamacare. If you’re from Boston, tell your friends you’re pulling for the Yankees this year because you like their current group of players.</p><p class=\"p1\">If you’re in a tribe with a blind mentality of total certainty, you’ll probably see a look of horror. It won’t just seem wrong, it’ll seem like <em>heresy</em>. They might get angry, they might passionately try to convince you otherwise, they might cut off the conversation—but there will be no open-minded conversation. And because identity is so intertwined with beliefs in blind tribalism, the person actually might feel less close to you afterwards. Because for rigidly tribal people, a shared dogma plays a more important role in their close relationships than they might recognize.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most of the major divides in our world emerge from blind tribalism, and on the extreme end of the spectrum—where people are complete <em>sheep</em>—blind tribalism can lead to terrifying things. Like those times in history when a few charismatic bad guys can build a large army of loyal foot soldiers just by displaying strength and passion. Because blind tribalism is the true villain behind our grandest-scale atrocities:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Equations1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4444 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Equations1.png\" alt=\"Equations\" width=\"597\" height=\"175\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Most of us probably wouldn’t have joined the Nazi party, because most of us aren’t on the extreme end of the blind-to-conscious spectrum. But I don’t think many of us are on the <em>other</em> end either. Instead, we’re usually somewhere in the hazy middle—in the land of cooks.<a href=\"#footnote-5-4367\" id=\"note-5-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>The Cook and the Chef</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">The difference between the way Elon thinks and the way most people think is kind of like the difference between a cook and a chef.</p><p class=\"p1\">The words “cook” and “chef” seem kind of like synonyms. And in the real world, they’re often used interchangeably. But in this post, when I say chef, I don’t mean any ordinary chef. I mean the <em>trailblazing chef—</em>the kind of chef who <em>invents</em> recipes. And for our purposes, everyone else who enters a kitchen—all those who <em>follow</em> recipes—is a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">Everything you eat—every part of every cuisine we know so well—was at some point in the past created for the <em>first time</em>. Wheat, tomatoes, salt, and milk go back a long time, but at some point, <em>someone</em> said, “What if I take those ingredients and do this…and this…..and this……” and ended up with the world’s first pizza. That’s the work of a chef.</p><p class=\"p1\">Since then, god knows how many people have made a pizza. That’s the work of a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">The chef reasons from first principles, and for the chef, the first principles are raw edible ingredients. Those are her puzzle pieces, her building blocks, and she works her way upwards from there, using her experience, her instincts, and her taste buds.</p><p class=\"p1\">The cook works off of some version of what’s already out there—a recipe of some kind, a meal she tried and liked, a dish she watched someone else make.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cooks span a wide range. On one end, you have cooks who only cook by following a recipe to the T<em>—</em>carefully measuring every ingredient exactly the way the recipe dictates. The result is a delicious meal that tastes exactly the way the recipe has it designed. Down the range a bit, you have more of a confident cook—someone with experience who gets the general gist of the recipe and then uses her skills and instincts to do it her own way. The result is something a little more unique to her style that tastes like the recipe but not quite. At the far end of the cook range, you have an innovator who makes her own concoctions. A lamb burger with a vegetable bun, a peanut butter and jelly pizza, a cinnamon pumpkin seed cake.<a href=\"#footnote-6-4367\" id=\"note-6-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p class=\"p1\">But what all of these cooks have in common is their starting point is something that already exists. Even the innovative cook is still making an iteration of a burger, a pizza, and a cake.</p><p class=\"p1\">At the very end of the spectrum, you have the chef. A chef might make good food or terrible food, but whatever she makes, it’s a result of her own reasoning process, from the selection of raw ingredients at the bottom to the finished dish at the top.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Spectrum2.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4456 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Spectrum2.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Spectrum\" width=\"598\" height=\"219\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">In the culinary world, there’s nothing wrong with being a cook. Most people are cooks because for most people, inventing recipes isn’t a goal of theirs.</p><p class=\"p1\">But in life—when it comes to the reasoning “recipes” we use to churn out a decision—we may want to think twice about where we are on the cook-chef spectrum.</p><p class=\"p1\">On a typical day, a “reasoning cook” and a “reasoning chef” don’t operate that differently. Even the chef becomes quickly exhausted by the mental energy required for first principles reasoning, and usually, doing so isn’t worth his time. Both types of people spend an average day with their brain software running on auto-pilot and their conscious decision-making centers dormant.</p><p class=\"p1\">But then comes a day when something new needs to be figured out. Maybe the cook and the chef are each given the new task at work to create a better marketing strategy. Or maybe they’re unhappy with that job and want to think of what business to start. Maybe they have a crush on someone they never expected to have feelings for and they need to figure out what to do about it.</p><p class=\"p1\">Whatever this new situation is, auto-pilot won’t suffice—this is something new and neither the chef’s nor the cook’s software has done this before. Which leaves only two options:</p><p class=\"p1\">Create. Or copy.</p><p class=\"p1\">The chef says, “Ugh okay, here we go,” rolls up his sleeves, and does what he always does in these situations—he switches on the active decision-making part of his software and starts to go to work. He looks at what data he has and seeks out what more he needs. He thinks about the current state of the world and reflects on where his values and priorities lie. He gathers together those relevant first principles ingredients and starts puzzling together a reasoning pathway. It takes some hard work, but eventually, the pathway brings him to a hypothesis. He knows it’s probably wrong-ish, and as new data emerges, he’ll “taste-test” the hypothesis and adjust it. He keeps the decision-making center on standby for the next few weeks as he makes a bunch of early adjustments to the flawed hypothesis—a little more salt, a little less sugar, one prime ingredient that needs to be swapped out for another. Eventually, he’s satisfied enough with how things are going to move back into auto-pilot mode. This new decision is now part of the automated routine—a new recipe is in the cookbook—and he’ll check in on it to make adjustments every once in a while or as new pertinent data comes in, the way he does for all parts of his software.</p><p class=\"p1\">The cook has no idea what’s going on in the last paragraph. The reasoning cook’s software is called “Because the recipe said so,” and it’s more of a computerized catalog of recipes than a computer program. When the cook needs to make a life decision, he goes through his collection of authority-written recipes, finds the one he trusts in that particular walk of life, and reads through the steps to see what to do—kind of like WWJD, except the J is replaced by whatever authority is most trusted in that area. For most questions, the authority is the tribe, since the cook’s tribal dogma covers most standard decisions. But in this particular case, the cook leafed through the tribe’s cookbook and couldn’t find any section about this type of decision. So he needs to get a hold of a recipe from another authority he trusts with this type of thing. Once the cook finds the right recipe, he can put it in his catalog and use it for all future decisions on this matter.</p><p class=\"p1\">First, the cook tries a few friends. His catalog doesn’t have the needed info, but maybe one of theirs does. He asks them for their advice—not so he can use it as additional thinking to supplement his own, but so it can <em>become </em>his own thinking.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that doesn’t yield any strongly-opinionated results, he’ll go to the trusty eternal backstop—conventional wisdom.</p><p class=\"p1\">Society as a whole is its own loose tribe, often spanning your whole nation or even your whole part of the world, and what we call “conventional wisdom” is its guiding dogma cookbook—online and available to the public. Typically, the larger the tribe, the more general and more outdated the dogma—and the conventional wisdom database runs like a DMV website last updated in 1992. But when the cook has nowhere else to turn, it’s like a trusty old friend.</p><p class=\"p1\">And in this case—let’s say the cook is thinking of starting a business and wants to know what the possibilities are—conventional wisdom has him covered. He types the command into the interface, waits a few minutes, and then the system pumps out its answer:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CWDOS1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4447 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CWDOS1.png\" alt=\"CWDOS\" width=\"562\" height=\"403\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The cook, thoroughly discouraged, thanks the machine and updates his Reality box accordingly.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cook-reality-box-simple.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4445 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cook-reality-box-simple.png\" alt=\"Cook reality box simple\" width=\"282\" height=\"249\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">With the decision made (not to start a business), he switches his software back into auto-pilot mode. Done and done.</p><p class=\"p1\">Musk calls the cook’s way of thinking “reasoning by analogy” (as opposed to reasoning by first principles), which is a nice euphemism. The next time a kid gets caught copying answers from another student’s exam during the test, he should just explain that he was reasoning by analogy.</p><p class=\"p1\">If you start looking for it, you’ll see the chef/cook thing happening everywhere. There are chefs and cooks in the worlds of music, art, technology, architecture,<a href=\"#footnote-7-4367\" id=\"note-7-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> writing, business, comedy, marketing, app development, football coaching, teaching, and military strategy. And in each case, though both parties are usually just on autopilot, mindlessly playing the latest album again and again at concerts, it’s in those key moments when it’s time to <em>write </em>a new album—those moments of truth in front of a clean canvas, a blank Word doc, an empty playbook, a new sheet of blueprint paper, a fresh whiteboard—that the chef and the cook reveal their true colors. The chef creates while the cook, in some form or another, copies.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Line-of-cooks.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4395 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Line-of-cooks.png\" alt=\"Line of cooks\" width=\"515\" height=\"355\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">And the difference in outcome is enormous. For cooks, even the more innovative kind, there’s almost always a ceiling on the size of the splash they can make in the world, unless there’s some serious luck involved. Chefs aren’t guaranteed to do anything good, but when there’s a little talent and a lot of persistence, they’re almost certain<em> </em>to make a splash. Sometimes the chef is the one brave enough to go for something big—but other times, someone doesn’t feel the desire to make a splash and the chef is the one with the strength of character to step out of the game and in favor of keeping it small. Being a chef isn’t being like Elon Musk—it’s being yourself.</p><p class=\"p1\">No one talks about the “reasoning industry,” but we’re all part of it, and when it comes to chefs and cooks, it’s no different than any other industry. We’re working in the reasoning industry every time we make a decision.</p><p class=\"p1\">Your current life, with all its facets and complexity, is like a reasoning industry album. The question is, how did that set of songs come to be? How were the songs composed, and by whom? And in those critical do-or-die moments when it’s time to write a new song, how do you do your creating? Do you dig deep into yourself? Do you start with the drumbeat and chords of an existing song and write your own melody on top of it? Do you just play covers?</p><p class=\"p1\">I know what you <em>want </em>the answers to these questions to be. This is a straightforward one—it’s clearly better to be a chef. But unlike the case with most major distinctions in life—hard-working vs. lazy, ethical vs. dishonest, considerate vs. selfish—when the chef/cook distinction passes right in front of us, we often don’t even notice it’s there.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Missing the Distinction</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Like the culinary world’s cook-to-chef range, the real world’s cook-to-chef range isn’t binary—it lies on a spectrum:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4529\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum3.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Life Spectrum\" width=\"600\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">But I’m pretty sure that when most of us look at that spectrum, we <em>think </em>we’re farther to the right than we actually are. We’re usually more cook-like than we realize—we just can’t see it from where we’re standing.</p><p class=\"p1\">For example—</p><p class=\"p1\">Cooks are followers—by definition. They’re a cook because in whatever they’re doing, they’re following some kind of recipe. But most of us don’t think of ourselves as followers.</p><p class=\"p1\">A follower, we think, is a weakling with no mind of their own. We think about leadership positions we’ve held and initiatives we’ve taken at work and the way we never let friends boss us around, and we take these as evidence that we’re no follower. Which in turn means that we’re not just a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the problem is—the only thing all of that proves is that you’re no follower <em>within your tribe</em>. As Einstein meanly put it:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, you might be a star and a leader in your world or in the eyes of your part of society, but if the core reason you picked that goal in the first place was because your tribe’s cookbook says that it’s an impressive thing and it makes the other tribe members gawk, <em>you’re not being a leader—you’re being a super-successful follower. </em>And, as Einstein says, no less of a cook than all those whom you’ve impressed.</p><p class=\"p1\">To see the truth, you need to zoom way out until you can see the real leader of the cooks—the cookbook.</p><p>But we don’t tend to zoom out, and when we look around at our life, zoomed in, what appears to be a highly unique and independent self may be an optical illusion.<a href=\"#footnote-8-4367\" id=\"note-8-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> What often feels like independent reasoning when zoomed out is actually playing connect-the-dots on a pre-printed set of steps laid out by someone else. What feels like personal principles might just be the general tenets of your tribe. What feels like original opinions may have actually been spoon-fed to us by the media or our parents or friends or our religion or a celebrity. What feels like Roark might actually be Keating. What feels like our chosen life path could just be one of a handful of pre-set, tribe-approved yellow brick roads. What feels like creativity might be filling in a coloring book—and making sure to stay inside the lines.</p><p>Because of this optical illusion, we’re unable to see the flaws in our own thinking or recognize an unusually great thinker when we see one. Instead, when a superbly science-minded, independent-thinking chef like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein comes around, what do we attribute their success to?</p><p>Awesome fucking hardware.</p><p>When we look at Musk, we see someone with genius, with vision, with superhuman balls. All things, we assume, he was more or less born with. So to us, the spectrum looks more like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum-Skewed1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4455 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum-Skewed1.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Life Spectrum Skewed\" width=\"598\" height=\"219\" /></a></p><p>The way we see it, we’re all a bunch of independent-thinking chefs—and it’s just that Musk is a really impressive chef.</p><p>Which is both A) overrating Musk and B) overrating ourselves. And <em>completely</em> missing the real story.</p><p>Musk is an impressive chef for sure, but what makes him such an extreme standout isn’t that he’s impressive—<em>it’s that most of us aren’t chefs at all.</em></p><p>It’s like a bunch of typewriters looking at a computer and saying, “Man, that is one talented typewriter.”</p><p>The reason we have such a hard time seeing what’s really going on is that we don’t get that brain software is even a <em>thing</em>. We don’t think of brains as computers, so we don’t think about the distinction between hardware and software at all. When we think about the brain, we think only about the hardware—the thing we’re born with and are powerless to change or improve. Much less tangible to us is the concept of how we reason. We see reasoning as a thing that just kind of <em>happens</em>, like our bodies’ blood flow—it’s a process that automatically happens, and there’s not much else to say or do about it.</p><p>And if we can’t even see the hardware/software distinction, we certainly can’t see the more nuanced chef software vs. cook software distinction.</p><p>By not seeing our thinking software for what it is—a <em>critical </em>life skill, something that can be learned, practiced, and improved, and the major factor that separates the people who do great things from those who don’t—we fail to realize where the game of life is really being played. We don’t recognize reasoning as a thing that can be created or copied—and in the same way that causes us to mistake our own cook-like behavior for independent reasoning, we then mistake the actual independent reasoning of the chef for exceptional and magical abilities.</p><p>Three examples:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) We mistake the chef’s clear view of the present for vision into the future.</strong></span></p><p>Musk’s sister Tosca said “Elon has already gone to the future and come back to tell us what he’s found.”<a href=\"#footnote2-9-4367\" id=\"note2-9-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> This is how a lot of people feel about Musk—that he’s a visionary, that he can somehow see things we cannot. We see it like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4458 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-1.jpg\" alt=\"Musk Visionary 1\" width=\"519\" height=\"266\" /></a></p><p>But actually, it’s like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4459 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-2.jpg\" alt=\"Musk Visionary 2\" width=\"516\" height=\"291\" /></a></p><p>Conventional wisdom is slow to move, and there’s significant lag time between when something becomes reality and when conventional wisdom is revised to reflect that reality. And by the time it does, reality has moved on to something else. But chefs don’t pay attention to that, reasoning instead using their eyes and ears and experience. By ignoring conventional wisdom in favor of simply looking at the present for what it really is and staying up-to-date with the facts of the world as they change in real-time—in spite of what conventional wisdom has to say—the chef can act on information the rest of us haven’t been given permission to act on yet.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) We mistake the chef’s accurate understanding of risk for courage.</strong></span></p><p>Remember this ElonSpeak quote from earlier?</p><p><em>When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it’s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn’t afraid of the dark anymore after that.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-10-4367\" id=\"note2-10-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p>That’s just a kid chef assessing the actual facts of a situation and deciding that his fear was misplaced.</p><p>As an adult, Musk said this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Sometimes people fear starting a company too much. Really, what’s the worst that could go wrong? You’re not gonna starve to death, you’re not gonna die of exposure—what’s the worst that could go wrong?</em><a href=\"#footnote2-11-4367\" id=\"note2-11-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p>Same quote, right?</p><p>In both cases, Musk is essentially saying, “People consider X to be scary, but their fear is not based on logic, so I’m not scared of X.” That’s not courage—that’s logic.</p><p>Courage means doing something risky. Risk means exposing yourself to danger. We intuitively understand this—that’s why most of us wouldn’t call child Elon <em>courageous </em>for sleeping with the lights off. Courage would be a weird word to use there because no actual danger was involved.</p><p>All Elon’s saying in the second quote is that being scared to start a company is the adult version of being scared of the dark. It’s not actually dangerous.</p><p>So when Musk put his entire fortune down and on SpaceX and Tesla, he was being bold as fuck, but courageous? Not the right word. It was a case of a chef taking a bunch of information he had and puzzling together a plan that seemed logical. It’s not that he was sure he’d succeed—in fact, he thought SpaceX in particular had a reasonable probability of failure—it’s just that nowhere in his assessments did he foresee <em>danger</em>.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3) We mistake the chef’s originality for brilliant ingenuity. </strong></span></p><p>People believe thinking outside the box takes intelligence and creativity, but it’s mostly about independence. When you simply ignore the box and build your reasoning from scratch, whether you’re brilliant or not, you end up with a unique conclusion—one that may or may not fall within the box.</p><p>When you’re in a foreign country and you decide to ditch the guidebook and start wandering aimlessly and talking to people, unique things always end up happening. When people hear about those things, they think of you as a pro traveler and a bold adventurer—when all you really did is ditch the guidebook.</p><p>Likewise, when an artist or scientist or businessperson chef reasons independently instead of by analogy, and their puzzling happens to both A) turn out well and B) end up outside the box, people call it innovation and marvel at the chef’s ingenuity. When it turns out <em>really </em>well, all the cooks do what they do best—copy—and now it’s called a revolution.</p><p>Simply by refraining from reasoning by analogy, the chef opens up the possibility of making a huge splash with every project. When Steve Jobs<a href=\"#footnote-9-4367\" id=\"note-9-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> and Apple turned their attention to phones, they didn’t start by saying, “Okay well people seem to like this kind of keyboard more than that kind, and everyone seems unhappy with the difficulty of hitting the numbers on their keyboards—so let’s get creative and make the best phone keyboard yet!” They simply asked, “What should a mobile device be?” and in their from-scratch reasoning, a physical keyboard didn’t end up as part of the plan at all. It didn’t take genius to come up with the design of the iPhone—it’s actually pretty logical—it just took the ability to not copy.</p><p>Different version of the same story with the invention of the United States. When the American forefathers found themselves with a new country on their hands, they didn’t ask, “What should the rules be for selecting our king, and what should the limitations of his power be?” A king to them was what a physical keyboard was to Apple. Instead, they asked, “What should a country be and what’s the best way to govern a group of people?” and by the time they had finished their puzzling, a king wasn’t part of the picture—their first principles reasoning led them to believe that John Locke had a better plan and they worked their way up from there.</p><p>History is full of the stories of chefs creating revolutions of apparent ingenuity through simple first principles reasoning. Genghis Khan organizing a smattering of tribes that had been fragmented for centuries using a <a href=\"http://www.alanculler.com/Genghis%20Khan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">powers of ten system</a> in order to build one grand tribe that could sweep the world. Henry Ford creating cars with the out-of-the-box manufacturing technique of assembly-line production in order to bring cars to the masses for the first time. Marie Curie using unconventional methods to pioneer the theory of radioactivity and topple the “atoms are indivisible” assumption on its head (she won a Nobel Prize in both physics and chemistry—two prizes reserved exclusively for chefs). Martin Luther King taking a nonviolent Thoreau approach to a situation normally addressed by riots. Larry Page and Sergey Brin ignoring the commonly-used methods of searching the internet in favor of what they saw as a more logical system that based page importance on the number of important sites that linked to it. The 1966 Beatles deciding to stop being the world’s best cooks, ditching the typical songwriting styles of early-60s bands, including their own, and become music chefs, creating a bunch of new types of songs from scratch that no one had heard before.</p><p>Whatever the time, place, or industry, anytime something <em>really </em>big happens, there’s almost always an experimenting chef at the center of it—not being anything magical, just trusting their brain and working from scratch. Our world, like our cuisines, was created by these people—the rest of us are just along for the ride.</p><p>Yeah, Musk is smart as fuck and insanely ambitious—but that’s not why he’s beating everybody. What makes Musk so rad is that he’s a software outlier. A chef in a world of cooks. A science geologist in a world of flood geologists. A brain software pro in a world where people don’t realize brain software is a thing.</p><p>That’s Elon Musk’s secret sauce.</p><p>Which is why the real story here isn’t Musk. It’s us.</p><p>The real puzzle in this series isn’t why Elon Musk is trying to end the era of gas cars or why he’s trying to land a rocket or why he cares so much about colonizing Mars—it’s why Elon Musk is so <em>rare</em>.</p><p>The curious thing about the car industry isn’t why Tesla is focusing so hard on electric cars, and the curious thing about the aerospace industry isn’t why SpaceX is trying so hard to make rockets reusable—the fascinating question is why they’re the only companies doing so.</p><p>We spent this whole time trying to figure out the mysterious workings of the mind of a madman genius only to realize that Musk’s secret sauce is that he’s the only one being normal. And in isolation, Musk would be a pretty boring subject—it’s the backdrop of <em>us</em> that makes him interesting. And it’s that backdrop that this series is really about.</p><p>So…what’s the deal with us? How did we end up so scared and cook-like? And how do we learn to be more like the chefs of the world, who seem to so effortlessly carve their own way through life? I think it comes down to three things.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>How to Be a Chef</strong></span></p><p>Anytime there’s a curious phenomenon within humanity—some collective insanity we’re all suffering from—it usually ends up being evolution’s fault. This story is no different.</p><p class=\"p1\">When it comes to reasoning, we’re biologically inclined to be cooks, not chefs, which relates back to our tribal evolutionary past. First, it’s a better tribal model for most people to be cooks. In 50,000 BC, tribes full of independent thinkers probably suffered from having too many chefs in the kitchen, which would lead to too many arguments and factions within the tribe. A tribe with a strong leader at the top and the rest of the members simply following the leader would fare better. So those types of tribes passed on their genes more than other tribes. And now we’re the collective descendants of the more cook-like people.</p><p>Second, it’s about our own well-being. It’s not in our DNA to be chefs because human self-preservation never depended upon independent thinking—it rode on fitting in with the tribe, on staying in favor with the chief, on following in the footsteps of the elders who knew more about staying alive than we did, and on teaching our children to do the same—which is why we now live in a cook society where cook parents raise their kids by telling them to follow the recipe and stop asking questions about it.</p><p>Thinking like cooks is what we’re born to do because what we’re born to do is survive.</p><p>But the weird thing is, we weren’t born into a normal human world. We’re living in the anomaly, when for many of the world’s people, survival is easy. Today’s privileged societies are full of anomaly humans whose primary purpose is already taken care of, softening the deafening roar of unmet base needs and allowing the nuanced and complex voice of our inner selves to awaken.</p><p>The problem is, most of our heads are still running on some version of the 50,000-year-old survival software—which kind of wastes the good luck we have to be born now.</p><p>It’s an unfortunate catch-22—we continue to think like cooks because we can’t absorb the epiphany that we live in an anomaly world where there’s no need to be cooks, and we can’t absorb that epiphany because we think like cooks and cooks don’t know how to challenge and update their own software.</p><p>This is the vicious cycle of our time—and the secret of the chef is that they somehow snapped out of it.</p><p>So how do we snap out of the trance?</p><p>I think there are three major epiphanies we need to absorb—three core things the chef knows that the cook doesn’t:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 1) You don’t know shit.</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/You-dont-know-shit.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4403 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/You-dont-know-shit.png\" alt=\"You don't know shit\" width=\"316\" height=\"278\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The flood geologists of the 17th and 18th centuries weren’t stupid. And they weren’t anti-science. Many of them were just as accomplished in their fields as their science geologist colleagues.</p><p>But they were victims—victims of a religious dogma they were told to believe without question. The recipe they followed was scripture, a recipe that turned out to be wrong. And as a result, they proceeded on their path with a fatal flaw in their thinking—a software bug that told them that one of the undeniable first principles when thinking about the Earth was that it began 6,000 years ago and that there had been a flood of the most epic proportions.</p><p>With that software bug in place, all further computations were moot. Any reasoning tree that puzzled upwards with those assumptions at its root had no chance of finding truth.</p><p>Even more than being victims of any dogma, the flood geologists were victims of their own certainty. Without certainty, dogma has no power. And when data is required in order to believe something, false dogma has no legs to stand on. It wasn’t the church dogma<em> </em>that hindered the flood geologists, it was the church <em>mentality</em> of faith-based certainty.</p><p>That’s what Stephen Hawking meant when he said, “The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.” Neither the science geologist nor the flood geologist started off with knowledge. But what gave the science geologist the power to seek out the truth was <em>knowing </em>that he lacked knowledge. The science geologists subscribed to the <em>lab</em> mentality, which starts by saying “I don’t know shit” and works upwards from there.</p><p>If you want to see the lab mentality at work, just search for famous quotes of any prominent scientist and you’ll see each one of them expressing the fact that they don’t know shit.</p><p>Here’s Isaac Newton: <em>To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.</em></p><p>And Richard Feynman: <em>I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.</em></p><p>And Niels Bohr: <i>Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.</i></p><p>Musk has said his own version: <em>You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-12-4367\" id=\"note2-12-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p>The reason these outrageously smart people are so humble about what they know is that as scientists, they’re aware that unjustified certainty is the bane of understanding and the death of effective reasoning. They firmly believe that reasoning of all kinds should take place in a lab, not a church.</p><p>If we want to become more chef-like, we have to make sure we’re doing our thinking in a lab. Which means identifying which parts of our thinking are currently sitting in church.</p><p>But that’s a hard thing to do because m<span class=\"s1\">ost of us have the same relationship with our own software that my grandmother has with her computer:<a href=\"#footnote-10-4367\" id=\"note-10-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> It’s this thing someone put there, we use it when we need to, it somehow magically works, and we hope it doesn’t break. It’s the way we are with a lot of the things we own, where we’re just the dumb user, not the pro. We know how to use our car, microwave, phone, our electric toothbrush, but if something breaks, we take it to the pro to fix it because we have no idea how it works.</span></p><p>But that’s not a great life model when it comes to brain software, and it usually leads to us making the same mistakes and living with the same results year after year after year, because our software remains unchanged. Eventually, we might wake up one day feeling like <i>Breaking Bad’s </i>Walter White, when he said, “Sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own… choices. I mean, my entire life it just seems I never… had a real say about any of it.” If we want to understand our own thinking, we have to stop being the dumb user of our own software and start being the pro—the auto mechanic, the electrician, the computer geek.</p><p>If you were alone in a room with a car and wanted to figure out how it worked, you’d probably start by taking it apart as much as you could and examining the parts and how they all fit together. To do the same with our thinking, we need to revert to our four-year-old selves and start deconstructing our software by resuming the Why game our parents and teachers shut down decades ago. It’s time to roll up our sleeves, pop open the hood, and get our hands dirty with a bunch of not-that-fun questions about what we truly want, what’s truly possible, and whether the way we’re living our lives follows logically from those things.</p><p>With each of these questions, the challenge is to keep asking why until you hit the floor—and the floor is what will tell you whether you’re in a church or a lab for that particular part of your life. If a floor you hit is one or more first principles that represent the truth of reality or your inner self and the logic going upwards stays accurate to that foundation, you’re in the lab. If a Why? pathway hits a floor called “Because [authority] said so”—if you go down and down and realize at the bottom that the whole thing is just because you’re taking your parent’s or friend’s or religion’s or society’s word for it—then you’re in church there. And if the tenets of that church don’t truly resonate with you or reflect the current reality of the world—if it turns out that you’ve been working off of the wrong recipe—then whatever conclusions have been built on top of it will be just as wrong. As demonstrated by the flood geologists, a reasoning chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4465 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-1.jpg\" alt=\"False Dogma 1\" width=\"363\" height=\"386\" /></a></p><p>Astronomers once hit a similar wall in their progress trying to calculate the trajectories of the sun and planets in the Solar System. Then one day they discovered that the sun was at the center of things, not the Earth, and suddenly, all the perplexing calculations made sense, and progress leapt forward. Had they played the Why game earlier, they’d have run into a dogmatic floor right after the question “But why do we know that the Earth is in the center of everything?”</p><p>People’s lives are no different, which is why it’s so important to find the toxic lumps of false dogma tucked inside the layers of your reasoning software. Identifying one and adjusting it can strengthen the whole chain above and create a breakthrough in your life.</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-4466 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-2.jpg\" alt=\"False Dogma 2\" width=\"364\" height=\"386\" /></p><p>The thing you really want to look closely for is unjustified certainty. Where in life do you feel so right about something that it doesn’t qualify as a hypothesis or even a theory, but it feels like a <em>proof?</em> When there’s proof-level certainty, it means either there’s some serious concrete and verified data underneath it—or it’s faith-based dogma. Maybe you feel certain that quitting your job would be a disaster or certain that there’s no god or certain that it’s important to go to college or certain that you’ve always had a great time on rugged vacations or certain that everyone loves it when you break out the guitar during a group hangout—but if it’s not well backed-up by data from what you’ve learned and experienced, it’s at best a hypothesis and at worst a completely false piece of dogma.</p><p>And if thinking about all of that ends with you drowning in some combination of self-doubt, self-loathing, and identity crisis, that’s perfect. This first epiphany is about humility. Humility is by definition a starting point—and it sends you off on a journey from there. The arrogance of certainty is both a starting point and an ending point—no journeys needed. That’s why it’s so important that we begin with “I don’t know shit.” That’s when we know we’re in the lab.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 2) No one else knows shit

18\" width=\"500\" height=\"612\" /></a></p><p>Yes, it’s an old classic. The Emperor’s New Clothes. It was written in 1837 by Hans Christian Andersen<a href=\"#footnote-11-4367\" id=\"note-11-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> to demonstrate a piece of trademark human insanity: the “This doesn’t seem right to me but everyone else says it’s right so it must be right and I’ll just pretend I also think it’s right so no one realizes I’m stupid” phenomenon.</p><p>My favorite all-time quote might be Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEiSa6_EPA\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> this:</p><p><em>When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.</em><a href=\"#footnote-12-4367\" id=\"note-12-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a><p>This is Jobs’ way of saying, “You might not know shit. But <em>no </em>one knows shit. If the emperor looks naked to you and everyone else is saying he has clothes, trust your eyes since other people don’t know anything you don’t.”</p><p>It’s an easy message to understand, a harder one to believe, and an even harder one to act on.</p><p>The purpose of the first epiphany is to shatter the belief that all that dogma you’ve memorized constitutes personal opinions and wisdom and all that certainty you feel constitutes knowledge and understanding. That’s the easier one because the delusion that we know what we’re talking about is pretty fragile, with the “Oh god I’m a fraud who doesn’t know shit” monster never lurking too far under our consciousness.</p><p>But this epiphany—that the collective “other people” and their conventional wisdom don’t know shit—is a much larger challenge. Our delusion about the wisdom of those around us, our tribe, and society as a whole is much thicker and runs much deeper than the delusion about ourselves. So deep that we’ll see a naked emperor and ignore our own eyes if everyone else says he has clothes on.</p><p>This is a battle of two kinds of confidence—confidence in others vs. confidence in ourselves. For most cooks, confidence in others usually comes out the winner.</p><p>To swing the balance, we need to figure out how to <em>lose respect</em> for the general public, your tribe’s dogma, and society’s conventional wisdom. We have a bunch of romantic words for the world’s chefs that sound impressive but are actually just a result of them having lost this respect. Being a <em>gamechanger </em>is just having little enough respect for the game that you realize there’s no good reason not to change the rules. Being a <em>trailblazer</em> is just not respecting the beaten path and so deciding to blaze yourself a new one. Being a <em>groundbreaker</em> is just knowing that the ground wasn’t laid by anyone that impressive and so feeling no need to keep it intact.</p><p>Not respecting society is totally counterintuitive to what we’re taught when we grow up—but it makes perfect sense if you just look at what your eyes and experience tell you.</p><p>There are clues all around showing us that conventional wisdom doesn’t know shit. Conventional wisdom worships the status quo and always assumes that everything is the way it is for a good reason—and history is one long record of status quo dogma being proven wrong again and again, every time some chef comes around and changes things.</p><p>And if you open your eyes, there are other clues all through your own life that the society you live in is nothing to be intimidated by. All the times you learn about what really goes on inside a company and find out that it’s totally disorganized and badly run. All the people in high places who can’t seem to get their personal lives together. All the well-known sitcoms whose jokes you’re pretty sure you could have written when you were 14. All the politicians who don’t seem to know more about the world than you do.</p><p>And yet, the delusion that society knows shit that you don’t runs deep, and still, somewhere in the back of your head, you don’t think it’s realistic that you<em> </em>could ever actually build that company, achieve that fabulous wealth or celebrity-status, create that TV show, win that senate campaign—no matter what<em> </em>it <em>seems</em> like.</p><p>Sometimes it takes an actual experience to fully expose society for the shit it doesn’t know. One example from my life is how I slowly came to understand that most Americans—the broader public, my tribe, and people I know well—knew very little about what it’s actually like to visit most countries. I grew up hearing about how dangerous it was to visit really foreign places, especially alone. But when I started going places I wasn’t supposed to go, I kept finding that the conventional wisdom had been plain wrong about it. As I had more experiences and gathered more actual data, I grew increasingly trusting of my own reasoning over whatever Americans were saying. And as my confidence grew, places like Thailand and Spain turned into places like Oman and Uzbekistan which turned into places like Nigeria and North Korea. When it comes to traveling, I had the epiphany: other people’s strong opinions about this are based on unbacked-up dogma and the fact that most people I talk to feel the same way means nothing if my own research, experience, and selective question-asking brings me to a different conclusion.<a href=\"#footnote-13-4367\" id=\"note-13-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a> When it comes to picking travel destinations, I’ve become a chef.</p><p>I try to leverage what I learned as a traveler to transfer the chefness elsewhere—when I find myself discouraged in another part of my life by the warnings and head-shaking of conventional wisdom, I try to remind myself: <em>“These are the same people that were sure that North Korea was dangerous.” </em>It’s hard—you have to take the leap to chefdom separately in each part of your life—but it seems like with each successive cook → chef breakthrough, future breakthroughs become easier to come by. <span class=\"s1\">Eventually, you must hit a tipping point and trusting your own software becomes your way of life—and as Jobs says, you’ll never be the same again.</span></p><p>The first epiphany was about shattering a protective shell of arrogance to lay bare a starting point of humility. This second epiphany is about confidence—the confidence to emerge from that humility through a pathway built on first principles instead of by analogy. It’s a confidence that says, “I may not know much, but no one else does either, so I might as well be the most knowledgeable person on Earth.”</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 3) You’re playing Grand Theft Life</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grand-Theft-Life.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4394 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grand-Theft-Life.png\" alt=\"Grand Theft Life\" width=\"270\" height=\"298\" /></a></p><p>The first two epiphanies allow us to break open our software, identify which parts of it were put there by someone else, and with confidence begin to fill in the Want and Reality boxes with our own handwriting and choose a goal and a strategy that’s right for us.</p><p>But then we hit a snag. We’re finally in the lab with all our tools and equipment, but something holds us back. To figure out why, let’s bring back our emperor story.</p><p>When the emperor struts out with his shoulder hair and his gut and his little white junk, the story only identifies two kinds of people: the mass of subjects, who all pretend they can see the clothes, and the kid, who just says that the dude is obviously naked.</p><p>But I think there’s more going on. In an emperor’s new clothes situation, there are <em>four </em>kinds of people:</p><p><strong>1) Proud Cook. </strong>Proud Cook is the person drinking the full dogma Kool-Aid. Whatever independent-thinking voice <em>is</em> inside of Proud Cook was silenced long ago, and there’s no distinction between his thoughts and the dogma he follows. As far as he’s concerned, the dogma is truth—but since he doesn’t even register that there’s any dogma happening, Proud Cook simply thinks he’s a very wise person who has it all figured out. He feels the certainty of the dogma running through his veins. When the emperor walks out and proclaims that he is wearing beautiful new clothes, Proud Cook actually <em>sees</em> clothes, because his consciousness isn’t even turned on.</p><p><strong>2) Insecure Cook. </strong>Insecure Cook is what Proud Cook turns into after undergoing Epiphany #1. Insecure Cook has had a splash of self-awareness—enough to become conscious of the fact that he doesn’t actually know why he’s so certain about the things he’s certain about. Whatever the reasons are, he’s sure they’re right, but he can’t seem to come up with them himself. Without the blissful arrogance of Proud Cook, Insecure Cook is lost in the world, wondering why he’s too dumb to get what everyone else gets and trying to watch others to figure out what he’s supposed to do—all while hoping nobody finds out that he doesn’t get it. When Insecure Cook sees the emperor, his heart sinks—he doesn’t <em>see </em>the clothes, only the straggly gray hairs of the emperor’s upper thighs. Ashamed, he reads the crowd and mimics their enthusiasm for the clothes.</p><p><strong>3) Self-Loathing Cook. </strong>Self-Loathing Cook is what Insecure Cook becomes after being hit by Epiphany #2. Epiphany #2 is the forbidden fruit, and Self-Loathing Cook has bitten it. He now knows <em>exactly </em>why he didn’t feel certain about everything—because it was all bullshit. He sees the tenets of conventional wisdom for what they really are—faith-based dogma. He knows that neither he nor anyone else knows shit and that he’ll get much farther riding his own reasoning than jumping on the bandwagon with the masses. When the emperor emerges, Self-Loathing Cook thinks, “Oh Jesus…this fucktard is actually outside with no clothes on. Oh—oh and my god these idiots are all <em>pretending to see clothes</em>. How is this my life? I need to move.”</p><p>But then, right when he’s about to call everyone out on their pretending and the emperor out on his bizarre life decision, there’s a lump in his throat. Sure, he knows there are no clothes on that emperor’s sweaty lower back fat roll—but actually <em>saying</em> that? Out <em>loud?</em> I mean, he’s sure and all—but let’s not go crazy here. Better not to call too much attention to himself. And of course, there’s a <em>chance</em> he’s missing something. Right?</p><p>Self-Loathing Cook ends up staying quiet and nodding at the other cooks when they ask him if those clothes aren’t just the most marvelous he’s ever seen.</p><p><b>4) The chef. </b>The kid in the story. The chef is Self-Loathing Cook—except without the irrational fear. The chef goes through the same inner thought process as Self-Loathing Cook, but when it’s time to walk the walk, the chef stands up and yells out the truth.</p><p>A visual recap:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-Subjects.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4382\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-Subjects.png\" alt=\"4 Subjects\" width=\"650\" height=\"333\" /></a></p><p>We’re all human and we’re all complex, which means that in various parts of each of our lives, we play each of these four characters.</p><p>But to me, Self-Loathing Cook is the most curious one of the four. Self-Loathing Cook gets it. He knows what the chefs know. He’s tantalizingly close to carving out his own chef path in the world, and he knows that if he just <em>goes</em> for it, good things would happen. But he can’t pull the trigger. He built himself a pair of wings he feels confident work just fine, but he can’t bring himself to jump off the cliff.</p><p>And as he stands there next to the cliff with the other cooks, he has to endure the torture of watching the chefs of the world leap off the edge with the same exact wings and flying skills he has, but with the courage he can’t seem to find.</p><p>To figure out what’s going on with Self-Loathing Cook, let’s remind ourselves how the chefs operate.</p><p>Free of Self-Loathing Cook’s trepidation, the world’s chefs are liberated to put on their lab coats and start sciencing. To a chef, the world is one giant laboratory, and their life is one long lab session full of a million experiments. They spend their days puzzling, and society is their game board.</p><p>The chef treats his goals and undertakings as experiments whose purpose is as much to learn new information as it is to be ends in themselves. That’s why when I asked Musk what his thoughts were on negative feedback, he answered with this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I’m a huge believer in taking feedback. I’m trying to create a mental model that’s accurate, and if I have a wrong view on something, or if there’s a nuanced improvement that can be made, I’ll say, “I used to think this one thing that turned out to be wrong—now thank goodness I don’t have that wrong belief.”</em></p><p class=\"p1\">To a chef in the lab, negative feedback is a free boost forward in progress, courtesy of someone else. Pure upside.</p><p class=\"p1\">As for the F word…the word that makes our amygdalae quiver in the moonlight, the great chefs have something to say about that too:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. </em>—Henry Ford</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.</em> —Winston Churchill<a href=\"#footnote2-13-4367\" id=\"note2-13-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a><p class=\"p1\"><em>I have not failed 700 times. I’ve succeeded in proving 700 ways how not to build a lightbulb.</em> —Thomas Edison</p><p class=\"p1\">There’s no more reliable corollary than super-successful people thinking failure is fucking <em>awesome</em>.</p><p class=\"p1\">But there’s something to that. The science approach is all about learning through testing hypotheses, and hypotheses are built to be disproven, which means that scientists learn through failure. Failure is a critical part of their process.</p><p class=\"p1\">It makes sense. If there were two scientists trying to come up with a breakthrough in cancer treatment, and the first one is trying every bold thing he can imagine, failing left and right and learning something each time, while the second one is determined not to have any failures so is making sure his experiments are similar to others that have already been proven to work—which scientist would you bet on?</p><p class=\"p1\">It’s not surprising that so many of the most wildly impactful people seem to treat the world like a lab and their life like an experiment session—that’s the best way to succeed at something.</p><p class=\"p1\">But for most of us, we just can’t do it. Even poor Self-Loathing Cook, who is so damn close to being a chef—but somehow so far away.</p><p>So what’s stopping him? I think two major misconceptions:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Misconception 1: Misplaced Fear</strong></span></p><p>We talked about the chef’s courage actually just being an accurate assessment of risk—and that’s one of the major things Self-Loathing Cook is missing. He thinks he has become wise to the farce of letting dogma dictate your life, but he’s actually in the grasp of dogma’s slickest trick.</p><p>Humans are programmed to take fear <em>very </em>seriously, and evolution didn’t find it efficient to have us assess and re-assess every fear inside of us. It went instead with the “better safe than sorry” philosophy—i.e. if there’s a chance that a certain fear might be based on real danger, file it away as a real fear, just in case, and even if you confirm later that a fear of yours has no basis, keep it with you, just in case. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>And the fear file cabinet is somewhere <em>way </em>down in our psyches—somewhere far below our centers of rationality, out of reach.</p><p>The purpose of all of that fear is to make us protect ourselves from danger. The problem for us is that as far as evolution is concerned, danger = something that hurts the chance that your genes will move on—i.e., danger = not mating or dying or your kids dying, and that’s about it.</p><p>So in the same way our cook-like qualities were custom-built for survival in tribal times, our obsession with fears of all shapes and sizes may have served us well in Ethiopia 50,000 years ago—but it mostly ruins our lives today.</p><p>Because not only does it amp up our fear in general to “shit we botched the hunt now the babies are all going to starve to death this winter” levels even though we live in an “oh no I got laid off now I have to sleep at my parents’ house for two months with a feather pillow in ideal 68º temperature” world—but it also programs us to be terrified of all the wrong things. We’re more afraid of public speaking than texting on the highway, more afraid of approaching an attractive stranger in a bar than marrying the wrong person, more afraid of not being able to afford the same lifestyle as our friends than spending 50 years in meaningless career—all because embarrassment, rejection, and not fitting in really sucked for hunters and gatherers.</p><p>This leaves most of us with a skewed danger scale:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Danger-Scale.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4467 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Danger-Scale.png\" alt=\"Danger Scale\" width=\"501\" height=\"255\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Chefs hate real risk just as much as cooks—a chef that ends up in the Actually Dangerous territory and ends up in jail or in a gutter or in dire financial straits isn’t a chef—he’s a cook living under “I’m invincible” dogma. When we see chefs displaying what looks like incredible courage, they’re usually just in the Chef Lab. The Chef Lab is where all the action is and where the path to many people’s dreams lies—dreams about their career, about love, about adventure. But even though its doors are always open, most people never set foot in it for the same reason so many Americans never visit some of the world’s most interesting countries—because of an incorrect assumption that it’s a dangerous place. By reasoning by analogy when it comes to what constitutes danger and ending up with a misconception, Self-Loathing Cook is missing out on all the fun.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Misconception 2: Misplaced Identity</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">The second major problem for Self-Loathing Cook is that, like all cooks, he can’t wrap his head around the fact that he’s the scientist in the lab—not the experiment.</p><p class=\"p1\">As we established earlier, conscious tribe members reach conclusions, while blind tribe members <em>are </em>conclusions. And what you believe, what you stand for, and what you choose to do each day are conclusions that you’ve drawn. In some cases, very, very publicly.</p><p class=\"p1\">As far as society is concerned, when you give something a try—on the values front, the fashion front, the religious front, the career front—you’ve branded yourself. And since people like to simplify people in order to make sense of things in their own head, the tribe around you reinforces your brand by putting you in a clearly-labeled, oversimplified box.</p><p class=\"p1\">What this all amounts to is that it becomes very painful to <em>change</em>. Changing is <em>icky </em>for someone whose identity will have to change along with it. And others don’t make things any easier. Blind tribe members don’t like when other tribe members change—it confuses them, it forces them to readjust the info in their heads, and it threatens the simplicity of their tribal certainty. So attempts to evolve are often met with opposition or mockery or anger.</p><p class=\"p1\">And when you have a hard time changing, you become attached to who you currently are and what you’re currently doing—so attached that it blurs the distinction between the scientist and the experiment and you forget that they’re two different things.</p><p class=\"p1\">We talked about why scientists welcome negative feedback about their experiments. But when you <em>are</em> the experiment, negative feedback isn’t a piece of new, helpful information—it’s an <em>insult</em>. And it <em>hurts</em>. And it makes you <em>mad</em>.<em> </em>And because changing feels impossible, there’s not much good that feedback can do anyway—it’s like giving parents negative feedback on the name of their one-month-old child.</p><p class=\"p1\">We discussed why scientists expect plenty of their experiments to fail. But when you and the experiment are one and the same, not only is taking on a new goal a change of identity, it’s putting your identity on the <em>line</em>. If the experiment fails, <em>you</em><em> </em>fail. You <em>are</em><em> </em>a failure. Devastating. Forever.</p><p class=\"p1\">I talked to Musk about the United States and the way the forefathers reasoned by first principles when they started the country. He said he thought the reason they could do so is that they had a fresh slate to work with. The European countries of that era would have had a much harder time trying to do something like that—because, as he told me, they were “trapped in their own history.”</p><p class=\"p1\">I’ve heard Musk use this same phrase to describe the big auto and aerospace companies of today. He sees Tesla and SpaceX like the late 18th century USA—fresh new labs ready for experiments—but when he looks at other companies in their industries, he sees an inability to drive their strategies from a clean slate mentality. Referring to the aerospace industry, Musk said, <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“There’s a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering.” </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Being trapped in your history means you don’t know how to change, you’ve forgotten how to innovate, and you’re stuck in the identity box the world has put you in. And you end up being the cancer researcher we mentioned who only tries likely-to-succeed experimentation within the comfort zone he knows best. </span></p><p class=\"p1\">It’s for this reason that Steve Jobs looks back on his firing from Apple in 1986 as a blessing in disguise. He said:<a href=\"#footnote2-14-4367\" id=\"note2-14-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a> “Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.” Being fired “freed” Jobs from the shackles of his own history.</p><p class=\"p1\">So what Self-Loathing Cook has to ask himself is: “Am I trapped in my own history?” As he stands on the cliff with his wings ready for action and finds himself paralyzed—from evolving as a person, from making changes in his life, from trying to do something bold or unusual—is the baggage of his own identity part of what’s holding him back?</p><p class=\"p1\">Self-Loathing Cook’s beliefs about what’s scary aren’t any more real than Insecure Cook’s assumption that conventional wisdom has all the answers—but unlike the “Other people don’t know shit” epiphany, which you can observe evidence of all over the place, the epiphany that neither failing nor changing is actually a big deal can only be observed by experiencing it for yourself. Which you can only do after you overcome those fears…which only happens if you experience changing and failing and realize that nothing bad happens. Another catch-22.</p><p class=\"p1\">These are the reasons I believe so many of the world’s most able people are stuck in life as Self-Loathing Cook, one epiphany short of the promised land.</p><p class=\"p1\">The challenge with this last epiphany is to somehow figure out a way to lose respect for your own <em>fear</em>. That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by <em>defying </em>it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you’ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act. Doing something out of your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience, one that changes you—and each time you have that kind of experience, it chips away at your respect for your brain’s ingrained, irrational fears.</p><p class=\"p1\">Because the most important thing the chef knows that the cooks don’t is that real life and Grand Theft Auto aren’t actually that different. Grand Theft Auto is a fun video game because it’s a fake world where you can do things with no fear. Drive 200mph on the highway. Break into a building. Run over a prostitute with your car. All good in GTA.</p><p class=\"p1\">Unlike GTA, in real life, the law is a thing and jail is a thing. But that’s about where the differences end. If someone gave you a perfect simulation of today’s world to play in and told you that it’s all fake with no actual consequences—with the only rules being that you can’t break the law or harm anyone, and you still have to make sure to support your and your family’s basic needs—what would you do? My guess is that most people would do all kinds of things they’d love to do in their real life but wouldn’t dare to try, and that by behaving that way, they’d end up quickly getting a life going in the simulation that’s both far more successful and much truer to themselves than the real life they’re currently living. Removing the fear and the concern with identity or the opinions of others would thrust the person into the not-actually-risky Chef Lab and have them bouncing around all the exhilarating places outside their comfort zone—and their lives would take off. That’s the life irrational fears block us from.</p><p class=\"p1\">When I look at the amazing chefs of our time, what’s clear is that they’re more or less treating real life as if it’s Grand Theft Life. And doing so gives them superpowers. That’s what I think Steve Jobs meant all the times he said, “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”</p><p class=\"p1\">And that’s what this third epiphany is about: fearlessness.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\">So if we want to think like a scientist more often in life, those are the three key objectives—to be humbler about what we know, more confident about what’s possible, and less afraid of things that don’t matter.</p><p class=\"p1\">It’s a good plan—but also, ugh. Right? That’s a lot of stuff to try to do.</p><p class=\"p1\">Usually at the end of a post like this, the major point seems manageable and concrete, and I finish writing it all excited to go be good at shit. But this post was like, “Here’s everything important and go do it.” So how do we work with that?</p><p class=\"p1\">I think the key is to not try to be a perfect chef or expect that of yourself whatsoever. Because no one’s a perfect chef—not even Elon. And no one’s a pure cook either—nothing’s black and white when you’re talking about an animal species whose brains contain 86 billion neurons. The reality is that we’re all a little of both, and where we are on that spectrum varies in 100 ways, depending on the part of life in question, the stage we’re in of our evolution, and our mood that day.</p><p class=\"p1\">If we want to improve ourselves and move our way closer to the chef side of the spectrum, we have to remember to remember. We have to remember that we have software, not just hardware. We have to remember that reasoning is a skill and like any skill, you get better at it if you work on it. And we have to remember the cook/chef distinction, so we can notice when we’re being like one or the other.</p><p>It’s fitting that this blog is called Wait But Why because the whole thing is a little like the grown-up version of the Why? game. After emerging from the blur of the arrogance of my early twenties, I began to realize that my software was full of a lot of unfounded certainty and blind assumptions and that I needed to spend some serious time <em>deconstructing—</em>which is the reason that every Wait But Why post, no matter what the topic, tends to start off with the question, “What’s really going on here?”</p><p>For me, that question is the springboard into all of this remembering to remember—it’s a hammer that shatters a brittle, protective feeling of certainty and forces me to do the hard work of building a more authentic, more useful set of thoughts about something. Or at least a better-embraced bewilderment.</p><p>And when I started learning about Musk in preparation to write these posts, it hit me that he wasn’t just doing awesome things in the world—he was a master at looking at the world, asking “What’s really going on here?” and seeing the real answer. That’s why his story resonated so hard with me and why I dedicated so much Wait But Why time to this series.</p><p>But also, Mars.

A long series with long posts and a long time between posts. It turns out that when it comes to Musk and his shit, there was a lot to say.</p><p>Anyone who&#8217;s read the first three posts in this series is aware that I&#8217;ve not only been buried in the things Musk is doing, I&#8217;ve been drinking a tall glass of the Elon Musk Kool-Aid throughout. I&#8217;m very, very into it.</p><p>I kind of feel like that&#8217;s fine, right? The dude is a steel-bending industrial giant in America in a time when there aren&#8217;t supposed to be steel-bending industrial giants in America, igniting revolutions in huge, old industries that aren&#8217;t supposed to be revolutionable. After emerging from the 1990s dotcom party with $180 million, instead of sitting back in his investor chair listening to pitches from groveling young entrepreneurs, he decided to start a brawl with a <em>group </em>of 900-pound sumo wrestlers—the auto industry, the oil industry, the aerospace industry, the military-industrial complex, the energy utilities—and he might actually be <em>winning</em>. And all of this, it really seems, for the purpose of giving our species a better future.</p><p>Pretty Kool-Aid worthy. But someone being exceptionally rad isn&#8217;t Kool-Aid worthy enough to warrant 90,000 words over a string of months on a blog that&#8217;s supposed to be about a wide range of topics.</p><p>During the first post, I laid out the two objectives for the series:</p><p><strong>1) To understand why Musk is doing what he’s doing.</strong></p><p><strong>2) To understand why Musk is <em>able to </em>do what he’s doing. </strong></p><p>So far, we&#8217;ve spent most of the time exploring objective #1. But what <em>really</em> intrigued me as I began thinking about this was objective #2. I&#8217;m fascinated by those rare people in history who manage to dramatically change the world during their short time here, and I&#8217;ve always liked to study those people and read their biographies. Those people know something the rest of us don&#8217;t, and we can learn something valuable from them. Getting access to Elon Musk gave me what I decided was an unusual chance to get my hands on one of those people and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/examining-elon-musk-up-close.html\" target=\"_blank\">examine them up close</a>. If it were just Musk&#8217;s money or intelligence or ambition or good intentions that made him so capable, there would be more Elon Musks out there. No, it&#8217;s something else—what TED curator Chris Anderson called Musk&#8217;s &#8220;secret sauce&#8221;—and for me, this series became a mission to figure it out.</p><p>The good news is, after a <em>lot </em>of time thinking about this, reading about this, and talking to him and his staff, I think I&#8217;ve got it. What for a while was a large pile of facts, observations, and sound bites eventually began to congeal into a common theme—a trait in Musk that I believe he shares with many of the most dynamic icons in history and that separates him from almost everybody else.</p><p>As I worked through the Tesla and SpaceX posts, this concept kept surfacing, and it became clear to me that this series couldn&#8217;t end without a deep dive into exactly what it is that Musk and a few others do so unusually well. The thing that tantalized me is that this secret sauce is actually accessible to everyone and right there in front of us—if we can just wrap our heads around it. Mulling this all over has legitimately affected the way I think about my life, my future, and the choices I make—and I&#8217;m going to try my best in this post to explain why.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Two Kinds of Geology</strong></span></p><p>In 1681, English theologian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Burnet\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Burnet</a> published <i>Sacred Theory of the Earth, </i>in which he explained how geology worked. What happened was, around 6,000 years ago, the Earth was formed as a perfect sphere with a surface of idyllic land and a watery interior. But then, when the surface dried up a little later, cracks formed in its surface, releasing much of the water from within. The result was the Biblical Deluge and Noah having to deal with a ton of shit all week. Once things settled down, the Earth was no longer a perfect sphere—all the commotion had distorted the surface, bringing about mountains and valleys and caves down below, and the whole thing was littered with the fossils of the flood&#8217;s victims.</p><p>And bingo. Burnet had figured it out. The great puzzle of fundamental theology had been to reconcile the large number of seemingly-very-old Earth features with the much shorter timeline of the Earth detailed in the Bible. For theologians of the time, it was their version of the general relativity vs. quantum mechanics quandary, and Burnet had come up with a viable string theory to unify it all under one roof.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t just Burnet. There were enough theories kicking around reconciling geology with the verses of the Bible to today warrant a 15,000-word &#8220;Flood Geology&#8221; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_geology\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia page</a>.</p><p>Around the same time, another group of thinkers started working on the geology puzzle: scientists.</p><p>For the theologian puzzlers, the starting rules of the game were, &#8220;Fact: the Earth began 6,000 years ago and there was at one point an Earth-sweeping flood,&#8221; and their puzzling took place strictly within that context. But the scientists started the game with no rules at all. The puzzle was a blank slate where any observations and measurements they found were welcome.</p><p>Over the next 300 years, the scientists built theory upon theory, and as new technologies brought in new types of measurements, old theories were debunked and replaced with new updated versions. The science community kept surprising themselves as the apparent age of the Earth grew longer and longer. In 1907, there was a huge breakthrough when American scientist Bertram Boltwood pioneered the technique of deciphering the age of rocks through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating\" target=\"_blank\">radiometric dating</a>, which found elements in a rock with a known rate of radioactive decay and measured what portion of those elements remained intact and what portion had already converted to decay substance.</p><p>Radiometric dating blew Earth&#8217;s history backwards into the billions of years, which burst open new breakthroughs in science like the theory of Continental Drift, which in turn led to the theory of Plate Tectonics. The scientists were on a roll.</p><p>Meanwhile, the flood geologists would have none of it. To them, any conclusions from the science community were moot because they were breaking the rules of the game to begin with. The Earth was <em>officially</em> less than 6,000 years old, so if radiometric dating showed otherwise, it was a flawed technique, period.</p><p>But the scientific evidence grew increasingly compelling, and as time wore on, more and more flood geologists threw in the towel and accepted the scientist&#8217;s viewpoint—maybe they had had the rules of the game wrong.</p><p>Some, though, held strong. The rules were the rules, and it didn&#8217;t matter how many people agreed that the Earth was billions of years old—it was a grand conspiracy.</p><p>Today, there are <a href=\"https://www.probe.org/the-grand-canyon-and-the-age-of-the-earth/\" target=\"_blank\">still</a> <a href=\"http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/usnews/060907a.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> flood geologists making their case. Just recently, an author named Tom Vail wrote a book called <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Grand-Canyon-A-Different-View/dp/0890513732\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Canyon: A Different View</a></em>, in which he explains:</p><p><em>Contrary to what is widely believed, radioactive dating has not proven the rocks of the Grand Canyon to be millions of years old. The vast majority of the sedimentary layers in the Grand Canyon were deposited as the result of a global flood that occurred after and as a result of the initial sin that took place in the Garden of Eden.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>If the website analytics stats on <a href=\"https://chartbeat.com\" target=\"_blank\">Chartbeat</a> included a &#8220;Type of Geologist&#8221; demographic metric, I imagine that for Wait But Why readers, the breakdown would look something like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geology-Breakdown.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4415 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geology-Breakdown.jpg\" alt=\"Geology Breakdown\" width=\"401\" height=\"277\" /></a></p><p>It makes sense. Whether religious or not, most people who read this site are big on data, evidence, and accuracy. I&#8217;m reminded of this every time I make an error in a post.</p><p>Whatever role faith plays in the spiritual realm, what most of us agree on is that when seeking answers to our questions about the age of the Earth, the history of our species, the causes of lightning, or any other physical phenomenon in the universe, data and logic are far more effective tools than faith and scripture.</p><p>And yet—after thinking about this for a while, I&#8217;ve come to an unpleasant conclusion:</p><p><strong>When it comes to most of the way we think, the way we make decisions, and the way we live our lives, we&#8217;re much more like the flood geologists than the science geologists.</strong></p><p>And Elon&#8217;s secret? He&#8217;s a scientist through and through.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Hardware and Software</strong></span></p><p>The first clue to the way Musk thinks is in the super odd way that he talks. For example:</p><p><strong>Human child: </strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared of the dark, because that&#8217;s when all the scary shit is gonna get me and I won&#8217;t be able to see it coming.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>&#8220;When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it&#8217;s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn&#8217;t afraid of the dark anymore after that.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-2-4367\" id=\"note2-2-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>Or:</p><p><strong>Human father: </strong>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to start working less because my kids are starting to grow up.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>“I’m trying to throttle back, because particularly the triplets are starting to gain consciousness. They’re almost two.”<a href=\"#footnote2-3-4367\" id=\"note2-3-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p>Or:</p><p><strong>Human single man: </strong>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to find a girlfriend. I don&#8217;t want to be so busy with work that I have no time for dating.&#8221;</p><p><b>Elon: </b>&#8220;I would like to allocate more time to dating, though. I need to find a girlfriend. That’s why I need to carve out just a little more time. I think maybe even another five to 10 — how much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours? That’s kind of the minimum? I don’t know.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-4367\" id=\"note2-4-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p>I call this MuskSpeak. MuskSpeak is a language that describes everyday parts of life as exactly what they actually, literally are.</p><p>There are plenty of instances of technical situations when we all agree that MuskSpeak makes much more sense than normal human parlance—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heart-Surgery1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4441 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heart-Surgery1.jpg\" alt=\"Heart Surgery\" width=\"533\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><p>—but what makes Musk odd is that he thinks about <em>most </em>things in MuskSpeak, including many areas where you don&#8217;t usually find it. Like when I asked him if he was afraid of death, and he said having kids made him more comfortable with dying, because &#8220;kids sort of are a bit you. At least they’re half you. They’re half you at the hardware level, and depending on how much time you have with them, they’re that percentage of you at the software level.&#8221;</p><p>When you or I look at kids, we see small, dumb, cute people. When Musk looks at his five kids, he sees five of his favorite computers. When he looks at you, he sees a computer. And when he looks in the mirror, he sees a computer—<em>his </em>computer. It&#8217;s not that Musk suggests that people are <em>just </em>computers—it&#8217;s that he sees people as computers on top of whatever else they are.</p><p>And at the most literal level, Elon&#8217;s right about people being computers. At its simplest definition, a computer is an object that can store and process data—which the brain certainly is.</p><p>And while this isn&#8217;t the most poetic way to think about our minds, I&#8217;m starting to believe that it&#8217;s one of those areas of life where MuskSpeak can serve us well—because thinking of a brain as a computer forces us to consider the distinction between our hardware and our software, a distinction we often fail to recognize.</p><p>For a computer, hardware is defined as &#8220;the machines, wiring, and other physical components of a computer.&#8221; So for a human, that&#8217;s the physical brain they were born with and all of its capabilities, which determines their raw intelligence, their innate talents, and other natural strengths and shortcomings.</p><p>A computer&#8217;s software is defined as &#8220;the programs and other operating information used by a computer.&#8221; For a human, that&#8217;s what they know and how they think—their belief systems, thought patterns, and reasoning methods. Life is a flood of incoming data of all kinds that enter the brain through our senses, and it&#8217;s the software that assesses and filters all that input, processes and organizes it, and ultimately uses it to generate the key output—a decision.</p><p>The hardware is a ball of clay that&#8217;s handed to us when we&#8217;re born. And of course, not all clay is equal—each brain begins as a unique combination of strengths and weaknesses across a wide range of processes and capabilities.</p><p>But it&#8217;s the software that determines what kind of tool the clay gets shaped into.</p><p>When people think about what makes someone like Elon Musk so effective, they often focus on the hardware—and Musk&#8217;s hardware has some pretty impressive specs. But the more I learn about Musk and other people who seem to have superhuman powers—whether it be Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, Genghis Khan, Marie Curie, John Lennon, Ayn Rand,<a href=\"#footnote-2-4367\" id=\"note-2-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> or Louis C.K.—the more I&#8217;m convinced that it&#8217;s their software, not their natural-born intelligence or talents, that makes them so rare and so effective.</p><p>So let&#8217;s talk about software—starting with Musk&#8217;s. As I wrote the other three posts in this series, I looked at everything I was learning about Musk—the things he says, the decisions he makes, the missions he takes on and how he approaches them—as clues to how his underlying software works.</p><p>Eventually, the clues piled up and the shape of the software began to reveal itself. Here&#8217;s what I think it looks like:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Elon&#8217;s Software</strong></span></p><p>The structure of Musk&#8217;s software starts like many of ours, with what we&#8217;ll call the Want box:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Box.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4402 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Box.png\" alt=\"Software - Want Box\" width=\"252\" height=\"267\" /></a></p><p>This box contains anything in life where you want Situation A to turn into Situation B. Situation A is currently what&#8217;s happening and you want something to change so that Situation B is what&#8217;s happening instead. Some examples:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wants.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4442 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wants.jpg\" alt=\"Wants\" width=\"600\" height=\"317\" /></a></p><p>Next, the Want box has a partner in crime—what we&#8217;ll call the Reality box. It contains all things that are possible:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Box.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4399 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Box.png\" alt=\"Software - Reality Box\" width=\"303\" height=\"246\" /></a></p><p>Pretty straightforward.</p><p>The overlap of the Want and Reality boxes is the Goal Pool, where your goal options live:<a href=\"#footnote-3-4367\" id=\"note-3-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Goal-Pool1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4434 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Goal-Pool1.png\" alt=\"Software - Goal Pool\" width=\"443\" height=\"212\" /></a></p><p>So you pick a goal from the pool—the thing you&#8217;re going to try to move from Point A to Point B.</p><p>And how do you cause something to change? You direct your power towards it. A person&#8217;s power can come in various forms: your time, your energy (mental and physical), your resources, your persuasive ability, your connection to others, etc.</p><p>The concept of employment is just Person A using their resources power (a paycheck) to direct Person B&#8217;s time and/or energy power toward Person A&#8217;s goal. When Oprah publicly recommends a book, that&#8217;s combining her abundant power of connection (she has a huge reach) and her abundant power of persuasion (people trust her) and directing them towards the goal of getting the book into the hands of thousands of people who would have otherwise never known about it.</p><p>Once a goal has been selected, you know the <em>direction</em> in which to point your power. Now it&#8217;s time to figure out the most effective way to use that power to generate the outcome you want—that&#8217;s your strategy:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Box.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4437 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Box.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Strategy Box\" width=\"421\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><p>Simple right? And probably not that different from how you think.</p><p>But what makes Musk&#8217;s software so effective isn&#8217;t its structure, it&#8217;s that he uses it like a scientist. Carl Sagan said, &#8220;Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge,&#8221; and you can see Musk apply that way of thinking in two key ways:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) He builds each software component himself, from the ground up. </strong></span></p><p>Musk calls this &#8220;reasoning from first principles.&#8221; I&#8217;ll let him explain:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I think generally people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good.” But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-5-4367\" id=\"note2-5-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p class=\"p1\">In science, this means starting with what evidence shows us to be true. A scientist doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Well we know the Earth is flat because that&#8217;s the way it looks, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s intuitive, and that&#8217;s what everyone agrees is true,&#8221; a scientist says, &#8220;The part of the Earth that I can see at any given time appears to be flat, which would be the case when looking at a small piece of many differently shaped objects up close, so I don&#8217;t have enough information to know what the shape of the Earth is. One reasonable hypothesis is that the Earth is flat, but until we have tools and techniques that can be used to prove or disprove that hypothesis, it is an open question.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">A scientist gathers together only what he or she knows to be true—the first principles—and uses those as the puzzle pieces with which to construct a conclusion.</p><p class=\"p1\">Reasoning from first principles is a hard thing to do in life, and Musk is a master at it. Brain software has four major decision-making centers:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>1) Filling in the Want box</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>2) Filling in the Reality box</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><b>3) Goal selection from the Goal Pool</b></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>4) Strategy formation</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">Musk works through each of these boxes by reasoning from first principles. Filling in the Want box from first principles requires a deep, honest, and independent understanding of yourself. Filling in the Reality box requires the clearest possible picture of the actual facts of both the world and your own abilities. The Goal Pool should double as a Goal Selection Laboratory that contains tools for intelligently measuring and weighing options. And strategies should be formed based on what you know, not on what is typically done.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) He continually adjusts each component&#8217;s conclusions as new information comes in.</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">You might remember doing proofs in geometry class, one of the most mundane parts of everyone&#8217;s childhood. These ones:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given:</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given:</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore:</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">Math is satisfyingly exact. Its givens are exact and its conclusions are airtight.</p><p class=\"p1\">In math, we call givens &#8220;axioms,&#8221; and axioms are 100% true. So when we build conclusions out of axioms, we call them &#8220;proofs,&#8221; which are also 100% true.</p><p class=\"p1\">Science doesn&#8217;t have axioms or proofs, for good reason.</p><p class=\"p1\">We could have called Newton&#8217;s law of universal gravitation a proof—and for a long time, it certainly seemed like one—but then what happens when Einstein comes around and shows that Newton was actually &#8220;zoomed in,&#8221; like someone calling the Earth flat, and when you zoom <em>way </em>out, you discover that the <em>real </em>law is general relativity and Newton&#8217;s law actually stops working under extreme conditions, while general relativity works no matter what. So then, you&#8217;d call general relativity a proof instead. Except then what happens when quantum mechanics comes around and shows that general relativity fails to apply on a tiny scale and that a new set of laws is needed to account for those cases.</p><p class=\"p1\">There are no axioms or proofs in science because nothing is for sure and everything we feel sure about might be disproven. Richard Feynman has said, &#8220;Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty—some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely certain.&#8221; Instead of proofs, science has <em>theories</em>. Theories are based on hard evidence and treated as truths, but at all times they&#8217;re susceptible to being adjusted or disproven as new data emerges.</p><p class=\"p1\">So in science, it&#8217;s more like:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (for now):</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given (for now):</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore (for now):</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">In our lives, the only true axiom is &#8220;I exist.&#8221; Beyond that, nothing is for sure. And for most things in life, we can&#8217;t even build a real scientific theory because life doesn&#8217;t tend to have exact measurements.</p><p class=\"p1\">Usually, the best we can do is a strong hunch based on what data we have. And in science, a hunch is called a hypothesis. Which works like this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (it seems, based on what I know):</strong> A = B<br /><strong>Given (<strong>it seems, based on what I know</strong>):</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore (<strong>it seems, based on what I know</strong>):</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">Hypotheses are built to be tested. Testing a hypothesis can disprove it or strengthen it, and if it passes enough tests, it can be upgraded to a theory.</p><p class=\"p1\">So after Musk builds his conclusions from first principles, what does he do? He tests the shit out of them, continually, and adjusts them regularly based on what he learns. Let&#8217;s go through the whole process to show how:</p><p class=\"p1\">You begin by reasoning from first principles to A) fill in the Want box, B) fill in the Reality box, C) select a goal from the pool, and D) build a strategy—and then you get to work. You&#8217;ve used first principles thinking to decide where to point your power and the most effective way to use it.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the goal-achievement strategy you came up with was just your first crack. It was a hypothesis, ripe for testing. You test a strategy hypothesis one way: action. You pour your power into the strategy and see what happens. As you do this, data starts flowing in—results, feedback, and new information from the outside world. Certain parts of your strategy hypothesis might be strengthened by this new data, others might be weakened, and new ideas may have sprung to life in your head through the experience—but either way, some adjustment is usually called for:<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Loop.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4401 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Strategy-Loop.png\" alt=\"Software - Strategy Loop\" width=\"345\" height=\"469\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">As this strategy loop spins and your power becomes more and more effective at accomplishing your goal, other things are happening down below.</p><p class=\"p1\">For someone reasoning from first principles, the Want box at any given time is a snapshot of their innermost desires the last time they thought hard about it. But the contents of the Want box are also a hypothesis, and experience can show you that you were wrong about something you thought you wanted or that you want something you didn&#8217;t realize you did. At the same time, the inner you isn&#8217;t a statue—it&#8217;s a shifting, morphing sculpture whose innermost values change as time passes. So even if something in the Want box was correct at one point, as <em>you</em> change, it may lose its place in the box. The Want box should serve the current inner you as best possible, which requires you to update it, something you do through reflection:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4438 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Want-Loop1.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Want Loop\" width=\"453\" height=\"505\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">A rotating Want loop is called evolution.</p><p class=\"p1\">On the other side of the aisle, the Reality box is also going through a process. &#8220;Things that are possible&#8221; is a hypothesis, maybe more so than anything else. It takes into account both the state of the world and your own abilities. And as your own abilities change and grow, the world changes even faster. What was possible in the world in 2005 is <em>very</em> different from what&#8217;s possible today, and it&#8217;s a huge (and rare) advantage to be working with an up-to-date Reality box.</p><p class=\"p1\">Filling in your Reality box from first principles is a great challenge, and keeping the box current so that it matches actual reality takes continual work.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Loop.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4428 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Reality-Loop.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Reality Loop\" width=\"482\" height=\"482\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">For each of these areas, the box represents the current hypothesis and the circle represents the source of new information that can be used to adjust the hypothesis. It&#8217;s our duty to remember that the circles are the boss, not the boxes—the boxes are only trying their best to do the circles proud. And if we fall out of touch with what&#8217;s happening in the circles, the info in the boxes becomes obsolete and a less effective source for our decision-making.</p><p class=\"p1\">Thinking about the software as a whole, let&#8217;s take a step back. What we see is a goal formation mechanism below and a goal attainment mechanism above. One thing goal attainment often requires is laser focus. To get the results we want, we zoom in on the micro picture, sinking our teeth into our goal and honing in on it with our strategy loop.</p><p class=\"p1\">But as time passes, the Want box and Reality box adjust contents and morph shape, and eventually, something else can happen—the Goal Pool changes.</p><p class=\"p1\">The Goal Pool is just the overlap of the Want and Reality boxes, so its own shape and contents are totally dependent on the state of those boxes. And as you live your life inside the goal attainment mechanism above, it&#8217;s important to make sure that what you&#8217;re working so hard on remains in line with the Goal Pool below—so let&#8217;s add in two big red arrows for that:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Full.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4427 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Software-Full.jpg\" alt=\"Software - Full\" width=\"567\" height=\"498\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Checking in with the large circle down below requires us to lift our heads up from the micro mission and do some macro reflection. And when enough changes happen in the Want and Reality boxes that the goal you&#8217;re pursuing is no longer in the goal pool, it calls for a macro life change—a breakup, a job switch, a relocation, a priority swap, an attitude shift.</p><p class=\"p1\">All together, the software I&#8217;ve described is a living, breathing system, constructed on a rock solid foundation of first principles, and built to be nimble, to keep itself honest, and to change shape as needed to best serve its owner.</p><p class=\"p1\">And if you read about Elon Musk&#8217;s life, you can watch this software in action.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How Musk&#8217;s software wrote his life story</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Getting started</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Step 1 for Elon was filling in the contents of the Want box. Doing this from first principles is a huge challenge—you have to dig deep into concepts like right and wrong, good and bad, important and trivial, valuable and frivolous. You have to figure out what you respect, what you disdain, what fascinates you, what bores you, and what excites you deep in your inner child. Of course, there&#8217;s no way for anyone of any age to have a clear cut answer to these questions, but Elon did the best thing he could by ignoring others and independently pondering.</p><p class=\"p1\">I talked with him about his early thought process in figuring out what to do with his career. He has said many times that he cares deeply about the future well-being of the human species—something that is clearly in the center of his Want box. I asked how he came to that, and he explained:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The thing that I care about is—when I look into the future, I see the future as a series of branching probability streams. So you have to ask, what are we doing to move down the good stream—the one that’s likely to make for a good future? Because otherwise, you look ahead, and it’s like “Oh it’s dark.” If you’re projecting to the future, and you’re saying “Wow, we’re gonna end up in some terrible situation,” that’s depressing.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Fair. Honing in on his specific path, I brought up the great modern physicists like Einstein and Hawking and Feynman, and I asked him whether he considered going into scientific discovery instead of engineering. His response:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I certainly admire the discoveries of the great scientists. They’re discovering what already exists—it’s a deeper understanding of how the universe already works. That’s cool—but the universe already sort of knows that. What matters is knowledge in a human context. What I’m trying to ensure is that knowledge in a human context is still possible in the future. So it’s sort of like—I’m more like the gardener, and then there are the flowers. If there’s no garden, there’s no flowers. I could try to be a flower in the garden, or I could try to make sure there is a garden. So I’m trying to make sure there is a garden, such that in the future, many Feynmans may bloom.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, both A and B are good, but without A there is no B. So I choose A.</p><p class=\"p1\">He went on:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I was at one point thinking about doing physics as a career—I did undergrad in physics—but in order to really advance physics these days, you need the data. Physics is fundamentally governed by the progress of engineering. This debate—“Which is better, engineers or scientists? Aren’t scientists better? Wasn’t Einstein the smartest person?”—personally, I think that engineering is better because in the absence of the engineering, you do not have the data. You just hit a limit. And yeah, you can be real smart within the context of the limit of the data you have, but unless you have a way to get more data, you can’t make progress. Like look at Galileo. He engineered the telescope—that’s what allowed him to see that Jupiter had moons. The limiting factor, if you will, is the engineering. And if you want to advance civilization, you must address the limiting factor. Therefore, you must address the engineering.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">A and B are both good, but B can only advance if A advances. So I choose A.</p><p class=\"p1\">In thinking about where exactly to point himself to best help humanity, Musk says that in college, he thought hard about the first principles question, “What will most affect the future of humanity?” and put together a list of five things: “the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.”<a href=\"#footnote2-6-4367\" id=\"note2-6-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><p class=\"p1\">Hearing him talk about what matters to him, you can see up and down the whole stack of Want box reasoning that led him to his current endeavors.</p><p class=\"p1\">He has other reasons too. Next to wanting to help humanity in the Want box is this quote:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I&#8217;m interested in things that change the world or affect future in wondrous new technology where you see it and you’re like, “How did that even happen? How is that possible?”</em><a href=\"#footnote2-7-4367\" id=\"note2-7-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p class=\"p1\">This follows a theme of Musk being passionate about super-advanced technology and the excitement it brings to him and other people. So given all of the above, an ideal endeavor for Musk would be something involving engineering, something in an area that will be important for the future, and something to do with cutting-edge technology. Those broad, basic Want box items alone narrow down the goal pool considerably.</p><p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, he was a teenager with no money, reputation, or connections, and limited knowledge and skills. In other words, his Reality box wasn&#8217;t that big. So he did what many young people do—he focused his early goals not around achieving his Wants, but expanding the Reality box and its list of &#8220;things that are possible.&#8221; He wanted to be able to legally stay in the US after college, and he also wanted to gain more knowledge about engineering, so he killed two birds with one stone and applied to a PhD program at Stanford to study high energy density capacitors, a technology aimed at coming up with a more efficient way than traditional batteries to store energy.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>U-turn to the internet</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Musk had gone into the Goal Pool and picked the Stanford program, and he moved to California to get started. But there was one thing—it was 1995. The internet was in the early stages of taking off and moving much faster than people had anticipated. It was also a world Musk could dive into without money or a reputation. So he added a bunch of internet-related possibilities into his Reality box. The early internet was also more <em>exciting </em>than he had anticipated—so getting involved in it quickly found its way into his Want box.</p><p class=\"p1\">These rapid adjustments caused big changes in his Goal Pool, to the point where the Stanford PhD was no longer what his software&#8217;s goal formation center was outputting.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most people would have stuck with the Stanford program—because they had already told everyone about it and it would be weird to quit, because it was Stanford, because it was a more normal path, because it was safer, because the internet might be a fad, because what if he were 35 one day and was a failure with no money because he couldn&#8217;t get a good job without the right degree.</p><p class=\"p1\">Musk quit the program after two days. The big macro arrow of his software came down on the right, saw that what he was embarking on wasn&#8217;t in the Goal Pool anymore, and he trusted his software—so he made a macro change.</p><p class=\"p1\">He started Zip2 with his brother, an early cross between the concepts of the Yellow Pages and Google Maps. Four years later, they sold the company and Elon walked away with $22 million.</p><p class=\"p1\">As a dotcom millionaire, the conventional wisdom was to settle down as a lifelong rich guy and either invest in other companies or start something new with other people&#8217;s money. But Musk&#8217;s goal formation center had other ideas. His Want box was bursting with ambitious startup ideas that he thought could have major impact on the world, and his Reality box, which now included $22 million, told him that he had a high chance of succeeding. Being leisurely on the sidelines was nowhere in his Want box and totally unnecessary according to his Reality box.</p><p class=\"p1\">So he used his newfound wealth to start X.com in 1999, with the vision to build a full-service online financial institution. The internet was still young and the concept of storing your money in an online bank was totally inconceivable to most people, and Musk was advised by many that it was a crazy plan. But again, Musk trusted his software. What he knew about the internet told him that this was inside the Reality box—because his reasoning told him that when it came to the internet, the Reality box had grown <em>much </em>bigger than people appreciated—and that was all he needed to know to move forward. In the top part of his software, as his strategy-action-results-adjustments loop spun, X.com&#8217;s service changed, the team changed, the mission changed, even the name changed. By the time eBay bought it in 2002, the company was called PayPal and it was a money transfer service. Musk made $180 million.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Following his software to space</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Now 31 years old and fabulously wealthy, Musk had to figure out what to do next with his life. On top of the &#8220;whatever you do, definitely don&#8217;t risk losing that money you have&#8221; conventional wisdom, there was also the common logic that said, &#8220;You&#8217;re awesome at building internet companies, but that&#8217;s all you know since you&#8217;ve never done anything else. You&#8217;re in your thirties now and it&#8217;s too late to do something big in a whole different field. This is the path you chose—you&#8217;re an internet guy.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">But Musk went back to first principles. He looked inwards to his Want box, and having reflected on things, doing another internet thing wasn&#8217;t really in the box anymore. What was in there was his still-burning desire to help the future of humanity. In particular, he felt that to have a long future, the species would have to become much better at space travel.</p><p class=\"p1\">So he started exploring the limits of the Reality box when it came to getting involved in the aerospace industry.</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom screamed at the top of its lungs for him to stop. It said he had no formal education in the field and didn&#8217;t know the first thing about being a rocket scientist. But his software told him that formal education was just another way to download information into your brain and &#8220;a painfully slow download&#8221; at that—so he started reading, meeting people, and asking questions.</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom said no entrepreneur had ever succeeded at an endeavor like this before, and that he shouldn&#8217;t risk his money on something so likely to fail. But Musk&#8217;s stated philosophy is, &#8220;When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">Conventional wisdom said that he couldn&#8217;t afford to build rockets because they were too expensive and pointed to the fact that no one had ever made a rocket that cheaply before—but like the scientists who ignored those who said the Earth was 6,000 years old and those who insisted the Earth was flat, Musk started crunching numbers to do the math himself. Here&#8217;s how he recounts his thoughts:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Historically, all rockets have been expensive, so therefore, in the future, all rockets will be expensive. But actually that&#8217;s not true. If you say, what is a rocket made of? It&#8217;s made of aluminum, titanium, copper, carbon fiber. And you can break it down and say, what is the raw material cost of all these components? And if you have them stacked on the floor and could wave a magic wand so that the cost of rearranging the atoms was zero, then what would the cost of the rocket be? And I was like, wow, okay, it&#8217;s really small—it&#8217;s like 2% of what a rocket costs. So clearly it would be in how the atoms are arranged—so you&#8217;ve got to figure out how can we get the atoms in the right shape much more efficiently. And so I had a series of meetings on Saturdays with people, some of whom were still working at the big aerospace companies, just to try to figure out if there&#8217;s some catch here that I&#8217;m not appreciating. And I couldn&#8217;t figure it out. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any catch. So I started SpaceX.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-8-4367\" id=\"note2-8-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p class=\"p1\">History, conventional wisdom, and his friends all said one thing, but his own software, reasoning upwards from first principles, said another—and he trusted his software. He started <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a>, again with his own money, and dove in head first. The mission: dramatically lower the cost of space travel to make it possible for humanity to become multi-planetary.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Tesla and beyond</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Two years later, while running a growing SpaceX, a friend brought Elon to a company called AC Propulsion, which had created a prototype for a super-fast, long-range electric car. It blew him away. The Reality box of Musk&#8217;s software had told him that such a thing wasn&#8217;t yet possible, but it turns out that Musk wasn&#8217;t aware of how far lithium-ion batteries had advanced, and what he saw at AC Propulsion was new information about the world that put &#8220;starting a top-notch electric car company&#8221; into the Reality box in his head.</p><p class=\"p1\">He ran into the same conventional wisdom about battery costs as he had about rocket costs. Batteries had never been made cheaply enough to allow for a mass-market, long-range electric car because the cost of making a battery was simply too high. He used the same first principles logic and a calculator to determine that most of the problem was the cost of middlemen, not raw materials, and decided that actually, conventional wisdom was wrong and batteries could be much cheaper in the future. So he co-founded <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> with the mission of accelerating the advent of a mostly-electric-vehicle world—first by pouring in resources power and funding the company, and later by contributing his time and energy resources as well and becoming CEO.</p><p class=\"p1\">Two years after that, Musk co-founded <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html\" target=\"_blank\">SolarCity</a> with his cousins, a company whose goal was to revolutionize energy production by creating a large, distributed utility that would install solar panel systems on millions of homes. Musk knew that his time/energy power, the one kind of power that has hard limits, no matter who you are, was mostly used up, but he still had plenty of resources power—so he put it to work on another goal in his Goal Pool.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most recently, Musk has jumpstarted change in another area that&#8217;s important to him—the way people transport themselves from city to city. His idea is that there should be an entirely new mode of transport that will whiz people hundreds of miles by zinging them through a tube. He calls it the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop</a>. For this project, he&#8217;s not using his time, energy, or resources. Instead, by laying out his initial thoughts in a <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/hyperloop_alpha.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> and hosting a <a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/hyperloop\" target=\"_blank\">competition</a> for engineers to test out their innovations, he&#8217;s leveraging his powers of connection and persuasion to create change.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\">There are all kinds of tech companies that build software. They think hard, for years, about the best, most efficient way to make their product. Musk sees people as computers, and he sees his brain software as the most important product he owns—and since there aren&#8217;t companies out there designing brain software, he designed his own, beta tests it every day, and makes constant updates. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s so outrageously effective, why he can disrupt <em>multiple </em>huge industries at once, why he can learn so quickly, strategize so cleverly, and visualize the future so clearly.</p><p class=\"p1\">This part of what Musk does isn&#8217;t rocket science—it&#8217;s common sense. Your entire life runs on the software in your head—why <em>wouldn&#8217;t </em>you obsess over optimizing it?</p><p class=\"p1\">And yet, not only do most of us not obsess over our own software—most of us don&#8217;t even <em>understand</em> our own software, how it works, or why it works that way. Let&#8217;s try to figure out why.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Most People&#8217;s Software</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">You always hear facts about human development and how so much of who you become is determined by your experiences during your formative years. A newborn&#8217;s brain is a malleable ball of hardware clay, and its job upon being born is to quickly learn about whatever environment it&#8217;s been born into and start shaping itself into the optimal tool for survival in those circumstances. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so easy for young children to learn new skills.</p><p class=\"p1\">As people age, the clay begins to harden and it becomes more difficult to change the way the brain operates. My grandmother has been using a computer as long as I have, but I use mine comfortably and easily because my malleable childhood brain easily wrapped itself around basic computer skills, while she has the same face on when she uses her computer that my tortoise does when I put him on top of a glass table and he thinks he&#8217;s inexplicably hovering two feet above the ground. She&#8217;ll use a computer when she needs to, but it&#8217;s not her friend.</p><p class=\"p1\">So when it comes to our brain software—our values, perceptions, belief systems, reasoning techniques—what are we learning during those key early years?</p><p class=\"p1\">Everyone&#8217;s raised differently, but for most people I know, it went something like this:</p><p class=\"p1\">We were taught all kinds of things by our parents and teachers—what&#8217;s right and wrong, what&#8217;s safe and dangerous, the kind of person you should and shouldn&#8217;t be. But the idea was: I&#8217;m an adult so I know much more about this than you, it&#8217;s not up for debate, don&#8217;t argue, just obey. That&#8217;s when the cliché &#8220;Why?&#8221; game comes in (what ElonSpeak calls &#8220;the chained why&#8221;).</p><p class=\"p1\">A child&#8217;s instinct isn&#8217;t just to know what to do and not to do, she wants to <em>understand </em>the rules of her environment. And to understand something, you have to have a sense of how that thing was built. When parents and teachers tell a kid to do XYZ and to simply obey, it&#8217;s like installing a piece of already-designed software in the kid&#8217;s head. When kids ask Why? and then Why? and then Why?, they&#8217;re trying to deconstruct that software to see how it was built—to get down to the first principles underneath so they can weigh how much they should actually care about what the adults seem so insistent upon.</p><p class=\"p1\">The first few times a kid plays the Why game, parents think it&#8217;s cute. But many parents, and most teachers, soon come up with a way to cut the game off:</p><p class=\"p1\">Because I said so.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Because I said so&#8221; inserts a concrete floor into the child&#8217;s deconstruction effort below which no further Why&#8217;s may pass. It says, &#8220;You want first principles? There. There&#8217;s your floor. No more Why&#8217;s necessary.

They have to do all the shit they used to have to do, except now on top of that there are these self-obsessed, drippy little creatures they have to upkeep, who think parents exist to serve them. On a busy day, in a bad mood, with 80 things to do, the Why game is a nightmare.</p><p class=\"p1\">But it might be a nightmare worth enduring. A command or a lesson or a word of wisdom that comes without any insight into the steps of logic it was built upon is feeding a kid a fish instead of teaching them to reason. And when that&#8217;s the way we&#8217;re brought up, we end up with a bucket of fish and no rod—a piece of installed software that we&#8217;ve learned how to use, but no ability to code anything ourselves.</p><p class=\"p1\">School makes things worse. One of my favorite thinkers, writer Seth Godin (whose <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> is bursting with first principles reasoning wisdom), explains in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXpbONjV1Jc\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a> about school that the current education system is a product of the Industrial Age, a time that catapulted productivity and the standard of living. But along with many more factories came the need for many more factory workers, so our education system was redesigned around that goal. He explains:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>The deal was: universal public education whose sole intent was not to train the scholars of tomorrow—we had plenty of scholars. It was to train people to be willing to work in the factory. It was to train people to behave, to comply, to fit in. &#8220;We process you for a whole year. If you are defective, we hold you back and process you again. We sit you in straight rows, just like they organize things in the factory. We build a system all about interchangeable people because factories are based on interchangeable parts.&#8221;</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Couple that concept with what another favorite writer of mine, James Clear, explained recently on his <a href=\"http://jamesclear.com/creative-thinking\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>In the 1960s, a creative performance researcher named George Land conducted a study of 1,600 five-year-olds and 98 percent of the children scored in the “highly creative” range. Dr. Land re-tested each subject during five year increments. When the same children were 10-years-old, only 30 percent scored in the highly creative range. This number dropped to 12 percent by age 15 and just 2 percent by age 25. As the children grew into adults they effectively had the creativity trained out of them. In the words of Dr. Land, “non-creative behavior is learned.&#8221;</em></p><p class=\"p1\">It makes sense, right? Creative thinking is a close cousin of first principles reasoning. In both cases, the thinker needs to <em>invent</em> his own thought pathways. People think of creativity as a natural born talent, but it&#8217;s actually much more of a <em>way of thinking</em>—it&#8217;s the thinking version of painting onto a blank canvas. But to do that requires brain software that&#8217;s skilled and practiced at coming up with new things, and school trains us on the exact opposite concept—to follow the leader, single-file, and to get really good at taking tests. Instead of a blank canvas, school hands kids a coloring book and tells them to stay within the lines.<a href=\"#footnote-4-4367\" id=\"note-4-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p class=\"p1\">What this all amounts to is that during our brain&#8217;s most malleable years, parents, teachers, and society end up putting our clay in a mold and squeezing it tightly into a preset shape.</p><p class=\"p1\">And when we grow up, without having learned how to build our own style of reasoning and having gone through the early soul-searching that independent thinking requires, we end up needing to rely on whatever software was installed in us for everything—software that, coming from parents and teachers, was probably itself designed 30 years ago.</p><p class=\"p1\">30 years, if we&#8217;re lucky. Let&#8217;s think about this for a second.</p><p class=\"p1\">Just say you have an overbearing mother who insists you grow up with her values, her worldview, her fears, and her ambitions—because she knows best, because it&#8217;s a scary world out there, because XYZ is respectable, because she said so.</p><p class=\"p1\">Your head might end up running your whole life on &#8220;because mom says so&#8221; software. If you play the Why? game with something like the reason you&#8217;re in your current job, it may take a few Why&#8217;s to get there, but you&#8217;ll most likely end up hitting a concrete floor that says some version of &#8220;because mom says so.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">But why does mom say so?</p><p class=\"p1\">Mom says so because <em>her</em> mom said so—after growing up in Poland in 1932, where she was from a home where <em>her</em> dad said so because <em>his </em>dad—a minister from a small town outside Krakow—said so after his grandfather, who saw some terrible shit go down during the Siberian Uprising of 1866, ingrained in his children&#8217;s heads the critical life lesson to never associate with blacksmiths.</p><p class=\"p1\">Through a long game of telephone, your mother now looks down upon office jobs and you find yourself feeling strongly about the only truly respectable career being in publishing. And you can list off a bunch of reasons why you feel that way—but if someone <em>really </em>grilled you on your reasons and on the reasoning beneath them, you end up in a confusing place. It gets confusing way down there because the first principles foundation at the bottom is a mishmash of the values and beliefs of a bunch of people from different generations and countries—a bunch of people who aren&#8217;t you.</p><p class=\"p1\">A common example of this in today&#8217;s world is that many people I know were raised by people who were raised by people who went through the Great Depression. If you solicit career advice from someone born in the US in the 1920s, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll get an answer pumped out by this software:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grandma-Software.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4460 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grandma-Software.jpg\" alt=\"Grandma Software\" width=\"359\" height=\"584\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The person has lived a long life and has made it all the way to 2015, but their software was coded during the Great Depression, and if they&#8217;re not the type to regularly self-reflect and evolve, they still do their thinking with software from 1930. And if they installed that same software in their children&#8217;s heads and their children then passed it on to their own children, a member of Generation Y today might feel too scared to pursue an entrepreneurial or artistic endeavor and be totally unaware that they&#8217;re actually being haunted by the ghost of the Great Depression.</p><p class=\"p1\">When old software is installed on new computers, people end up with a set of values not necessarily based on their own deep thinking, a set of beliefs about the world not necessarily based on the reality of the world they live in, and a bunch of opinions they might have a hard time defending with an honest heart.</p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, a whole lot of convictions not really based on actual data. We have a word for that.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Dogma</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with people: they don&#8217;t learn by understanding, they learn by some other way—by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!</em> —Richard Feynman</p><p class=\"p1\">Dogma is everywhere and comes in a thousand different varieties—but the format is generally the same:</p><p class=\"p1\">X is true because [authority] says so. The authority can be many things.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Because-I-said-so-21.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4519\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Because-I-said-so-21.jpg\" alt=\"Because I said so 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"1867\" /></a></p><p>Dogma, unlike first principles reasoning, isn&#8217;t customized to the believer or her environment and isn&#8217;t meant to be critiqued and adjusted as things change. It&#8217;s not software to be coded—it&#8217;s a printed rulebook. Its rules may be originally based on reasoning by a certain kind of thinker in a certain set of circumstances, at a time far in the past or a place far away, or it may be based on no reasoning at all. But that doesn&#8217;t matter because you&#8217;re not supposed to dig too deep under the surface anyway—you&#8217;re just supposed to accept it, embrace it, and live by it. No evidence needed.</p><p class=\"p1\">You may not like living by someone else&#8217;s dogma, but you&#8217;re left without much choice. When your childhood attempts at understanding are met with &#8220;Because I said so,&#8221; and you absorb the implicit message &#8220;Your own reasoning capability is shit, don&#8217;t even try, just follow these rules so you don&#8217;t fuck your life up,&#8221; you grow up with little confidence in your own reasoning process. When you&#8217;re never forced to build your own reasoning pathways, you&#8217;re able to skip the hard process of digging deep to discover your own values and the sometimes painful experience of testing those values in the real world and learning you want to adjust them—and so you grow up a total reasoning amateur.</p><p class=\"p1\">Only strong reasoning skills can carve a unique life path, and without them, dogma will quickly have you living someone else&#8217;s life. Dogma doesn&#8217;t know you or care about you and is often completely wrong for you—it&#8217;ll have a would-be happy painter spending their life as a lawyer and a would-be happy lawyer spending their life as a painter.</p><p class=\"p1\">But when you don&#8217;t know how to reason, you don&#8217;t know how to evolve or adapt. If the dogma you grew up with isn&#8217;t working for you, you can reject it, but as a reasoning amateur, going it alone usually ends with you finding another dogma lifeboat to jump onto—another rulebook to follow and another authority to obey. You don&#8217;t know how to code your own software, so you install someone else&#8217;s.</p><p class=\"p1\">People don&#8217;t do any of this intentionally—usually if we reject a type of dogma, our intention is to break free of a life of dogmatic thinking altogether and brave the cold winds of independent reasoning. But dogmatic thinking is a hard habit to break, especially when it&#8217;s all you know. I have a friend who just had a baby, and she told me that she was so much more open-minded than her parents, because they wanted her to have a prestigious career, but she&#8217;d be open to her daughter doing anything. After a minute, she thought about it, and said, &#8220;Well actually, no, what I mean by that is if she wanted to go do something like spend her life on a farm in Montana, I&#8217;d be fine with that and my parents never would have been—but if she said she wanted to go work at a hedge fund, I&#8217;d kill her.&#8221; She realized mid-sentence that she wasn&#8217;t free of the rigid dogmatic thinking of her parents, she had just changed dogma brands.</p><p>This is the dogma trap, and it&#8217;s hard to escape from. Especially since dogma has a powerful ally—the group.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong> Tribes</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I’m very suspicious. It doesn’t make sense to me that you’d have the same solution to every issue.</em> —Louis C.K.</p><p class=\"p1\">What most dogmatic thinking tends to boil down to is another good Seth Godin <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/07/people-like-us-do-stuff-like-this.html\" target=\"_blank\">phrase</a>:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>People like us do stuff like this.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s the rallying cry of tribalism.</p><p class=\"p1\">There&#8217;s an important distinction to make here. Tribalism tends to have a negative connotation, but the concept of a tribe itself isn&#8217;t bad. A tribe is just a group of people linked together by something they have in common—a religion, an ethnicity, a nationality, family, a philosophy, a cause. Christianity is a tribe. The US Democratic Party is a tribe. Australians are a tribe. Radiohead fans are a tribe. Arsenal fans are a tribe. The musical theater scene in New York is a tribe. Temple University is a tribe. And within large, loose tribes, there are smaller, tighter, sub-tribes. Your extended family is a tribe, of which your immediate family is a sub-tribe. Americans are a tribe, of which Texans are a sub-tribe, of which Evangelical Christians in Amarillo, Texas is a sub-sub-tribe.</p><p class=\"p1\">What makes tribalism a good or bad thing depends on the tribe member and their relationship with the tribe. In particular, one simple distinction:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tribalism is good when the tribe and the tribe member both have an independent identity and they <em>happen </em>to be the same. </strong>The tribe member has chosen to be a part of the tribe because it happens to match who he really is. If either the identity of the tribe or the member evolves to the point where the two no longer match, the person will leave the tribe. Let&#8217;s call this <strong>conscious tribalism.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Tribalism is bad when the tribe and tribe member&#8217;s identity are one and the same. </strong>The tribe member&#8217;s identity is determined by whatever the tribe&#8217;s dogma happens to say. If the identity of the tribe changes, the identity of the tribe member changes with it in lockstep. The tribe member&#8217;s identity can&#8217;t change independent of the tribal identity because the member has no independent identity. Let&#8217;s call this <strong>blind tribalism.</strong></p><p class=\"p1\">With conscious tribalism, the tribe member and his identity comes <em>first</em>. The tribe member&#8217;s identity is the alpha dog, and <em>who he is determines the tribes he&#8217;s in.</em> With blind tribalism, the tribe comes first. The tribe is the alpha dog and <em>it&#8217;s the tribe that determines who he is.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">This isn&#8217;t black and white—it&#8217;s a spectrum—but when someone is raised without strong reasoning skills, they may also lack a strong independent identity and end up vulnerable to the blind tribalism side of things—especially with the various tribes they were born into. That&#8217;s what Einstein was getting at when he said, &#8220;Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">A large tribe like a religion or nation or political party will contain members who fall across the whole range of the blind-to-conscious spectrum. But some tribes themselves will be the type to attract a certain type of follower. It makes logical sense that the more rigid and certain and <em>dogmatic</em> the tribe, the more likely it&#8217;ll be to attract blind tribe members. ISIS is going to have a far higher percentage of blind tribe members than the London Philosophy Club.</p><p class=\"p1\">The allure of dogmatic tribes makes sense—they appeal to very core parts of human nature.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans crave connection and camaraderie, and a guiding dogma is a common glue to bond together a group of unique individuals as one.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans want internal security, and for someone who grows up feeling shaky about their own distinctive character, a tribe and its guiding dogma is a critical lifeline—a one-stop shop for a full suite of human opinions and values.</p><p class=\"p1\">Humans also long for the comfort and safety of certainty, and nowhere is conviction more present than in the groupthink of blind tribalism. While a scientist&#8217;s data-based opinions are only as strong as the evidence she has and inherently subject to change, tribal dogmatism is an exercise in faith, and with no data to be beholden to, blind tribe members believe what they believe with certainty.</p><p class=\"p1\">We discussed why math has proofs, science has theories, and in life, we should probably limit ourselves to hypotheses—but blind tribalism proceeds with the confidence of the mathematician:</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong>Given (because the tribe says so): </strong>A = B<br /><strong>Given <strong>(because the tribe says so)</strong>:</strong> B = C + D<br /><strong>Therefore, with certainty:</strong> A = C + D</p><p class=\"p1\">And since so many others in the tribe feel certain about things, your own certainty is reassured and reinforced.</p><p>But there&#8217;s a heavy cost to these comforts. Insecurity can be solved the hard way or the easy way—and by giving people the easy option, dogmatic tribes remove the pressure to do the hard work of evolving into a more independent person with a more internally-defined identity. In that way, dogmatic tribes are an <i>enabler</i> of the blind tribe member&#8217;s deficiencies.</p><p class=\"p1\">The sneaky thing about both rigid tribal dogma and blind membership is that they like to masquerade as open-minded thought with conscious membership. I think many of us may be closer to the blind membership side of things with certain tribes we&#8217;re a part of than we recognize—and those tribes we&#8217;re a part of may not be as open-minded as we tend to think.</p><p>A good test for this is the intensity of the <em>us </em>factor. That key word in &#8220;People like us do stuff like this&#8221; can get you into trouble pretty quickly.</p><p>Us feels great. A major part of the appeal of being in a tribe is that you get to be part of an Us, something humans are wired to seek out. And a loose Us is nice—like the Us among conscious, independent tribe members.</p><p>But the Us in blind tribalism is creepy. In blind tribalism, the tribe&#8217;s guiding dogma doubles as the identity of the tribe members, and the Us factor enforces that concept. Conscious tribe members reach conclusions—blind tribe members <em>are</em> conclusions. With a blind Us, if the way you are as an individual happens to contain opinions, traits, or principles that fall outside the outer edges of the dogma walls, they will need to be shed—or things will get ugly. By challenging the dogma of your tribe, you&#8217;re challenging both the sense of certainty the tribe members gain their strength from and the clear lines of identity they rely on.</p><p>The best friend of a blind Us is a nemesis Us—<em>Them</em>. Nothing unites Us like a collectively hated anti-Us, and the blind tribe is usually defined almost as much by hating the dogma of Them as it is by abiding by the dogma of Us.</p><p>Whatever element of rigid, identity-encompassing blindness is present in your own tribal life will reveal itself when you dare to validate any part of the rival Them dogma.</p><p>Give it a try. The next time you&#8217;re with a member of a tribe you&#8217;re a part of, express a change of heart that aligns you on a certain topic with whoever your tribe considers to be Them. If you&#8217;re a religious Christian, tell people at church you&#8217;re not sure anymore that there&#8217;s a God. If you&#8217;re an artist in Boulder, explain at the next dinner party that you think global warming might actually be a liberal hoax. If you&#8217;re an Iraqi, tell your family that you&#8217;re feeling pro-Israel lately. If you and your husband are staunch Republicans, tell him you&#8217;re coming around on Obamacare. If you&#8217;re from Boston, tell your friends you&#8217;re pulling for the Yankees this year because you like their current group of players.</p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re in a tribe with a blind mentality of total certainty, you&#8217;ll probably see a look of horror. It won&#8217;t just seem wrong, it&#8217;ll seem like <em>heresy</em>. They might get angry, they might passionately try to convince you otherwise, they might cut off the conversation—but there will be no open-minded conversation. And because identity is so intertwined with beliefs in blind tribalism, the person actually might feel less close to you afterwards. Because for rigidly tribal people, a shared dogma plays a more important role in their close relationships than they might recognize.</p><p class=\"p1\">Most of the major divides in our world emerge from blind tribalism, and on the extreme end of the spectrum—where people are complete <em>sheep</em>—blind tribalism can lead to terrifying things. Like those times in history when a few charismatic bad guys can build a large army of loyal foot soldiers just by displaying strength and passion. Because blind tribalism is the true villain behind our grandest-scale atrocities:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Equations1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4444 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Equations1.png\" alt=\"Equations\" width=\"597\" height=\"175\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Most of us probably wouldn&#8217;t have joined the Nazi party, because most of us aren&#8217;t on the extreme end of the blind-to-conscious spectrum. But I don&#8217;t think many of us are on the <em>other</em> end either. Instead, we&#8217;re usually somewhere in the hazy middle—in the land of cooks.<a href=\"#footnote-5-4367\" id=\"note-5-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>The Cook and the Chef</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">The difference between the way Elon thinks and the way most people think is kind of like the difference between a cook and a chef.</p><p class=\"p1\">The words &#8220;cook&#8221; and &#8220;chef&#8221; seem kind of like synonyms. And in the real world, they&#8217;re often used interchangeably. But in this post, when I say chef, I don&#8217;t mean any ordinary chef. I mean the <em>trailblazing chef—</em>the kind of chef who <em>invents</em> recipes. And for our purposes, everyone else who enters a kitchen—all those who <em>follow</em> recipes—is a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">Everything you eat—every part of every cuisine we know so well—was at some point in the past created for the <em>first time</em>. Wheat, tomatoes, salt, and milk go back a long time, but at some point, <em>someone</em> said, &#8220;What if I take those ingredients and do this&#8230;and this&#8230;..and this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; and ended up with the world&#8217;s first pizza. That&#8217;s the work of a chef.</p><p class=\"p1\">Since then, god knows how many people have made a pizza. That&#8217;s the work of a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">The chef reasons from first principles, and for the chef, the first principles are raw edible ingredients. Those are her puzzle pieces, her building blocks, and she works her way upwards from there, using her experience, her instincts, and her taste buds.</p><p class=\"p1\">The cook works off of some version of what&#8217;s already out there—a recipe of some kind, a meal she tried and liked, a dish she watched someone else make.</p><p class=\"p1\">Cooks span a wide range. On one end, you have cooks who only cook by following a recipe to the T<em>—</em>carefully measuring every ingredient exactly the way the recipe dictates. The result is a delicious meal that tastes exactly the way the recipe has it designed. Down the range a bit, you have more of a confident cook—someone with experience who gets the general gist of the recipe and then uses her skills and instincts to do it her own way. The result is something a little more unique to her style that tastes like the recipe but not quite. At the far end of the cook range, you have an innovator who makes her own concoctions. A lamb burger with a vegetable bun, a peanut butter and jelly pizza, a cinnamon pumpkin seed cake.<a href=\"#footnote-6-4367\" id=\"note-6-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p class=\"p1\">But what all of these cooks have in common is their starting point is something that already exists. Even the innovative cook is still making an iteration of a burger, a pizza, and a cake.</p><p class=\"p1\">At the very end of the spectrum, you have the chef. A chef might make good food or terrible food, but whatever she makes, it&#8217;s a result of her own reasoning process, from the selection of raw ingredients at the bottom to the finished dish at the top.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Spectrum2.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4456 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Spectrum2.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Spectrum\" width=\"598\" height=\"219\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">In the culinary world, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a cook. Most people are cooks because for most people, inventing recipes isn&#8217;t a goal of theirs.</p><p class=\"p1\">But in life—when it comes to the reasoning &#8220;recipes&#8221; we use to churn out a decision—we may want to think twice about where we are on the cook-chef spectrum.</p><p class=\"p1\">On a typical day, a &#8220;reasoning cook&#8221; and a &#8220;reasoning chef&#8221; don&#8217;t operate that differently. Even the chef becomes quickly exhausted by the mental energy required for first principles reasoning, and usually, doing so isn&#8217;t worth his time. Both types of people spend an average day with their brain software running on auto-pilot and their conscious decision-making centers dormant.</p><p class=\"p1\">But then comes a day when something new needs to be figured out. Maybe the cook and the chef are each given the new task at work to create a better marketing strategy. Or maybe they&#8217;re unhappy with that job and want to think of what business to start. Maybe they have a crush on someone they never expected to have feelings for and they need to figure out what to do about it.</p><p class=\"p1\">Whatever this new situation is, auto-pilot won&#8217;t suffice—this is something new and neither the chef&#8217;s nor the cook&#8217;s software has done this before. Which leaves only two options:</p><p class=\"p1\">Create. Or copy.</p><p class=\"p1\">The chef says, &#8220;Ugh okay, here we go,&#8221; rolls up his sleeves, and does what he always does in these situations—he switches on the active decision-making part of his software and starts to go to work. He looks at what data he has and seeks out what more he needs. He thinks about the current state of the world and reflects on where his values and priorities lie. He gathers together those relevant first principles ingredients and starts puzzling together a reasoning pathway. It takes some hard work, but eventually, the pathway brings him to a hypothesis. He knows it&#8217;s probably wrong-ish, and as new data emerges, he&#8217;ll &#8220;taste-test&#8221; the hypothesis and adjust it. He keeps the decision-making center on standby for the next few weeks as he makes a bunch of early adjustments to the flawed hypothesis—a little more salt, a little less sugar, one prime ingredient that needs to be swapped out for another. Eventually, he&#8217;s satisfied enough with how things are going to move back into auto-pilot mode. This new decision is now part of the automated routine—a new recipe is in the cookbook—and he&#8217;ll check in on it to make adjustments every once in a while or as new pertinent data comes in, the way he does for all parts of his software.</p><p class=\"p1\">The cook has no idea what&#8217;s going on in the last paragraph. The reasoning cook&#8217;s software is called &#8220;Because the recipe said so,&#8221; and it&#8217;s more of a computerized catalog of recipes than a computer program. When the cook needs to make a life decision, he goes through his collection of authority-written recipes, finds the one he trusts in that particular walk of life, and reads through the steps to see what to do—kind of like WWJD, except the J is replaced by whatever authority is most trusted in that area. For most questions, the authority is the tribe, since the cook&#8217;s tribal dogma covers most standard decisions. But in this particular case, the cook leafed through the tribe&#8217;s cookbook and couldn&#8217;t find any section about this type of decision. So he needs to get a hold of a recipe from another authority he trusts with this type of thing. Once the cook finds the right recipe, he can put it in his catalog and use it for all future decisions on this matter.</p><p class=\"p1\">First, the cook tries a few friends. His catalog doesn&#8217;t have the needed info, but maybe one of theirs does. He asks them for their advice—not so he can use it as additional thinking to supplement his own, but so it can <em>become </em>his own thinking.</p><p class=\"p1\">If that doesn&#8217;t yield any strongly-opinionated results, he&#8217;ll go to the trusty eternal backstop—conventional wisdom.</p><p class=\"p1\">Society as a whole is its own loose tribe, often spanning your whole nation or even your whole part of the world, and what we call &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; is its guiding dogma cookbook—online and available to the public. Typically, the larger the tribe, the more general and more outdated the dogma—and the conventional wisdom database runs like a DMV website last updated in 1992. But when the cook has nowhere else to turn, it&#8217;s like a trusty old friend.</p><p class=\"p1\">And in this case—let&#8217;s say the cook is thinking of starting a business and wants to know what the possibilities are—conventional wisdom has him covered. He types the command into the interface, waits a few minutes, and then the system pumps out its answer:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CWDOS1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4447 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CWDOS1.png\" alt=\"CWDOS\" width=\"562\" height=\"403\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The cook, thoroughly discouraged, thanks the machine and updates his Reality box accordingly.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cook-reality-box-simple.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4445 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Cook-reality-box-simple.png\" alt=\"Cook reality box simple\" width=\"282\" height=\"249\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">With the decision made (not to start a business), he switches his software back into auto-pilot mode. Done and done.</p><p class=\"p1\">Musk calls the cook&#8217;s way of thinking &#8220;reasoning by analogy&#8221; (as opposed to reasoning by first principles), which is a nice euphemism. The next time a kid gets caught copying answers from another student&#8217;s exam during the test, he should just explain that he was reasoning by analogy.</p><p class=\"p1\">If you start looking for it, you&#8217;ll see the chef/cook thing happening everywhere. There are chefs and cooks in the worlds of music, art, technology, architecture,<a href=\"#footnote-7-4367\" id=\"note-7-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> writing, business, comedy, marketing, app development, football coaching, teaching, and military strategy. And in each case, though both parties are usually just on autopilot, mindlessly playing the latest album again and again at concerts, it&#8217;s in those key moments when it&#8217;s time to <em>write </em>a new album—those moments of truth in front of a clean canvas, a blank Word doc, an empty playbook, a new sheet of blueprint paper, a fresh whiteboard—that the chef and the cook reveal their true colors. The chef creates while the cook, in some form or another, copies.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Line-of-cooks.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4395 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Line-of-cooks.png\" alt=\"Line of cooks\" width=\"515\" height=\"355\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">And the difference in outcome is enormous. For cooks, even the more innovative kind, there&#8217;s almost always a ceiling on the size of the splash they can make in the world, unless there&#8217;s some serious luck involved. Chefs aren&#8217;t guaranteed to do anything good, but when there&#8217;s a little talent and a lot of persistence, they&#8217;re almost certain<em> </em>to make a splash. Sometimes the chef is the one brave enough to go for something big—but other times, someone doesn&#8217;t feel the desire to make a splash and the chef is the one with the strength of character to step out of the game and in favor of keeping it small. Being a chef isn&#8217;t being like Elon Musk—it&#8217;s being yourself.</p><p class=\"p1\">No one talks about the &#8220;reasoning industry,&#8221; but we&#8217;re all part of it, and when it comes to chefs and cooks, it&#8217;s no different than any other industry. We&#8217;re working in the reasoning industry every time we make a decision.</p><p class=\"p1\">Your current life, with all its facets and complexity, is like a reasoning industry album. The question is, how did that set of songs come to be? How were the songs composed, and by whom? And in those critical do-or-die moments when it&#8217;s time to write a new song, how do you do your creating? Do you dig deep into yourself? Do you start with the drumbeat and chords of an existing song and write your own melody on top of it? Do you just play covers?</p><p class=\"p1\">I know what you <em>want </em>the answers to these questions to be. This is a straightforward one—it&#8217;s clearly better to be a chef. But unlike the case with most major distinctions in life—hard-working vs. lazy, ethical vs. dishonest, considerate vs. selfish—when the chef/cook distinction passes right in front of us, we often don&#8217;t even notice it&#8217;s there.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Missing the Distinction</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">Like the culinary world&#8217;s cook-to-chef range, the real world&#8217;s cook-to-chef range isn&#8217;t binary—it lies on a spectrum:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4529\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum3.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Life Spectrum\" width=\"600\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">But I&#8217;m pretty sure that when most of us look at that spectrum, we <em>think </em>we&#8217;re farther to the right than we actually are. We&#8217;re usually more cook-like than we realize—we just can&#8217;t see it from where we&#8217;re standing.</p><p class=\"p1\">For example—</p><p class=\"p1\">Cooks are followers—by definition. They&#8217;re a cook because in whatever they&#8217;re doing, they&#8217;re following some kind of recipe. But most of us don&#8217;t think of ourselves as followers.</p><p class=\"p1\">A follower, we think, is a weakling with no mind of their own. We think about leadership positions we&#8217;ve held and initiatives we&#8217;ve taken at work and the way we never let friends boss us around, and we take these as evidence that we&#8217;re no follower. Which in turn means that we&#8217;re not just a cook.</p><p class=\"p1\">But the problem is—the only thing all of that proves is that you&#8217;re no follower <em>within your tribe</em>. As Einstein meanly put it:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">In other words, you might be a star and a leader in your world or in the eyes of your part of society, but if the core reason you picked that goal in the first place was because your tribe&#8217;s cookbook says that it&#8217;s an impressive thing and it makes the other tribe members gawk, <em>you&#8217;re not being a leader—you&#8217;re being a super-successful follower. </em>And, as Einstein says, no less of a cook than all those whom you&#8217;ve impressed.</p><p class=\"p1\">To see the truth, you need to zoom way out until you can see the real leader of the cooks—the cookbook.</p><p>But we don&#8217;t tend to zoom out, and when we look around at our life, zoomed in, what appears to be a highly unique and independent self may be an optical illusion.<a href=\"#footnote-8-4367\" id=\"note-8-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> What often feels like independent reasoning when zoomed out is actually playing connect-the-dots on a pre-printed set of steps laid out by someone else. What feels like personal principles might just be the general tenets of your tribe. What feels like original opinions may have actually been spoon-fed to us by the media or our parents or friends or our religion or a celebrity. What feels like Roark might actually be Keating. What feels like our chosen life path could just be one of a handful of pre-set, tribe-approved yellow brick roads. What feels like creativity might be filling in a coloring book—and making sure to stay inside the lines.</p><p>Because of this optical illusion, we&#8217;re unable to see the flaws in our own thinking or recognize an unusually great thinker when we see one. Instead, when a superbly science-minded, independent-thinking chef like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein comes around, what do we attribute their success to?</p><p>Awesome fucking hardware.</p><p>When we look at Musk, we see someone with genius, with vision, with superhuman balls. All things, we assume, he was more or less born with. So to us, the spectrum looks more like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum-Skewed1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4455 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chef-Cook-Life-Spectrum-Skewed1.png\" alt=\"Chef-Cook Life Spectrum Skewed\" width=\"598\" height=\"219\" /></a></p><p>The way we see it, we&#8217;re all a bunch of independent-thinking chefs—and it&#8217;s just that Musk is a really impressive chef.</p><p>Which is both A) overrating Musk and B) overrating ourselves. And <em>completely</em> missing the real story.</p><p>Musk is an impressive chef for sure, but what makes him such an extreme standout isn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s impressive—<em>it&#8217;s that most of us aren&#8217;t chefs at all.</em></p><p>It&#8217;s like a bunch of typewriters looking at a computer and saying, &#8220;Man, that is one talented typewriter.&#8221;</p><p>The reason we have such a hard time seeing what&#8217;s really going on is that we don&#8217;t get that brain software is even a <em>thing</em>. We don&#8217;t think of brains as computers, so we don&#8217;t think about the distinction between hardware and software at all. When we think about the brain, we think only about the hardware—the thing we&#8217;re born with and are powerless to change or improve. Much less tangible to us is the concept of how we reason. We see reasoning as a thing that just kind of <em>happens</em>, like our bodies&#8217; blood flow—it&#8217;s a process that automatically happens, and there&#8217;s not much else to say or do about it.</p><p>And if we can&#8217;t even see the hardware/software distinction, we certainly can&#8217;t see the more nuanced chef software vs. cook software distinction.</p><p>By not seeing our thinking software for what it is—a <em>critical </em>life skill, something that can be learned, practiced, and improved, and the major factor that separates the people who do great things from those who don&#8217;t—we fail to realize where the game of life is really being played. We don&#8217;t recognize reasoning as a thing that can be created or copied—and in the same way that causes us to mistake our own cook-like behavior for independent reasoning, we then mistake the actual independent reasoning of the chef for exceptional and magical abilities.</p><p>Three examples:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) We mistake the chef&#8217;s clear view of the present for vision into the future.</strong></span></p><p>Musk&#8217;s sister Tosca said &#8220;Elon has already gone to the future and come back to tell us what he&#8217;s found.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-9-4367\" id=\"note2-9-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> This is how a lot of people feel about Musk—that he&#8217;s a visionary, that he can somehow see things we cannot. We see it like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4458 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-1.jpg\" alt=\"Musk Visionary 1\" width=\"519\" height=\"266\" /></a></p><p>But actually, it&#8217;s like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4459 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Musk-Visionary-2.jpg\" alt=\"Musk Visionary 2\" width=\"516\" height=\"291\" /></a></p><p>Conventional wisdom is slow to move, and there&#8217;s significant lag time between when something becomes reality and when conventional wisdom is revised to reflect that reality. And by the time it does, reality has moved on to something else. But chefs don&#8217;t pay attention to that, reasoning instead using their eyes and ears and experience. By ignoring conventional wisdom in favor of simply looking at the present for what it really is and staying up-to-date with the facts of the world as they change in real-time—in spite of what conventional wisdom has to say—the chef can act on information the rest of us haven&#8217;t been given permission to act on yet.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) We mistake the chef&#8217;s accurate understanding of risk for courage.</strong></span></p><p>Remember this ElonSpeak quote from earlier?</p><p><em>When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength—400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it&#8217;s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn&#8217;t afraid of the dark anymore after that.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-10-4367\" id=\"note2-10-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p>That&#8217;s just a kid chef assessing the actual facts of a situation and deciding that his fear was misplaced.</p><p>As an adult, Musk said this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Sometimes people fear starting a company too much. Really, what’s the worst that could go wrong? You’re not gonna starve to death, you&#8217;re not gonna die of exposure—what’s the worst that could go wrong?</em><a href=\"#footnote2-11-4367\" id=\"note2-11-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p>Same quote, right?</p><p>In both cases, Musk is essentially saying, &#8220;People consider X to be scary, but their fear is not based on logic, so I&#8217;m not scared of X.&#8221; That&#8217;s not courage—that&#8217;s logic.</p><p>Courage means doing something risky. Risk means exposing yourself to danger. We intuitively understand this—that&#8217;s why most of us wouldn&#8217;t call child Elon <em>courageous </em>for sleeping with the lights off. Courage would be a weird word to use there because no actual danger was involved.</p><p>All Elon&#8217;s saying in the second quote is that being scared to start a company is the adult version of being scared of the dark. It&#8217;s not actually dangerous.</p><p>So when Musk put his entire fortune down and on SpaceX and Tesla, he was being bold as fuck, but courageous? Not the right word. It was a case of a chef taking a bunch of information he had and puzzling together a plan that seemed logical. It&#8217;s not that he was sure he&#8217;d succeed—in fact, he thought SpaceX in particular had a reasonable probability of failure—it&#8217;s just that nowhere in his assessments did he foresee <em>danger</em>.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3) We mistake the chef&#8217;s originality for brilliant ingenuity. </strong></span></p><p>People believe thinking outside the box takes intelligence and creativity, but it&#8217;s mostly about independence. When you simply ignore the box and build your reasoning from scratch, whether you&#8217;re brilliant or not, you end up with a unique conclusion—one that may or may not fall within the box.</p><p>When you&#8217;re in a foreign country and you decide to ditch the guidebook and start wandering aimlessly and talking to people, unique things always end up happening. When people hear about those things, they think of you as a pro traveler and a bold adventurer—when all you really did is ditch the guidebook.</p><p>Likewise, when an artist or scientist or businessperson chef reasons independently instead of by analogy, and their puzzling happens to both A) turn out well and B) end up outside the box, people call it innovation and marvel at the chef&#8217;s ingenuity. When it turns out <em>really </em>well, all the cooks do what they do best—copy—and now it&#8217;s called a revolution.</p><p>Simply by refraining from reasoning by analogy, the chef opens up the possibility of making a huge splash with every project. When Steve Jobs<a href=\"#footnote-9-4367\" id=\"note-9-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> and Apple turned their attention to phones, they didn&#8217;t start by saying, &#8220;Okay well people seem to like this kind of keyboard more than that kind, and everyone seems unhappy with the difficulty of hitting the numbers on their keyboards—so let&#8217;s get creative and make the best phone keyboard yet!&#8221; They simply asked, &#8220;What should a mobile device be?&#8221; and in their from-scratch reasoning, a physical keyboard didn&#8217;t end up as part of the plan at all. It didn&#8217;t take genius to come up with the design of the iPhone—it&#8217;s actually pretty logical—it just took the ability to not copy.</p><p>Different version of the same story with the invention of the United States. When the American forefathers found themselves with a new country on their hands, they didn&#8217;t ask, &#8220;What should the rules be for selecting our king, and what should the limitations of his power be?&#8221; A king to them was what a physical keyboard was to Apple. Instead, they asked, &#8220;What should a country be and what&#8217;s the best way to govern a group of people?&#8221; and by the time they had finished their puzzling, a king wasn&#8217;t part of the picture—their first principles reasoning led them to believe that John Locke had a better plan and they worked their way up from there.</p><p>History is full of the stories of chefs creating revolutions of apparent ingenuity through simple first principles reasoning. Genghis Khan organizing a smattering of tribes that had been fragmented for centuries using a <a href=\"http://www.alanculler.com/Genghis%20Khan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">powers of ten system</a> in order to build one grand tribe that could sweep the world. Henry Ford creating cars with the out-of-the-box manufacturing technique of assembly-line production in order to bring cars to the masses for the first time. Marie Curie using unconventional methods to pioneer the theory of radioactivity and topple the &#8220;atoms are indivisible&#8221; assumption on its head (she won a Nobel Prize in both physics and chemistry—two prizes reserved exclusively for chefs). Martin Luther King taking a nonviolent Thoreau approach to a situation normally addressed by riots. Larry Page and Sergey Brin ignoring the commonly-used methods of searching the internet in favor of what they saw as a more logical system that based page importance on the number of important sites that linked to it. The 1966 Beatles deciding to stop being the world&#8217;s best cooks, ditching the typical songwriting styles of early-60s bands, including their own, and become music chefs, creating a bunch of new types of songs from scratch that no one had heard before.</p><p>Whatever the time, place, or industry, anytime something <em>really </em>big happens, there&#8217;s almost always an experimenting chef at the center of it—not being anything magical, just trusting their brain and working from scratch. Our world, like our cuisines, was created by these people—the rest of us are just along for the ride.</p><p>Yeah, Musk is smart as fuck and insanely ambitious—but that&#8217;s not why he&#8217;s beating everybody. What makes Musk so rad is that he&#8217;s a software outlier. A chef in a world of cooks. A science geologist in a world of flood geologists. A brain software pro in a world where people don&#8217;t realize brain software is a thing.</p><p>That&#8217;s Elon Musk&#8217;s secret sauce.</p><p>Which is why the real story here isn&#8217;t Musk. It&#8217;s us.</p><p>The real puzzle in this series isn&#8217;t why Elon Musk is trying to end the era of gas cars or why he&#8217;s trying to land a rocket or why he cares so much about colonizing Mars—it&#8217;s why Elon Musk is so <em>rare</em>.</p><p>The curious thing about the car industry isn&#8217;t why Tesla is focusing so hard on electric cars, and the curious thing about the aerospace industry isn&#8217;t why SpaceX is trying so hard to make rockets reusable—the fascinating question is why they&#8217;re the only companies doing so.</p><p>We spent this whole time trying to figure out the mysterious workings of the mind of a madman genius only to realize that Musk&#8217;s secret sauce is that he&#8217;s the only one being normal. And in isolation, Musk would be a pretty boring subject—it&#8217;s the backdrop of <em>us</em> that makes him interesting. And it&#8217;s that backdrop that this series is really about.</p><p>So&#8230;what&#8217;s the deal with us? How did we end up so scared and cook-like? And how do we learn to be more like the chefs of the world, who seem to so effortlessly carve their own way through life? I think it comes down to three things.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>How to Be a Chef</strong></span></p><p>Anytime there&#8217;s a curious phenomenon within humanity—some collective insanity we&#8217;re all suffering from—it usually ends up being evolution&#8217;s fault. This story is no different.</p><p class=\"p1\">When it comes to reasoning, we&#8217;re biologically inclined to be cooks, not chefs, which relates back to our tribal evolutionary past. First, it&#8217;s a better tribal model for most people to be cooks. In 50,000 BC, tribes full of independent thinkers probably suffered from having too many chefs in the kitchen, which would lead to too many arguments and factions within the tribe. A tribe with a strong leader at the top and the rest of the members simply following the leader would fare better. So those types of tribes passed on their genes more than other tribes. And now we&#8217;re the collective descendants of the more cook-like people.</p><p>Second, it&#8217;s about our own well-being. It&#8217;s not in our DNA to be chefs because human self-preservation never depended upon independent thinking—it rode on fitting in with the tribe, on staying in favor with the chief, on following in the footsteps of the elders who knew more about staying alive than we did, and on teaching our children to do the same—which is why we now live in a cook society where cook parents raise their kids by telling them to follow the recipe and stop asking questions about it.</p><p>Thinking like cooks is what we&#8217;re born to do because what we&#8217;re born to do is survive.</p><p>But the weird thing is, we weren&#8217;t born into a normal human world. We&#8217;re living in the anomaly, when for many of the world&#8217;s people, survival is easy. Today&#8217;s privileged societies are full of anomaly humans whose primary purpose is already taken care of, softening the deafening roar of unmet base needs and allowing the nuanced and complex voice of our inner selves to awaken.</p><p>The problem is, most of our heads are still running on some version of the 50,000-year-old survival software—which kind of wastes the good luck we have to be born now.</p><p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate catch-22—we continue to think like cooks because we can&#8217;t absorb the epiphany that we live in an anomaly world where there&#8217;s no need to be cooks, and we can&#8217;t absorb that epiphany because we think like cooks and cooks don&#8217;t know how to challenge and update their own software.</p><p>This is the vicious cycle of our time—and the secret of the chef is that they somehow snapped out of it.</p><p>So how do we snap out of the trance?</p><p>I think there are three major epiphanies we need to absorb—three core things the chef knows that the cook doesn&#8217;t:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 1) You don&#8217;t know shit.</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/You-dont-know-shit.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4403 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/You-dont-know-shit.png\" alt=\"You don't know shit\" width=\"316\" height=\"278\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The flood geologists of the 17th and 18th centuries weren&#8217;t stupid. And they weren&#8217;t anti-science. Many of them were just as accomplished in their fields as their science geologist colleagues.</p><p>But they were victims—victims of a religious dogma they were told to believe without question. The recipe they followed was scripture, a recipe that turned out to be wrong. And as a result, they proceeded on their path with a fatal flaw in their thinking—a software bug that told them that one of the undeniable first principles when thinking about the Earth was that it began 6,000 years ago and that there had been a flood of the most epic proportions.</p><p>With that software bug in place, all further computations were moot. Any reasoning tree that puzzled upwards with those assumptions at its root had no chance of finding truth.</p><p>Even more than being victims of any dogma, the flood geologists were victims of their own certainty. Without certainty, dogma has no power. And when data is required in order to believe something, false dogma has no legs to stand on. It wasn&#8217;t the church dogma<em> </em>that hindered the flood geologists, it was the church <em>mentality</em> of faith-based certainty.</p><p>That&#8217;s what Stephen Hawking meant when he said, &#8220;The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.&#8221; Neither the science geologist nor the flood geologist started off with knowledge. But what gave the science geologist the power to seek out the truth was <em>knowing </em>that he lacked knowledge. The science geologists subscribed to the <em>lab</em> mentality, which starts by saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know shit&#8221; and works upwards from there.</p><p>If you want to see the lab mentality at work, just search for famous quotes of any prominent scientist and you&#8217;ll see each one of them expressing the fact that they don&#8217;t know shit.</p><p>Here&#8217;s Isaac Newton: <em>To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.</em></p><p>And Richard Feynman: <em>I was born not knowing and have had only a little time to change that here and there.</em></p><p>And Niels Bohr: <i>Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.</i></p><p>Musk has said his own version: <em>You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-12-4367\" id=\"note2-12-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p>The reason these outrageously smart people are so humble about what they know is that as scientists, they&#8217;re aware that unjustified certainty is the bane of understanding and the death of effective reasoning. They firmly believe that reasoning of all kinds should take place in a lab, not a church.</p><p>If we want to become more chef-like, we have to make sure we&#8217;re doing our thinking in a lab. Which means identifying which parts of our thinking are currently sitting in church.</p><p>But that&#8217;s a hard thing to do because m<span class=\"s1\">ost of us have the same relationship with our own software that my grandmother has with her computer:<a href=\"#footnote-10-4367\" id=\"note-10-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> It&#8217;s this thing someone put there, we use it when we need to, it somehow magically works, and we hope it doesn&#8217;t break. It&#8217;s the way we are with a lot of the things we own, where we&#8217;re just the dumb user, not the pro. We know how to use our car, microwave, phone, our electric toothbrush, but if something breaks, we take it to the pro to fix it because we have no idea how it works.</span></p><p>But that&#8217;s not a great life model when it comes to brain software, and it usually leads to us making the same mistakes and living with the same results year after year after year, because our software remains unchanged. Eventually, we might wake up one day feeling like <i>Breaking Bad&#8217;s </i>Walter White, when he said, &#8220;Sometimes I feel like I never actually make any of my own&#8230; choices. I mean, my entire life it just seems I never&#8230; had a real say about any of it.&#8221; If we want to understand our own thinking, we have to stop being the dumb user of our own software and start being the pro—the auto mechanic, the electrician, the computer geek.</p><p>If you were alone in a room with a car and wanted to figure out how it worked, you&#8217;d probably start by taking it apart as much as you could and examining the parts and how they all fit together. To do the same with our thinking, we need to revert to our four-year-old selves and start deconstructing our software by resuming the Why game our parents and teachers shut down decades ago. It&#8217;s time to roll up our sleeves, pop open the hood, and get our hands dirty with a bunch of not-that-fun questions about what we truly want, what&#8217;s truly possible, and whether the way we&#8217;re living our lives follows logically from those things.</p><p>With each of these questions, the challenge is to keep asking why until you hit the floor—and the floor is what will tell you whether you&#8217;re in a church or a lab for that particular part of your life. If a floor you hit is one or more first principles that represent the truth of reality or your inner self and the logic going upwards stays accurate to that foundation, you&#8217;re in the lab. If a Why? pathway hits a floor called &#8220;Because [authority] said so&#8221;—if you go down and down and realize at the bottom that the whole thing is just because you&#8217;re taking your parent&#8217;s or friend&#8217;s or religion&#8217;s or society&#8217;s word for it—then you&#8217;re in church there. And if the tenets of that church don&#8217;t truly resonate with you or reflect the current reality of the world—if it turns out that you’ve been working off of the wrong recipe—then whatever conclusions have been built on top of it will be just as wrong. As demonstrated by the flood geologists, a reasoning chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4465 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-1.jpg\" alt=\"False Dogma 1\" width=\"363\" height=\"386\" /></a></p><p>Astronomers once hit a similar wall in their progress trying to calculate the trajectories of the sun and planets in the Solar System. Then one day they discovered that the sun was at the center of things, not the Earth, and suddenly, all the perplexing calculations made sense, and progress leapt forward. Had they played the Why game earlier, they&#8217;d have run into a dogmatic floor right after the question &#8220;But why do we know that the Earth is in the center of everything?&#8221;</p><p>People&#8217;s lives are no different, which is why it&#8217;s so important to find the toxic lumps of false dogma tucked inside the layers of your reasoning software. Identifying one and adjusting it can strengthen the whole chain above and create a breakthrough in your life.</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-4466 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/False-Dogma-2.jpg\" alt=\"False Dogma 2\" width=\"364\" height=\"386\" /></p><p>The thing you really want to look closely for is unjustified certainty. Where in life do you feel so right about something that it doesn&#8217;t qualify as a hypothesis or even a theory, but it feels like a <em>proof?</em> When there&#8217;s proof-level certainty, it means either there&#8217;s some serious concrete and verified data underneath it—or it&#8217;s faith-based dogma. Maybe you feel certain that quitting your job would be a disaster or certain that there&#8217;s no god or certain that it&#8217;s important to go to college or certain that you&#8217;ve always had a great time on rugged vacations or certain that everyone loves it when you break out the guitar during a group hangout—but if it&#8217;s not well backed-up by data from what you&#8217;ve learned and experienced, it&#8217;s at best a hypothesis and at worst a completely false piece of dogma.</p><p>And if thinking about all of that ends with you drowning in some combination of self-doubt, self-loathing, and identity crisis, that&#8217;s perfect. This first epiphany is about humility. Humility is by definition a starting point—and it sends you off on a journey from there. The arrogance of certainty is both a starting point and an ending point—no journeys needed. That’s why it’s so important that we begin with &#8220;I don&#8217;t know shit.&#8221; That&#8217;s when we know we&#8217;re in the lab.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 2) No

18\" width=\"500\" height=\"612\" /></a></p><p>Yes, it&#8217;s an old classic. The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes. It was written in 1837 by Hans Christian Andersen<a href=\"#footnote-11-4367\" id=\"note-11-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> to demonstrate a piece of trademark human insanity: the &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t seem right to me but everyone else says it&#8217;s right so it must be right and I&#8217;ll just pretend I also think it&#8217;s right so no one realizes I&#8217;m stupid&#8221; phenomenon.</p><p>My favorite all-time quote might be Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEiSa6_EPA\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> this:</p><p><em>When you grow up, you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you&#8217;ll never be the same again.</em><a href=\"#footnote-12-4367\" id=\"note-12-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a><p>This is Jobs&#8217; way of saying, &#8220;You might not know shit. But <em>no </em>one knows shit. If the emperor looks naked to you and everyone else is saying he has clothes, trust your eyes since other people don&#8217;t know anything you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s an easy message to understand, a harder one to believe, and an even harder one to act on.</p><p>The purpose of the first epiphany is to shatter the belief that all that dogma you&#8217;ve memorized constitutes personal opinions and wisdom and all that certainty you feel constitutes knowledge and understanding. That&#8217;s the easier one because the delusion that we know what we&#8217;re talking about is pretty fragile, with the &#8220;Oh god I&#8217;m a fraud who doesn&#8217;t know shit&#8221; monster never lurking too far under our consciousness.</p><p>But this epiphany—that the collective &#8220;other people&#8221; and their conventional wisdom don&#8217;t know shit—is a much larger challenge. Our delusion about the wisdom of those around us, our tribe, and society as a whole is much thicker and runs much deeper than the delusion about ourselves. So deep that we&#8217;ll see a naked emperor and ignore our own eyes if everyone else says he has clothes on.</p><p>This is a battle of two kinds of confidence—confidence in others vs. confidence in ourselves. For most cooks, confidence in others usually comes out the winner.</p><p>To swing the balance, we need to figure out how to <em>lose respect</em> for the general public, your tribe&#8217;s dogma, and society&#8217;s conventional wisdom. We have a bunch of romantic words for the world’s chefs that sound impressive but are actually just a result of them having lost this respect. Being a <em>gamechanger </em>is just having little enough respect for the game that you realize there’s no good reason not to change the rules. Being a <em>trailblazer</em> is just not respecting the beaten path and so deciding to blaze yourself a new one. Being a <em>groundbreaker</em> is just knowing that the ground wasn’t laid by anyone that impressive and so feeling no need to keep it intact.</p><p>Not respecting society is totally counterintuitive to what we&#8217;re taught when we grow up—but it makes perfect sense if you just look at what your eyes and experience tell you.</p><p>There are clues all around showing us that conventional wisdom doesn&#8217;t know shit. Conventional wisdom worships the status quo and always assumes that everything is the way it is for a good reason—and history is one long record of status quo dogma being proven wrong again and again, every time some chef comes around and changes things.</p><p>And if you open your eyes, there are other clues all through your own life that the society you live in is nothing to be intimidated by. All the times you learn about what really goes on inside a company and find out that it&#8217;s totally disorganized and badly run. All the people in high places who can&#8217;t seem to get their personal lives together. All the well-known sitcoms whose jokes you&#8217;re pretty sure you could have written when you were 14. All the politicians who don&#8217;t seem to know more about the world than you do.</p><p>And yet, the delusion that society knows shit that you don&#8217;t runs deep, and still, somewhere in the back of your head, you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic that you<em> </em>could ever actually build that company, achieve that fabulous wealth or celebrity-status, create that TV show, win that senate campaign—no matter what<em> </em>it <em>seems</em> like.</p><p>Sometimes it takes an actual experience to fully expose society for the shit it doesn&#8217;t know. One example from my life is how I slowly came to understand that most Americans—the broader public, my tribe, and people I know well—knew very little about what it&#8217;s actually like to visit most countries. I grew up hearing about how dangerous it was to visit really foreign places, especially alone. But when I started going places I wasn&#8217;t supposed to go, I kept finding that the conventional wisdom had been plain wrong about it. As I had more experiences and gathered more actual data, I grew increasingly trusting of my own reasoning over whatever Americans were saying. And as my confidence grew, places like Thailand and Spain turned into places like Oman and Uzbekistan which turned into places like Nigeria and North Korea. When it comes to traveling, I had the epiphany: other people&#8217;s strong opinions about this are based on unbacked-up dogma and the fact that most people I talk to feel the same way means nothing if my own research, experience, and selective question-asking brings me to a different conclusion.<a href=\"#footnote-13-4367\" id=\"note-13-4367\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a> When it comes to picking travel destinations, I&#8217;ve become a chef.</p><p>I try to leverage what I learned as a traveler to transfer the chefness elsewhere—when I find myself discouraged in another part of my life by the warnings and head-shaking of conventional wisdom, I try to remind myself: <em>&#8220;These are the same people that were sure that North Korea was dangerous.&#8221; </em>It&#8217;s hard—you have to take the leap to chefdom separately in each part of your life—but it seems like with each successive cook → chef breakthrough, future breakthroughs become easier to come by. <span class=\"s1\">Eventually, you must hit a tipping point and trusting your own software becomes your way of life—and as Jobs says, you&#8217;ll never be the same again.</span></p><p>The first epiphany was about shattering a protective shell of arrogance to lay bare a starting point of humility. This second epiphany is about confidence—the confidence to emerge from that humility through a pathway built on first principles instead of by analogy. It&#8217;s a confidence that says, &#8220;I may not know much, but no one else does either, so I might as well be the most knowledgeable person on Earth.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Epiphany 3) You&#8217;re playing Grand Theft Life</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grand-Theft-Life.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4394 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Grand-Theft-Life.png\" alt=\"Grand Theft Life\" width=\"270\" height=\"298\" /></a></p><p>The first two epiphanies allow us to break open our software, identify which parts of it were put there by someone else, and with confidence begin to fill in the Want and Reality boxes with our own handwriting and choose a goal and a strategy that&#8217;s right for us.</p><p>But then we hit a snag. We&#8217;re finally in the lab with all our tools and equipment, but something holds us back. To figure out why, let&#8217;s bring back our emperor story.</p><p>When the emperor struts out with his shoulder hair and his gut and his little white junk, the story only identifies two kinds of people: the mass of subjects, who all pretend they can see the clothes, and the kid, who just says that the dude is obviously naked.</p><p>But I think there&#8217;s more going on. In an emperor&#8217;s new clothes situation, there are <em>four </em>kinds of people:</p><p><strong>1) Proud Cook. </strong>Proud Cook is the person drinking the full dogma Kool-Aid. Whatever independent-thinking voice <em>is</em> inside of Proud Cook was silenced long ago, and there&#8217;s no distinction between his thoughts and the dogma he follows. As far as he&#8217;s concerned, the dogma is truth—but since he doesn&#8217;t even register that there&#8217;s any dogma happening, Proud Cook simply thinks he&#8217;s a very wise person who has it all figured out. He feels the certainty of the dogma running through his veins. When the emperor walks out and proclaims that he is wearing beautiful new clothes, Proud Cook actually <em>sees</em> clothes, because his consciousness isn&#8217;t even turned on.</p><p><strong>2) Insecure Cook. </strong>Insecure Cook is what Proud Cook turns into after undergoing Epiphany #1. Insecure Cook has had a splash of self-awareness—enough to become conscious of the fact that he doesn&#8217;t actually know why he&#8217;s so certain about the things he&#8217;s certain about. Whatever the reasons are, he&#8217;s sure they&#8217;re right, but he can&#8217;t seem to come up with them himself. Without the blissful arrogance of Proud Cook, Insecure Cook is lost in the world, wondering why he&#8217;s too dumb to get what everyone else gets and trying to watch others to figure out what he&#8217;s supposed to do—all while hoping nobody finds out that he doesn&#8217;t get it. When Insecure Cook sees the emperor, his heart sinks—he doesn&#8217;t <em>see </em>the clothes, only the straggly gray hairs of the emperor&#8217;s upper thighs. Ashamed, he reads the crowd and mimics their enthusiasm for the clothes.</p><p><strong>3) Self-Loathing Cook. </strong>Self-Loathing Cook is what Insecure Cook becomes after being hit by Epiphany #2. Epiphany #2 is the forbidden fruit, and Self-Loathing Cook has bitten it. He now knows <em>exactly </em>why he didn&#8217;t feel certain about everything—because it was all bullshit. He sees the tenets of conventional wisdom for what they really are—faith-based dogma. He knows that neither he nor anyone else knows shit and that he&#8217;ll get much farther riding his own reasoning than jumping on the bandwagon with the masses. When the emperor emerges, Self-Loathing Cook thinks, &#8220;Oh Jesus&#8230;this fucktard is actually outside with no clothes on. Oh—oh and my god these idiots are all <em>pretending to see clothes</em>. How is this my life? I need to move.&#8221;</p><p>But then, right when he&#8217;s about to call everyone out on their pretending and the emperor out on his bizarre life decision, there&#8217;s a lump in his throat. Sure, he knows there are no clothes on that emperor&#8217;s sweaty lower back fat roll—but actually <em>saying</em> that? Out <em>loud?</em> I mean, he&#8217;s sure and all—but let&#8217;s not go crazy here. Better not to call too much attention to himself. And of course, there&#8217;s a <em>chance</em> he&#8217;s missing something. Right?</p><p>Self-Loathing Cook ends up staying quiet and nodding at the other cooks when they ask him if those clothes aren&#8217;t just the most marvelous he&#8217;s ever seen.</p><p><b>4) The chef. </b>The kid in the story. The chef is Self-Loathing Cook—except without the irrational fear. The chef goes through the same inner thought process as Self-Loathing Cook, but when it&#8217;s time to walk the walk, the chef stands up and yells out the truth.</p><p>A visual recap:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-Subjects.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4382\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4-Subjects.png\" alt=\"4 Subjects\" width=\"650\" height=\"333\" /></a></p><p>We&#8217;re all human and we&#8217;re all complex, which means that in various parts of each of our lives, we play each of these four characters.</p><p>But to me, Self-Loathing Cook is the most curious one of the four. Self-Loathing Cook gets it. He knows what the chefs know. He&#8217;s tantalizingly close to carving out his own chef path in the world, and he knows that if he just <em>goes</em> for it, good things would happen. But he can&#8217;t pull the trigger. He built himself a pair of wings he feels confident work just fine, but he can&#8217;t bring himself to jump off the cliff.</p><p>And as he stands there next to the cliff with the other cooks, he has to endure the torture of watching the chefs of the world leap off the edge with the same exact wings and flying skills he has, but with the courage he can&#8217;t seem to find.</p><p>To figure out what&#8217;s going on with Self-Loathing Cook, let&#8217;s remind ourselves how the chefs operate.</p><p>Free of Self-Loathing Cook&#8217;s trepidation, the world&#8217;s chefs are liberated to put on their lab coats and start sciencing. To a chef, the world is one giant laboratory, and their life is one long lab session full of a million experiments. They spend their days puzzling, and society is their game board.</p><p>The chef treats his goals and undertakings as experiments whose purpose is as much to learn new information as it is to be ends in themselves. That&#8217;s why when I asked Musk what his thoughts were on negative feedback, he answered with this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>I’m a huge believer in taking feedback. I’m trying to create a mental model that’s accurate, and if I have a wrong view on something, or if there’s a nuanced improvement that can be made, I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;I used to think this one thing that turned out to be wrong—now thank goodness I don’t have that wrong belief.&#8221;</em></p><p class=\"p1\">To a chef in the lab, negative feedback is a free boost forward in progress, courtesy of someone else. Pure upside.</p><p class=\"p1\">As for the F word&#8230;the word that makes our amygdalae quiver in the moonlight, the great chefs have something to say about that too:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. </em>—Henry Ford</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.</em> —Winston Churchill<a href=\"#footnote2-13-4367\" id=\"note2-13-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a><p class=\"p1\"><em>I have not failed 700 times. I’ve succeeded in proving 700 ways how not to build a lightbulb.</em> —Thomas Edison</p><p class=\"p1\">There&#8217;s no more reliable corollary than super-successful people thinking failure is fucking <em>awesome</em>.</p><p class=\"p1\">But there&#8217;s something to that. The science approach is all about learning through testing hypotheses, and hypotheses are built to be disproven, which means that scientists learn through failure. Failure is a critical part of their process.</p><p class=\"p1\">It makes sense. If there were two scientists trying to come up with a breakthrough in cancer treatment, and the first one is trying every bold thing he can imagine, failing left and right and learning something each time, while the second one is determined not to have any failures so is making sure his experiments are similar to others that have already been proven to work—which scientist would you bet on?</p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s not surprising that so many of the most wildly impactful people seem to treat the world like a lab and their life like an experiment session—that&#8217;s the best way to succeed at something.</p><p class=\"p1\">But for most of us, we just can&#8217;t do it. Even poor Self-Loathing Cook, who is so damn close to being a chef—but somehow so far away.</p><p>So what&#8217;s stopping him? I think two major misconceptions:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Misconception 1: Misplaced Fear</strong></span></p><p>We talked about the chef&#8217;s courage actually just being an accurate assessment of risk—and that&#8217;s one of the major things Self-Loathing Cook is missing. He thinks he has become wise to the farce of letting dogma dictate your life, but he&#8217;s actually in the grasp of dogma&#8217;s slickest trick.</p><p>Humans are programmed to take fear <em>very </em>seriously, and evolution didn&#8217;t find it efficient to have us assess and re-assess every fear inside of us. It went instead with the &#8220;better safe than sorry&#8221; philosophy—i.e. if there&#8217;s a chance that a certain fear might be based on real danger, file it away as a real fear, just in case, and even if you confirm later that a fear of yours has no basis, keep it with you, just in case. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>And the fear file cabinet is somewhere <em>way </em>down in our psyches—somewhere far below our centers of rationality, out of reach.</p><p>The purpose of all of that fear is to make us protect ourselves from danger. The problem for us is that as far as evolution is concerned, danger = something that hurts the chance that your genes will move on—i.e., danger = not mating or dying or your kids dying, and that&#8217;s about it.</p><p>So in the same way our cook-like qualities were custom-built for survival in tribal times, our obsession with fears of all shapes and sizes may have served us well in Ethiopia 50,000 years ago—but it mostly ruins our lives today.</p><p>Because not only does it amp up our fear in general to &#8220;shit we botched the hunt now the babies are all going to starve to death this winter&#8221; levels even though we live in an &#8220;oh no I got laid off now I have to sleep at my parents&#8217; house for two months with a feather pillow in ideal 68º temperature&#8221; world—but it also programs us to be terrified of all the wrong things. We&#8217;re more afraid of public speaking than texting on the highway, more afraid of approaching an attractive stranger in a bar than marrying the wrong person, more afraid of not being able to afford the same lifestyle as our friends than spending 50 years in meaningless career—all because embarrassment, rejection, and not fitting in really sucked for hunters and gatherers.</p><p>This leaves most of us with a skewed danger scale:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Danger-Scale.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4467 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Danger-Scale.png\" alt=\"Danger Scale\" width=\"501\" height=\"255\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">Chefs hate real risk just as much as cooks—a chef that ends up in the Actually Dangerous territory and ends up in jail or in a gutter or in dire financial straits isn&#8217;t a chef—he&#8217;s a cook living under &#8220;I&#8217;m invincible&#8221; dogma. When we see chefs displaying what looks like incredible courage, they&#8217;re usually just in the Chef Lab. The Chef Lab is where all the action is and where the path to many people&#8217;s dreams lies—dreams about their career, about love, about adventure. But even though its doors are always open, most people never set foot in it for the same reason so many Americans never visit some of the world&#8217;s most interesting countries—because of an incorrect assumption that it&#8217;s a dangerous place. By reasoning by analogy when it comes to what constitutes danger and ending up with a misconception, Self-Loathing Cook is missing out on all the fun.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Misconception 2: Misplaced Identity</strong></span></p><p class=\"p1\">The second major problem for Self-Loathing Cook is that, like all cooks, he can&#8217;t wrap his head around the fact that he&#8217;s the scientist in the lab—not the experiment.</p><p class=\"p1\">As we established earlier, conscious tribe members reach conclusions, while blind tribe members <em>are </em>conclusions. And what you believe, what you stand for, and what you choose to do each day are conclusions that you&#8217;ve drawn. In some cases, very, very publicly.</p><p class=\"p1\">As far as society is concerned, when you give something a try—on the values front, the fashion front, the religious front, the career front—you&#8217;ve branded yourself. And since people like to simplify people in order to make sense of things in their own head, the tribe around you reinforces your brand by putting you in a clearly-labeled, oversimplified box.</p><p class=\"p1\">What this all amounts to is that it becomes very painful to <em>change</em>. Changing is <em>icky </em>for someone whose identity will have to change along with it. And others don&#8217;t make things any easier. Blind tribe members don&#8217;t like when other tribe members change—it confuses them, it forces them to readjust the info in their heads, and it threatens the simplicity of their tribal certainty. So attempts to evolve are often met with opposition or mockery or anger.</p><p class=\"p1\">And when you have a hard time changing, you become attached to who you currently are and what you&#8217;re currently doing—so attached that it blurs the distinction between the scientist and the experiment and you forget that they&#8217;re two different things.</p><p class=\"p1\">We talked about why scientists welcome negative feedback about their experiments. But when you <em>are</em> the experiment, negative feedback isn&#8217;t a piece of new, helpful information—it&#8217;s an <em>insult</em>. And it <em>hurts</em>. And it makes you <em>mad</em>.<em> </em>And because changing feels impossible, there&#8217;s not much good that feedback can do anyway—it&#8217;s like giving parents negative feedback on the name of their one-month-old child.</p><p class=\"p1\">We discussed why scientists expect plenty of their experiments to fail. But when you and the experiment are one and the same, not only is taking on a new goal a change of identity, it&#8217;s putting your identity on the <em>line</em>. If the experiment fails, <em>you</em><em> </em>fail. You <em>are</em><em> </em>a failure. Devastating. Forever.</p><p class=\"p1\">I talked to Musk about the United States and the way the forefathers reasoned by first principles when they started the country. He said he thought the reason they could do so is that they had a fresh slate to work with. The European countries of that era would have had a much harder time trying to do something like that—because, as he told me, they were &#8220;trapped in their own history.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">I&#8217;ve heard Musk use this same phrase to describe the big auto and aerospace companies of today. He sees Tesla and SpaceX like the late 18th century USA—fresh new labs ready for experiments—but when he looks at other companies in their industries, he sees an inability to drive their strategies from a clean slate mentality. Referring to the aerospace industry, Musk said, <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">“There’s a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering.” </span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Being trapped in your history means you don&#8217;t know how to change, you&#8217;ve forgotten how to innovate, and you&#8217;re stuck in the identity box the world has put you in. And you end up being the cancer researcher we mentioned who only tries likely-to-succeed experimentation within the comfort zone he knows best. </span></p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s for this reason that Steve Jobs looks back on his firing from Apple in 1986 as a blessing in disguise. He said:<a href=\"#footnote2-14-4367\" id=\"note2-14-4367\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a> &#8220;Getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.&#8221; Being fired &#8220;freed&#8221; Jobs from the shackles of his own history.</p><p class=\"p1\">So what Self-Loathing Cook has to ask himself is: &#8220;Am I trapped in my own history?&#8221; As he stands on the cliff with his wings ready for action and finds himself paralyzed—from evolving as a person, from making changes in his life, from trying to do something bold or unusual—is the baggage of his own identity part of what&#8217;s holding him back?</p><p class=\"p1\">Self-Loathing Cook&#8217;s beliefs about what&#8217;s scary aren&#8217;t any more real than Insecure Cook&#8217;s assumption that conventional wisdom has all the answers—but unlike the &#8220;Other people don&#8217;t know shit&#8221; epiphany, which you can observe evidence of all over the place, the epiphany that neither failing nor changing is actually a big deal can only be observed by experiencing it for yourself. Which you can only do after you overcome those fears&#8230;which only happens if you experience changing and failing and realize that nothing bad happens. Another catch-22.</p><p class=\"p1\">These are the reasons I believe so many of the world&#8217;s most able people are stuck in life as Self-Loathing Cook, one epiphany short of the promised land.</p><p class=\"p1\">The challenge with this last epiphany is to somehow figure out a way to lose respect for your own <em>fear</em>. That respect is in our wiring, and the only way to weaken it is by <em>defying </em>it and seeing, when nothing bad ends up happening, that most of the fear you&#8217;ve been feeling has just been a smoke and mirrors act. Doing something out of your comfort zone and having it turn out okay is an incredibly powerful experience, one that changes you—and each time you have that kind of experience, it chips away at your respect for your brain&#8217;s ingrained, irrational fears.</p><p class=\"p1\">Because the most important thing the chef knows that the cooks don&#8217;t is that real life and Grand Theft Auto aren&#8217;t actually that different. Grand Theft Auto is a fun video game because it&#8217;s a fake world where you can do things with no fear. Drive 200mph on the highway. Break into a building. Run over a prostitute with your car. All good in GTA.</p><p class=\"p1\">Unlike GTA, in real life, the law is a thing and jail is a thing. But that&#8217;s about where the differences end. If someone gave you a perfect simulation of today&#8217;s world to play in and told you that it&#8217;s all fake with no actual consequences—with the only rules being that you can&#8217;t break the law or harm anyone, and you still have to make sure to support your and your family&#8217;s basic needs—what would you do? My guess is that most people would do all kinds of things they&#8217;d love to do in their real life but wouldn&#8217;t dare to try, and that by behaving that way, they&#8217;d end up quickly getting a life going in the simulation that&#8217;s both far more successful and much truer to themselves than the real life they&#8217;re currently living. Removing the fear and the concern with identity or the opinions of others would thrust the person into the not-actually-risky Chef Lab and have them bouncing around all the exhilarating places outside their comfort zone—and their lives would take off. That&#8217;s the life irrational fears block us from.</p><p class=\"p1\">When I look at the amazing chefs of our time, what&#8217;s clear is that they&#8217;re more or less treating real life as if it&#8217;s Grand Theft Life. And doing so gives them superpowers. That&#8217;s what I think Steve Jobs meant all the times he said, &#8220;Stay hungry. Stay foolish.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">And that&#8217;s what this third epiphany is about: fearlessness.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\">So if we want to think like a scientist more often in life, those are the three key objectives—to be humbler about what we know, more confident about what&#8217;s possible, and less afraid of things that don&#8217;t matter.</p><p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s a good plan—but also, ugh. Right? That&#8217;s a lot of stuff to try to do.</p><p class=\"p1\">Usually at the end of a post like this, the major point seems manageable and concrete, and I finish writing it all excited to go be good at shit. But this post was like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s everything important and go do it.&#8221; So how do we work with that?</p><p class=\"p1\">I think the key is to not try to be a perfect chef or expect that of yourself whatsoever. Because no one&#8217;s a perfect chef—not even Elon. And no one&#8217;s a pure cook either—nothing&#8217;s black and white when you&#8217;re talking about an animal species whose brains contain 86 billion neurons. The reality is that we&#8217;re all a little of both, and where we are on that spectrum varies in 100 ways, depending on the part of life in question, the stage we&#8217;re in of our evolution, and our mood that day.</p><p class=\"p1\">If we want to improve ourselves and move our way closer to the chef side of the spectrum, we have to remember to remember. We have to remember that we have software, not just hardware. We have to remember that reasoning is a skill and like any skill, you get better at it if you work on it. And we have to remember the cook/chef distinction, so we can notice when we&#8217;re being like one or the other.</p><p>It&#8217;s fitting that this blog is called Wait But Why because the whole thing is a little like the grown-up version of the Why? game. After emerging from the blur of the arrogance of my early twenties, I began to realize that my software was full of a lot of unfounded certainty and blind assumptions and that I needed to spend some serious time <em>deconstructing—</em>which is the reason that every Wait But Why post, no matter what the topic, tends to start off with the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s really going on here?&#8221;</p><p>For me, that question is the springboard into all of this remembering to remember—it&#8217;s a hammer that shatters a brittle, protective feeling of certainty and forces me to do the hard work of building a more authentic, more useful set of thoughts about something. Or at least a better-embraced bewilderment.</p><p>And when I started learning about Musk in preparation to write these posts, it hit me that he wasn&#8217;t just doing awesome things in the world—he was a master at looking at the world, asking &#8220;What&#8217;s really going on here?&#8221; and seeing the real answer. That&#8217;s why his story resonated so hard with me and why I dedicated so much Wait But Why time to this series.</p><p>But also, Mars.

When I started, I never intended for it to become such an ordeal. But like the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla post</a>, I decided as I researched that this was A) a supremely important topic that will only become more important in the years to come, and B) something most people don’t know nearly enough about. My weeks of research and discussions with Musk and others built me an in-depth, tree-trunk understanding of what’s happening in what I’m calling The Story of Humans and Space—one that has totally reframed my mental picture of the future (yet again). And as I planned out what to include in the post, I wanted to make sure every Wait But Why reader ended up with the same foundation moving forward—because with everything that’s coming, we’re gonna need it. So like the Tesla post, this post became a full situation. Even the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/07/the-spacex-post-progress-meter.html\" target=\"_blank\">progress updates</a> leading up to its publication became a full situation.</p><p>Thanks for your patience. I know you’d prefer this not to be a site that updates every two months, and I would too. The Tesla and SpaceX posts were special cases, and you can expect a return to more normal-length WBW posts now that they’re done.</p><p>About the post itself: There are three main parts. Part 1 provides the context and background, Part 2 explores the “Why” part of colonizing Mars, and Part 3 digs into the “How.” To make reading this post as accessible as possible, it’s broken into five pages, each about the length of a normal WBW post, and you can jump to any part of the post easily by clicking the links in the Table of Contents below. We’re also trying two new things, both coming in the next couple days:</p><p><strong>1) <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/spacex-post-pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A PDF</a>: </strong> We’ve had a lot of requests for a PDF version of the longer posts, and since this is the longest post in written history, we thought it would be a good time to give it a try. All the post’s footnotes are displayed in the margins, so you won’t lose those, and when read on a screen, the PDF will have working hyperlinks as well.</p><p><strong>There are two versions of the PDF: Normal and G-Rated. </strong>The G-Rated version is totally clean an appropriate for all ages.</p><p>The PDF costs $3 (which covers with both versions).

All those things she had always heard about—buildings that were constructed hundreds of years before the first human set foot on Ganymede; animals the size of a house; oceans the size of her whole world; tropical beaches; the famous blue sky; the giant sun that’s so close it can burn your skin; and the weirdest part—<em>no Jupiter hovering overhead</em>. Having seen it all in so many movies, she felt like she was going to visit a legendary movie set. It was too much to think about all at once. For now, she just had to focus on making sure she had everything she needed and saying goodbye to everyone—it would be a long time before she would see them again…</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a>Part 1: The Story of Humans and Space</strong></span></p><p>About six million years ago, a very important female great ape had two children. One of her children would go on to become the common ancestor of all chimpanzees. The other would give birth to a line that would one day include the entire human race. While the descendants of her first child would end up being pretty normal and monkey-ish, as time passed, strange things began to happen with the lineage of the other.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3902\" id=\"note-1-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3902\" id=\"note2-1-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> <strong><sup><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">←</span> click these</sup></strong></p><p>We’re not quite sure why, but over the next six million years, our ancestral line started to do something no creatures on Earth had ever done before—they woke up.</p><p>It happened slowly and gradually through the thousands of generations the same way your brain slowly comes to in the first few seconds after you rouse from sleep. But as the clarity increased, our ancestors started to look around and, for the very first time, <em>wonder</em>.</p><p>Emerging from a 3.6-billion-year dream, life on Earth had its first questions.</p><p><em>What is this big room we’re in, and who put us here? What is that bright yellow circle on the ceiling and where does it go every night? Where does the ocean end and what happens when you get there? Where are all the dead people now that they’re not here anymore? </em></p><p>We had discovered our species’ great mystery novel—<em>Where Are We?</em>—and we wanted to learn how to read it.</p><p>As the light of human consciousness grew brighter and brighter, we began to arrive at answers that seemed to make sense. Maybe we were on top of a floating disk, and maybe that disk was on top of a huge turtle. Maybe the pinpricks of light above us at night are a glimpse into what lies beyond this big room—and maybe that’s where we go when we die. Maybe if we can find the place where the ceiling meets the floor, we can poke our heads through and see all the super fun stuff on the other side.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3902\" id=\"note2-2-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flammarion1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4088\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flammarion1.jpg\" alt=\"Flammarion\" width=\"527\" height=\"439\" /></a></p><p>Around 10,000 years ago, isolated tribes of humans began to merge together and form the first cities. In larger communities, people were able to talk to each other about this mystery novel we had found, comparing notes across tribes and through the generations. As the techniques for learning became more sophisticated and the clues piled up, new discoveries surfaced.</p><p>The world was apparently a ball, not a disk. Which meant that the ceiling was actually a larger sphere surrounding us. The sizes of the other objects floating out there in the sphere with us, and the distances between them, were vaster than we had ever imagined. And then, something upsetting:</p><p>The sun wasn’t revolving around us. We were revolving around the sun.</p><p>This was a <em>super </em>unwarm, unfuzzy discovery. Why the <em>hell</em> weren’t we in the center of things? What did that mean?</p><p><em>Where are we?</em></p><p>The sphere was already unpleasantly big—if we weren’t in the center of it, were we just on a random ball inside of it, kind of for no apparent reason? Could this really be what was happening?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Earth.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4163\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Earth.png\" alt=\"Tiny Earth\" width=\"629\" height=\"362\" /></a></p><p>Scary.</p><p>Then things got worse.</p><p>It seemed that the pinpricks of light on the edge of the sphere weren’t what we thought they were—they were other suns like ours. And they were out there floating just like our sun—which means <em>we weren’t inside of a sphere at all</em>. Not only was our planet not the center of things, even our <em>sun </em>was just a random dude out there, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothingness.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Sun.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4164\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Sun.png\" alt=\"Tiny Sun\" width=\"650\" height=\"374\" /></a></p><p><em>Scary.</em></p><p>Our sun turned out to be a little piece of something much bigger.

We were deciphering the pages of <em>Where Are We?</em> at our own peril, and we had deciphered our way right into the knowledge that we’re unbelievably alone, living on a lonely island inside a lonely island inside a lonely island, buried in layers of isolation, with no one to talk to.</p><p>That’s our situation.</p><p>In the most recent 1% of our species’ short existence, we have become the first life on Earth to know about the Situation—and we’ve been having a collective existential crisis ever since.</p><p>You really can’t blame us. Imagine not realizing that the universe is a thing and <em>then realizing the universe is a thing</em>. It’s a <em>lot </em>to take in.</p><p>Most of us handle it by living in a pleasant delusion, pretending that the only place we live is in an endless land of colors and warmth. We’re like this guy, who’s doing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bWyhj7siEY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13s\" target=\"_blank\">everything he possibly can</a> to ignore the Situation:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3902\" id=\"note2-3-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/zipgif1.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-4235 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/zipgif1.gif\" alt=\"zipgif1\" width=\"350\" height=\"262\" /></a></p><p>And our best friend for this activity? The clear blue sky. The blue sky seems like it was <em>invented </em>to help humans pretend the Situation doesn’t exist, serving as the perfect whimsical backdrop to shield us from reality.</p><p>Then nighttime happens, and there’s the Situation, staring us right in the face.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Stars.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-4241 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Stars.jpg\" alt=\"Stars\" width=\"606\" height=\"401\" /></a></p><p><i>Oh yeah…</i></p><p>This la-di-da  →  oh yeah…  →  la-di-da  →  oh yeah… merry-go-round of psychosis was, for most of recent history, the extent of our relationship with the Situation.</p><p>But in the last 60 years, that relationship has vaulted to a whole new level. During World War II, missile technology leapt forward,<a href=\"#footnote-2-3902\" id=\"note-2-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> and for the first time, a new, mind-blowing concept was possible—</p><p><em>Space travel.</em></p><p>For thousands of years, The Story of Humans and Space had been the story of staring out and wondering. The possibility of people leaving our Earth island and <em>venturing out</em><em>into space</em> burst open the human spirit of adventure.</p><p>I imagine a similar feeling in the people of the 15th century, during the Age of Discovery, when we were working our way through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg\" target=\"_blank\">world map chapter</a> of <em>Where Are We?</em> and the notion of cross-ocean voyages dazzled people’s imaginations. If you asked a child in 1495 what they wanted to be when they grew up, “an ocean explorer” would probably have been a common response.</p><p>In 1970, if you asked a child the same question, the answer would be, “an astronaut”—i.e. <em>a Situation explorer</em>.</p><p>WWII advanced the possibility of human space travel, but it was in late 1957, when the Soviets launched the first man-made object into orbit, the adorable <a href=\"http://www.bisbos.com/images_spacecraft/sputnik_1_800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Sputnik 1</a>, that space travel became <em>the </em>defining quest of the world’s great powers.</p><p>At the time, the Cold War was in full throttle, and the US and Soviets had their measuring sticks out for an internationally-televised penis-measuring contest. With the successful launch of Sputnik, the Soviet penis bolted out by a few centimeters, horrifying the Americans.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4126\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest1.png\" alt=\"Contest1\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" /></a></p><p>To the Soviets, putting a satellite into space before the US was proof that Soviet technology was superior to American technology, which in turn was put forward as proof, for all the world to see, that communism was a system superior to capitalism.</p><p>Eight months later, NASA was born.</p><p>The Space Race had begun, and NASA’s first order of business would be to get a man into space, and then a man into full orbit, preferably both before the Soviets. The US was not to be shown up again.</p><p>In 1959, NASA launched Project Mercury to carry out the mission. They were on the verge of success when in April of 1961, the Soviets launched Yuri Gagarin into a full orbit around the Earth, making the first human in space <em>and</em> in orbit a Soviet.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4127\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest2.png\" alt=\"Contest2\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" /></a></p><p>It was time for drastic measures. John F. Kennedy’s advisors <a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told him</a> that the Soviets had too big a lead for the US to beat them at any near-term achievements—but that the prospect of a manned <em>moon</em> landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to get <em>there</em> first. So Kennedy gave his famous “we choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hahhd” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m32s\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a>, and directed an outrageous amount of funding at the mission ($20 billion, or $205 billion in today’s dollars).</p><p>The result was Project Apollo. Apollo’s mission was to land an American on the moon—and to do it <em>first</em>. The Soviets answered with Soyuz, their own moon program, and the race was on.</p><p>As the early phases of Apollo started coming together, Project Mercury finally hit its stride. Just a month after Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, American astronaut Alan Shepard became the second man in space, completing a <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Freedom_7_Diagram.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">little arc</a> that didn’t put him in full orbit but allowed him to give space a high-five at the top of the arc. A few months later, in February of 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.</p><p>The next seven years saw 22 US and Soviet manned launches as the superpowers honed their skills and technology. By late 1968, the furiously-sprinting US had more total launches under their belt (17) than the Soviets (10), and together, the two nations had mastered what we call Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LEO.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4115\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LEO.jpg\" alt=\"LEO\" width=\"653\" height=\"516\" /></a></p><p>But LEO hadn’t really excited anyone since the early ’60s. Both powers had their sights firmly set on the moon. The Apollo program was making quick leaps, and in December of 1968, the US became the first nation to soar outside of LEO. Apollo 8 made it all the way to the moon’s orbit and circled around 10 times before returning home safely. The crew, which included James Lovell (who a few months later played the role of Tom Hanks on the Apollo 13 mission), shattered the human altitude record and became the first people to see the moon up close, the first to see the “dark” side of the moon, and the first to see the Earth as a whole planet, snapping this iconic photo:<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3902\" id=\"note2-4-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3919 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg\" alt=\"1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\" /></a></p><p>Upon return, the crew became America’s most celebrated heroes—which I hope they enjoyed for eight months. Three Apollo missions later, in July of 1969, Apollo 11 made Americans Neil Armstrong<a href=\"#footnote-3-3902\" id=\"note-3-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> and Buzz Aldrin the first humans on the moon, and Armstrong took this famous photo of Aldrin looking all puffy:<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3902\" id=\"note2-5-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3920\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg\" alt=\"Aldrin_Apollo_11\" width=\"356\" height=\"356\" /></a></p><p>It’s hard to fully emphasize what a big deal this was. Ever since life on Earth began 3.6 billion years ago, no earthly creature had set foot on any celestial body other than the Earth. Suddenly, there are Armstrong and Aldrin, bouncing around <em>another </em>sphere, looking up in the sky where the moon is supposed to be and seeing the Earth instead. Insane.</p><p>Project Apollo proved to be a smashing success. Not only did Apollo get a man on the moon before the Soviets, the program sent 10 more men to the moon over the next 3.5 years on five other Apollo missions. There were six successful moon trips in seven tries, with the famous exception being Apollo 13, which was safely aborted after an explosion in the oxygen tank.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3902\" id=\"note-4-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p>The Soviet Soyuz program kept running into technical problems, and it never ended up putting someone on the moon.</p><p>The final Apollo moonwalk took place in late 1972. In only one decade, we had conquered nearby space, and progress was accelerating. If at that time you had asked any American, or any other human, what the coming decades of space travel would bring, they’d have made big, bold predictions. Many more people on the moon, a permanent moon base, people on Mars, and beyond.</p><p>So you can only imagine how surprised they’d be if you told them in 1972, after just watching 12 humans walk on the moon, that 43 years later, in the impossibly futuristic-sounding year 2015, the number of people to set foot on the moon <em>would still be 12</em>. Or that after leaving Low Earth Orbit in the dust years earlier and using it now as our pre-moon trip parking lot, 2015 would roll around and LEO would be the farthest out humans would ever go.</p><p>1972 people would be blown away by our smart phones and our internet, but they’d be just as shocked that we gave up on pushing our boundaries in space.</p><p>So what happened? After such a wildly exciting decade of human space adventure, why did we just <em>stop?</em></p><p>Well, like we found in the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla post</a>, “Why did we stop?” is the wrong question. Instead, we should ask:</p><p><em>Why were we ever adventurous about sending humans into space in the first place?</em></p><p>Space travel is unbelievably expensive. National budgets are incredibly tight. The fact is, it’s kind of surprising that a nation <em>ever</em> ponied up a sizable chunk of its budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries.</p><p>And that’s actually because no nation <em>did </em>blow their budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries—two nations blew their budgets because of a <em>penis</em>–<em>length</em> contest. In the face of international embarrassment at a time when everyone was trying to figure out whose economic system was better, the US government agreed to drop the usual rules for a few years to pour whatever resources were necessary on the problem to make sure they won that argument—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Early-budget.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4129\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Early-budget.png\" alt=\"Early budget\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" /></a></p><p>And once they won it, the contest was over and so were the special rules. And the US went back to spending money like a normal person.<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3902\" id=\"note2-6-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Full-budget.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4133\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Full-budget.png\" alt=\"Full budget\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" /></a></p><p>Instead of continuing to push the limits at all costs, the US and the Soviets got a grip, put their pants back on, shook hands, and started working together like adults on far more practical projects, like setting up a joint space station in LEO.</p><p>In the four decades since then, the Story of Humans and Space has again become confined to Earth, where we find ourselves with two primary reasons to interact with space (Note: the next whole chunk of the post is a slight diversion for an overview on satellites, space probes, and space telescopes. If that doesn’t excite you, I won’t be hurt if you skip down to the International Space Station section):</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>1) Support for Earth Industries</strong></span></p><p>The first and primary reason humans have interacted with space since the Apollo program isn’t about human interest in space. It’s about using space for practical purposes in support of industries on Earth—mostly in the form of satellites. The bulk of today’s rocket launches into space are simply putting things into LEO whose purpose is to look back down at Earth, not to the great expanses in the other direction.</p><p>Here’s a little satellite overview:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Satellites Blue Box</strong></span></p><p>We don’t think about them that often, but above us are hundreds of flying robots that play a large part in our lives on Earth. In 1957, lonely Sputnik circled the Earth by itself, but today, the worlds of communication, weather forecasting, television, navigation, and aerial photography all rely heavily on satellites, as do many national militaries and government intelligence agencies.</p><p>The total market for satellite manufacturing, the launches that carry them to space, and related equipment and services has ballooned from $60 billion in 2004 to over $200 billion in 2015. Satellite industry revenue today makes up only 4% of the global telecommunications industry but accounts for over 60% of space industry revenue.<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3902\" id=\"note2-7-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Here’s how the world’s satellites break down by role (in 2013):<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3902\" id=\"note2-8-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SatFunction1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3928\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SatFunction1.png\" alt=\"SatFunction\" width=\"459\" height=\"417\" /></a></p><p>Of the 1,265 active satellites in orbit at the beginning of 2015, the US owns by far <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/264472/number-of-satellites-in-orbit-by-operating-country/\" target=\"_blank\">the largest number</a> at 528—over 40% of the total—but over 50 countries own at least one orbiting satellite.</p><p>As for <em>where </em>all of these satellites are, most of them fall into two distinct “layers” of space:</p><p>About two-thirds of active satellites are in Low Earth Orbit. LEO starts up at 99 miles (160 km) above the Earth, the lowest altitude at which an object can orbit without atmospheric drag messing things up.  The top of LEO is 1,240 miles (2,000 km) up. Typically, the lowest satellites are at around 220 miles (350 km) up or higher.</p><p>Most of the rest (about one-third) of the satellites are much farther out, in a place called geostationary orbit (GEO). It’s right at 22,236 miles (35,786 km) above the Earth, and it’s called geostationary because something orbiting in it rotates at the exact speed that the Earth turns, making its position in the sky stationary relative to a point on the Earth. It’ll seem to be motionless to an observer on the ground.<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3902\" id=\"note2-9-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geostationaryjava3D.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3924 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geostationaryjava3D.gif\" alt=\"Geostationaryjava3D\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p>GEO is ideal for something like a TV satellite because a dish on the Earth can aim at the same fixed spot all the time.</p><p>A small percentage of other satellites are in medium Earth orbit (MEO), which is everything in between LEO and GEO. One notable resident of MEO is the GPS system that most Americans, and people from many other countries, use every day. I never realized that the entire GPS system, a US Department of Defense project that went live in 1995, only uses 32 satellites total. And until 2012, the number was only 24—six orbits, each with four satellites. But you can see in the GIF below that even with 24, a given point on the Earth can be seen by at least six of the satellites at any given time, and usually it’s nine or higher (in the GIF, the blue dot on the Earth is a hypothetical person on the ground, and whichever satellites can see him at a given time are blue, with the green lines showing their line of sight to the person):<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3902\" id=\"note2-10-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ConstellationGPS.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3925 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ConstellationGPS.gif\" alt=\"ConstellationGPS\" width=\"240\" height=\"192\" /></a></p><p>This is why your phone’s map can still show your location even when you’re somewhere with no cellular service—because it has nothing to do with cellular service. The system is also set up to be redundant—only four satellites need to simultaneously see you in order for the system to pinpoint your location. GPS satellites have an orbital period of about 12 hours, making two full rotations of the Earth each day.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3902\" id=\"note-5-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p>You can see satellite locations using <a href=\"http://www.gearthblog.com/satellites\" target=\"_blank\">Google Earth</a> (here’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydbbd-4oEds\" target=\"_blank\">cool video</a> of Google Earth showing the satellites).</p><div class=\"wbwAside2\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><b>Space Debris Bluer Box</b></span></p><p>There’s a big problem happening in the world of satellites. In addition to the 1,265 active satellites up in orbit, there are thousands more inactive satellites, as well as a bunch of spent rockets from previous missions. And once in a while, one of them explodes, or two of them collide, creating a ton of tiny fragments called space debris. The number of objects in space has risen quickly over recent decades, as a GIF<a href=\"#footnote-6-3902\" id=\"note-6-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> made by the ESA shows (with exaggerated-sized objects relative to the Earth’s size):<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3902\" id=\"note2-11-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3931 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb.gif\" alt=\"2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb\" width=\"675\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>The majority of satellites and debris are bunched around the Earth in LEO, and the outer ring of objects is what’s located in GEO.</p><p>Earth space agencies track about 17,000 objects in space, only 7% of which are active satellites.

As society moved on from space and turned its attention elsewhere, astronomers have kept busy at work deciphering their way through page after page of the old mystery novel, <em>Where Are We?</em> <em> </em></p><p>Astronomers learn best with their eyes, and a side effect of the Space Race was the development of far better technology for seeing<em> </em>what’s out there. There are two high-tech ways modern astronomers see things:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Looking and Learning Tool #1: Sending probes around the Solar System</strong></span></p><p>Basically, scientists fire a fancy robot toward some distant planet, moon, or asteroid, and the robot spends months or years flying through space, bored, until it finally arrives. Then, depending on the plan, it either just flies by the object, taking some pictures on the way, orbits the object to get more detailed information, or lands on the object for a full inspection. Everything it learns, it sends back to us, and one day, when its job is done, we either kill the probe by crashing it into the object or let it just fly out into deep space to be depressed.</p><p>I often use myself as a litmus test for what the public probably knows about or doesn’t know about. As I’ve mentioned before on this blog, I’ve been seriously dating astronomy ever since I was three years old—so if I don’t know something going on in the world of space, I assume that most people don’t. And when it comes to space probes, I’ve felt pretty disoriented. Are there 200 of them flying around out there? 50? 9? Why are they out there, who sent them, and what are they doing? All I’d know is that sometimes there would be a random story about some probe sending back stunning pictures—I’d open the cnn.com gallery, click through them, be thrilled for a second, send the link to the three friends of mine who are also dating astronomy, and then try to close the page but instead see some trashy CNN clickbait headline on the side of the page, click that, and ruin my life for the next three hateful hours. That’s my relationship with humanity’s space probes.</p><p>But in researching this post, I quickly realized there’s not that much to know, and it doesn’t take too big an effort to get fully oriented. Here are what I consider the eight key space robots to know about right now:<a href=\"#footnote2-17-3902\" id=\"note2-17-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">17</a><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">New Horizons</a> </strong>(Pluto, NASA)</span></p><p><a href=\"http://www.henrywurst.com/higher-resolutions-images-work-best-for-print-hello-pluto/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-4103 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_inline_nbou58vCQg1sglrr4.jpg\" alt=\"tumblr_inline_nbou58vCQg1sglrr4\" width=\"226\" height=\"188\" /></a></p><p>New Horizons goes first because its big moment just happened. Launched in 2006 on a decade-long trip to Pluto (sped up on its way by a Jupiter fly-by in 2007 that gravity-zinged it to a much faster speed), New Horizons <em>finally</em> reached Pluto on July 14th, 2015. It didn’t land on Pluto, but it flew very near to it and showed us Pluto for the first time:<a href=\"#footnote-8-3902\" id=\"note-8-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><a href=\"#footnote2-18-3902\" id=\"note2-18-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">18</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nh-pluto-in-true-color_2x_JPEG.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-4105 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nh-pluto-in-true-color_2x_JPEG.jpg\" alt=\"Nh-pluto-in-true-color_2x_JPEG\" width=\"249\" height=\"249\" /></a></p><p>Next, New Horizons will be on its way further outwards into the Kuiper belt to send back images of comets and dwarf planets.

While I agree with the common sentiment that it’s sad that Pluto’s sad about its demotion,<a href=\"#footnote-9-3902\" id=\"note-9-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> the truth is, Pluto should probably appreciate that it got away with 76 illegitimate years as a planet celebrity, pulling in a ton of Kuiper belt ass in the process, given that fellow Kuiper belt dwarf planet Eris spent that whole time living its life in total obscurity, only discovered in 2005.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Curiosity</a></strong> (Mars, NASA)</span></p><p><a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/curiosity-2nd-year/33248/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-4102 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/120803032331-nasa-mars-rover-horizontal-gallery.jpg\" alt=\"120803032331-nasa-mars-rover-horizontal-gallery\" width=\"420\" height=\"236\" /></a></p><p>Curiosity is a now-famous rover.

They’re both ridiculously far away now and going super fast. Voyager 1 is the faster of the two, going 38,000 mph (61,000 km/h)—so fast that it would cross the Atlantic Ocean in five minutes—and it’s the farthest man-made object from Earth, <a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/\" target=\"_blank\">currently</a> 131 AU<a href=\"#footnote-10-3902\" id=\"note-10-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> away from Earth. It was also the first man-made object to leave the Solar System. At this rate, Voyager 1 will reach Proxima Centauri, the closest star to us, in about 73,000 years.</p><p>Another cool thing about the Voyagers is that before they launched, a NASA committee, led by Carl Sagan, loaded them each up with a <a href=\"http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html\" target=\"_blank\">time capsule</a>, full of symbols, sounds, and images of Earth (and symbol instructions about how to play and view the media), so the probes can one day tell aliens what our deal is.

You know when you look at a light through a glass of water and the light is all bendy and silly? That’s what’s happening when stars twinkle, except instead of water, we’re looking at them through the Earth’s atmosphere. The atmosphere doesn’t distort light as much as water does, but stars and galaxies are <em>tiny </em>pinpricks of light in our sky, so any level of blur is a big problem—it’s like being underwater in a swimming pool and looking upwards, trying to examine a bunch of birds flying in the sky above.</p><p>In the 1960s, humans gained the ability to put telescopes in <em>space, </em>where they’d show us the first crystal-clear view of the stars in history.

And in its position in orbit 340 miles above Earth, where there’s no atmosphere or light pollution in the way, the Hubble is on what NASA calls “the ultimate mountaintop.”<a href=\"#footnote2-26-3902\" id=\"note2-26-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">26</a> All of this gives the Hubble an unprecedented view of the universe, allowing it to spend the last 25 years sending us the most astounding photographs of things I can’t really believe are real. Like this epic galaxy:<a href=\"#footnote2-27-3902\" id=\"note2-27-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">27</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/03-hats-off-890.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3937 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/03-hats-off-890.jpg\" alt=\"03-hats-off-890\" width=\"594\" height=\"287\" /></a></p><p>Or these two galaxies, which are in the slow process of merging:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/54916fb9-02f7-4b8c-98df-def86bad895d-2016x2040.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3936 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/54916fb9-02f7-4b8c-98df-def86bad895d-2016x2040.jpeg\" alt=\"54916fb9-02f7-4b8c-98df-def86bad895d-2016x2040\" width=\"426\" height=\"431\" /></a></p><p>Or the inconceivably huge Pillars of Creation (the left finger is so big, at four light years from top to bottom, that if you started at the knuckle and flew in an airplane upwards, it would take 4.5 <em>million</em> years to get to the fingertip):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/c47a074d-e53f-4856-83da-b7b8a928c156-1489x2040.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3935 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/c47a074d-e53f-4856-83da-b7b8a928c156-1489x2040.jpeg\" alt=\"c47a074d-e53f-4856-83da-b7b8a928c156-1489x2040\" width=\"330\" height=\"452\" /></a></p><p>Or the time Hubble aimed its lens at a tiny, seemingly empty square of the sky (seen here next to the moon to show the size of the square):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HDF.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3934 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HDF.jpg\" alt=\"HDF\" width=\"196\" height=\"200\" /></a></p><p>And found thousands of galaxies:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/690958main_p1237a1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3933 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/690958main_p1237a1.jpg\" alt=\"690958main_p1237a1\" width=\"551\" height=\"480\" /></a></p><p>What Hubble and other space telescopes<a href=\"#footnote-13-3902\" id=\"note-13-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a> have shown us has revealed worlds of new information about where we are and how we got here, expanding our knowledge about everything from dark energy to the origin and age and size of the universe to the number of planets out there like ours that might have life on them.</p><p>For over 40 years now, those two objectives—supporting Earth industries and continuing to learn and discover—have been the extent of our relationship with space.</p><p>And because those two goals are both best accomplished by <em>machine </em>space travelers, the most recent chapter of The Story of Humans and Space has been all about space faring machines, with the human role taking place on or very near Earth, controlling things with joysticks.</p><p>The only reason any humans have gone to space since Apollo 17 returned to Earth in 1972 is that sometimes, the machines aren’t yet advanced enough to do a certain task, so we need to send a human up to do it instead. Of the roughly 550 people who have ever been in space, over 400 of them have gone there in the post-Space Race era.

So I went. The conference was run by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (<a href=\"http://www.iss-casis.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CASIS</a>), which manages the US portion of the ISS. Here’s what I learned at the conference:</p><ul><li>The ISS is a science laboratory. It’s kind of like other labs, except with the party trick that it’s soaring through space, so it’s the one lab where you can test things in zero gravity (it’s not actually zero gravity—it’s <em>micro</em>gravity<em>—</em>something I’ll explain later in the post).</li></ul><ul><li>What most <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/casis_spacex4\" target=\"_blank\">ISS experiments</a> have in common is that they’re there for the gravity situation, but beyond that, they span a wide range of purposes—everything from learning about osteoporosis as astronauts’ bones atrophy (because they don’t have to fight against gravity), to testing how equipment holds up in space, to analyzing how fluids behave and interact without the influence of any other forces, to using the change in gravity to trick bacteria into revealing which genes make them immune to certain medicines.</li></ul><ul><li>Astronauts in the ISS have a tight and controlled schedule during the week. At all times, they’re either sleeping (8.5 hours), eating (1.5 hours for breakfast/dinner, 1 hour for lunch) exercising (mandatory 2.5 hours a day), or working on experiments (9 hours a day)—I took <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7334s.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this photo</a> of the current schedule of the three astronauts on the ISS.<a href=\"#footnote-16-3902\" id=\"note-16-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> Weekends are off, which could not possibly sound more fun—you get to spend the whole time floating around and looking out the window.</li></ul><ul><li>I’m not the only one who badly wants to play on the ISS—there’s a furiously competitive process to be selected by NASA to go. Thousands apply, 100 are picked for a final round interview and physical examination, and only one or two end up getting the nod. On rare occasion, a private company or individual can buy a spot on the station for a few days, but it costs around $60 million.</li></ul><p>If you want to get a better feel for what it’s like to live on the ISS, here’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doN4t5NKW-k\" target=\"_blank\">video tour</a> of the space station by a floaty astronaut.</p></div><p>So far, 216 people have gotten to play on the ISS, from 15 countries:<a href=\"#footnote2-30-3902\" id=\"note2-30-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">30</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iss_visitors_country.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4267\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iss_visitors_country.png\" alt=\"iss_visitors_country\" width=\"750\" height=\"357\" /></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">How Stuff Gets to Space</span><br /></strong></span></p><p>We’ve gone over what’s in space, but how does all that stuff <em>get </em>to space?

If a satellite goes up into space, it’s because someone paid one of those ten entities to bring it there atop a massive, expensive rocket (or because a country is putting one up there for its own uses).</p><p>As for launching <em>humans </em>into space, only three countries in history have done it—Russia, the US, and China (who is a fast-growing newcomer to the space industry). Since the 60s, Russia has used its Soyuz rockets to launch people into space, and the US, after wrapping up the Apollo program in 1972, regained the ability to put people in orbit in 1981 with the Space Shuttle program.<a href=\"#footnote2-31-3902\" id=\"note2-31-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">31</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6938210-space-shuttle-photos.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3944\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6938210-space-shuttle-photos.jpg\" alt=\"SPACE-SHUTTLE/\" width=\"488\" height=\"305\" /></a></p><p>Over the next 30 years, the US launched 135 Space Shuttles into LEO, with 133 successes. The two exceptions are fairly traumatizing parts of American history—<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTrmJtHLFU\" target=\"_blank\">Challenger</a> </em>in 1986 and <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIJiW8d_c68\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia</a> </i>in 2003.</p><p>The Space Shuttle Program retired in 2011. Today, only two countries can launch a human into orbit—Russia and China. With no capability themselves, the US—the country that once triumphantly put a man on the moon while the world watched—now has to launch their astronauts on Russian rockets, at Russia’s whim.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>So what are we to make of The Story of Humans and Space? It’s a bit of an odd tale. In 1970, the story looked like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4136\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph1.png\" alt=\"graph1\" width=\"393\" height=\"295\" /></a></p><p>So the assumption about where the story was headed was this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4137\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph2.png\" alt=\"graph2\" width=\"390\" height=\"294\" /></a></p><p>But now it’s 2015, and it turns out that this is what was happening:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph3.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4138\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph3.png\" alt=\"graph3\" width=\"390\" height=\"275\" /></a></p><p>When I look at what’s going on with humans and space today, I should think it’s incredible. Just 58 years after the Soviets put the first man-made object into orbit, we now have a swarm of high-tech equipment soaring around our planet, giving humans magical capabilities in vision and communication. There’s a team of flying robot messengers spread out through the Solar System, reporting back to us with their findings. There’s a <em>huge flying telescope </em>high above Earth, showing us exactly what the observable universe looks like. There’s a football field-sized <i>science lab </i>250 miles above our heads with <em>people </em>in it.</p><p>Everything I just said is <em>amazing</em>.</p><p>And if only The Story of Humans and Space looked like this—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4139\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph4.png\" alt=\"graph4\" width=\"390\" height=\"275\" /></a></p><p>—I would be <em>marveling </em>at the things we’re currently doing out in The Situation.</p><p>But unfortunately, the 60s happened.

If you can’t continue to stay a step ahead of the increasingly-jaded crowd, they’ll quickly tune you out.</p><p>In some areas, the Humans and Space magic show has continued steadily upward. In our quest for knowledge and understanding, for example, we continue to outdo ourselves, learning significantly more about the universe every decade. The human spirit of <em>discovery </em>is alive and well, having thrived in space in the years since Apollo.</p><p>But as fascinated as we are by discovery—as much as we yearn to know all the secrets hidden in the pages of <em>Where Are We?—</em>when it comes to filling us with true excitement and inspiration and getting our <em>adrenaline </em>pumping, discovery doesn’t hold a candle to <em>adventure. </em>Probes and telescopes may fill us with wonder and light up our curiosity, but nothing gets us in our <em>animal core</em> like watching our species go <em>where no man has gone before. </em>And in that arena, the last four decades have left us feeling empty. After watching people land on the moon, following manned missions to and from the ISS is, as Ross Andersen <a href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, “about as thrilling as watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.”</p><p>And that’s why, in today’s world, The Story of Humans and Space has drifted off the front page of our consciousness. The topic that should drop all of us to our knees has become a geeky sideshow. Ask 10 well-educated people you know about what’s going on with Solar System probes or the ISS or NASA or SpaceX and most won’t be able to tell you very much. Some won’t even know that people ever go to space anymore. People don’t know because people don’t care. Because of the way it played out, The Story of Humans and Space feels like a disappointment. And looking at the world around us today, it’s intuitive to predict that future chapters of the space story will continue to putter along as they do today:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph52.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4271\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph52.png\" alt=\"graph5\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" /></a></p><p>Many people don’t think this is a bad thing. “Why spend exorbitant amounts of money sending people to the far reaches of space when we have so many problems right here on Earth?” they ask. Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, who spent three decades playing a key role in US budget decision-making, calls ambitious manned space travel “at best a luxury that the country ought not to be indulging in” and “a complete and total waste of money” and “pure boondoggle.”<a href=\"#footnote2-32-3902\" id=\"note2-32-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a> And the dramatic slashes to NASA’s budget since the Space Race ended suggest that Frank isn’t the only US politician to hold this view.</p><p>Upon first assessment, Frank is being perfectly rational—after all, in the face of concerns like healthcare, national security, education, and poverty, should we really make room for an “adventure budget”? And in that light, the graph projection above for The Future of Humans and Space seems all the more likely to continue on its current course.</p><p>I’ve spent the last couple months reading, talking, and thinking almost non-stop about what the coming chapters of this story will look like—and my assumptions about the future have now changed dramatically.</p><p>I think we’re all in for a big surprise.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 28px;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/2\">Part 2: Musk’s Mission →</a></span></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>For those new to Wait But Why, blue circle footnotes (like this one) are good to click on—they’re for fun facts, extra thoughts, extraneous quotes from my conversations with Musk, and further explanation.<a href=\"#note-1-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-2-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>It was actually the Germans who had the world’s early lead in rocket technology, but when they lost the war, the Americans, Soviets, and British pillaged Germany’s rocket engineers, with each successfully recruiting a number of them.

If it were alone out there, that would be one thing, but if none of the huge dwarf planets in the asteroid or Kuiper belts were planets (including Pluto’s newly-discovered and almost-as-large neighbor, Eris), then there was no good reason Pluto should randomly be one. So the dramatically nerdy International Astronomical Union got together and, amidst tantrums on both sides, settled on an official definition for a planet: 1) Had to orbit the sun, 2) Had to be big enough to become spherical-ish under its own gravity, 3) Had to have cleared out its own orbit. Pluto failed on #3, since there are many other objects in its orbit, which is part of the Kuiper belt. One other fun fact while we’re here: after Uranus was discovered and named, chemists soon after named a newly-invented element after it—uranium. They did the same thing with neptunian (apparently there’s a neptunium) after Neptune was named, and the newly-named Pluto turned into the naming of the element plutonium.<a href=\"#note-9-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-10-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>An AU is an “astronomical unit”—the distance from the Earth to the sun—which is about 93 million miles (150 million km).<a href=\"#note-10-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-11-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>To get a feel for the size of Ceres and Vesta, <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/4_Vesta_1_Ceres_Moon_at_20_km_per_px.png\" target=\"_blank\">here’s</a> what they’d look like next to our moon.<a href=\"#note-11-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-12-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Awkwardly, after almost 20 years of battling for a Hubble budget and creating the telescope, and after finally having launched a risky and difficult Space Shuttle mission to put it into orbit, NASA received the first Hubble photos, only to find that they were <em>blurry.</em> Turns out the mirror curvature was off by 2.2 thousandth of a millimeter. An almost imperceptible error, but with the vast distances the telescope needed to take in, it was enough to ruin everything. It wasn’t until almost four years later that another Space Shuttle mission was able to get back to the telescope to make a fix. The fix had to be worked out perfectly on Earth first, and the astronauts had to implement it perfectly in space—the mirror shape is so precise that if an astronaut even brushed up against it by accident during the repair process, it would ruin it.

When I started, I never intended for it to become such an ordeal. But like the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla post</a>, I decided as I researched that this was A) a supremely important topic that will only become more important in the years to come, and B) something most people don&#8217;t know nearly enough about. My weeks of research and discussions with Musk and others built me an in-depth, tree-trunk understanding of what&#8217;s happening in what I&#8217;m calling The Story of Humans and Space—one that has totally reframed my mental picture of the future (yet again). And as I planned out what to include in the post, I wanted to make sure every Wait But Why reader ended up with the same foundation moving forward—because with everything that&#8217;s coming, we&#8217;re gonna need it. So like the Tesla post, this post became a full situation. Even the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/07/the-spacex-post-progress-meter.html\" target=\"_blank\">progress updates</a> leading up to its publication became a full situation.</p><p>Thanks for your patience. I know you&#8217;d prefer this not to be a site that updates every two months, and I would too. The Tesla and SpaceX posts were special cases, and you can expect a return to more normal-length WBW posts now that they&#8217;re done.</p><p>About the post itself: There are three main parts. Part 1 provides the context and background, Part 2 explores the &#8220;Why&#8221; part of colonizing Mars, and Part 3 digs into the &#8220;How.&#8221; To make reading this post as accessible as possible, it&#8217;s broken into five pages, each about the length of a normal WBW post, and you can jump to any part of the post easily by clicking the links in the Table of Contents below. We&#8217;re also trying two new things, both coming in the next couple days:</p><p><strong>1) <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/spacex-post-pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A PDF</a>: </strong> We&#8217;ve had a lot of requests for a PDF version of the longer posts, and since this is the longest post in written history, we thought it would be a good time to give it a try. All the post&#8217;s footnotes are displayed in the margins, so you won&#8217;t lose those, and when read on a screen, the PDF will have working hyperlinks as well.</p><p><strong>There are two versions of the PDF: Normal and G-Rated. </strong>The G-Rated version is totally clean an appropriate for all ages.</p><p>The PDF costs $3 (which covers with both versions).

All those things she had always heard about—buildings that were constructed hundreds of years before the first human set foot on Ganymede; animals the size of a house; oceans the size of her whole world; tropical beaches; the famous blue sky; the giant sun that&#8217;s so close it can burn your skin; and the weirdest part—<em>no Jupiter hovering overhead</em>. Having seen it all in so many movies, she felt like she was going to visit a legendary movie set. It was too much to think about all at once. For now, she just had to focus on making sure she had everything she needed and saying goodbye to everyone—it would be a long time before she would see them again&#8230;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a>Part 1: The Story of Humans and Space</strong></span></p><p>About six million years ago, a very important female great ape had two children. One of her children would go on to become the common ancestor of all chimpanzees. The other would give birth to a line that would one day include the entire human race. While the descendants of her first child would end up being pretty normal and monkey-ish, as time passed, strange things began to happen with the lineage of the other.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3902\" id=\"note-1-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3902\" id=\"note2-1-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> <strong><sup><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">←</span> click these</sup></strong></p><p>We&#8217;re not quite sure why, but over the next six million years, our ancestral line started to do something no creatures on Earth had ever done before—they woke up.</p><p>It happened slowly and gradually through the thousands of generations the same way your brain slowly comes to in the first few seconds after you rouse from sleep. But as the clarity increased, our ancestors started to look around and, for the very first time, <em>wonder</em>.</p><p>Emerging from a 3.6-billion-year dream, life on Earth had its first questions.</p><p><em>What is this big room we&#8217;re in, and who put us here? What is that bright yellow circle on the ceiling and where does it go every night? Where does the ocean end and what happens when you get there? Where are all the dead people now that they&#8217;re not here anymore? </em></p><p>We had discovered our species&#8217; great mystery novel—<em>Where Are We?</em>—and we wanted to learn how to read it.</p><p>As the light of human consciousness grew brighter and brighter, we began to arrive at answers that seemed to make sense. Maybe we were on top of a floating disk, and maybe that disk was on top of a huge turtle. Maybe the pinpricks of light above us at night are a glimpse into what lies beyond this big room—and maybe that&#8217;s where we go when we die. Maybe if we can find the place where the ceiling meets the floor, we can poke our heads through and see all the super fun stuff on the other side.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3902\" id=\"note2-2-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flammarion1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4088\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Flammarion1.jpg\" alt=\"Flammarion\" width=\"527\" height=\"439\" /></a></p><p>Around 10,000 years ago, isolated tribes of humans began to merge together and form the first cities. In larger communities, people were able to talk to each other about this mystery novel we had found, comparing notes across tribes and through the generations. As the techniques for learning became more sophisticated and the clues piled up, new discoveries surfaced.</p><p>The world was apparently a ball, not a disk. Which meant that the ceiling was actually a larger sphere surrounding us. The sizes of the other objects floating out there in the sphere with us, and the distances between them, were vaster than we had ever imagined. And then, something upsetting:</p><p>The sun wasn&#8217;t revolving around us. We were revolving around the sun.</p><p>This was a <em>super </em>unwarm, unfuzzy discovery. Why the <em>hell</em> weren&#8217;t we in the center of things? What did that mean?</p><p><em>Where are we?</em></p><p>The sphere was already unpleasantly big—if we weren&#8217;t in the center of it, were we just on a random ball inside of it, kind of for no apparent reason? Could this really be what was happening?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Earth.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4163\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Earth.png\" alt=\"Tiny Earth\" width=\"629\" height=\"362\" /></a></p><p>Scary.</p><p>Then things got worse.</p><p>It seemed that the pinpricks of light on the edge of the sphere weren&#8217;t what we thought they were—they were other suns like ours. And they were out there floating just like our sun—which means <em>we weren&#8217;t inside of a sphere at all</em>. Not only was our planet not the center of things, even our <em>sun </em>was just a random dude out there, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothingness.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Sun.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4164\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tiny-Sun.png\" alt=\"Tiny Sun\" width=\"650\" height=\"374\" /></a></p><p><em>Scary.</em></p><p>Our sun turned out to be a little piece of something much bigger. A beautiful, vast cloud of billions of suns.

Until we realized that it wasn&#8217;t everything, it was this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Milky-Way-small.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4122\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Milky-Way-small.jpg\" alt=\"Milky Way small\" width=\"600\" height=\"345\" /></a></p><p>Darkness.</p><p>The better our tools and understanding became, the more we could zoom out, and the more we zoomed out, the more things sucked. We were deciphering the pages of <em>Where Are We?</em> at our own peril, and we had deciphered our way right into the knowledge that we&#8217;re unbelievably alone, living on a lonely island inside a lonely island inside a lonely island, buried in layers of isolation, with no one to talk to.</p><p>That&#8217;s our situation.</p><p>In the most recent 1% of our species&#8217; short existence, we have become the first life on Earth to know about the Situation—and we&#8217;ve been having a collective existential crisis ever since.</p><p>You really can&#8217;t blame us. Imagine not realizing that the universe is a thing and <em>then realizing the universe is a thing</em>. It&#8217;s a <em>lot </em>to take in.</p><p>Most of us handle it by living in a pleasant delusion, pretending that the only place we live is in an endless land of colors and warmth. We&#8217;re like this guy, who&#8217;s doing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bWyhj7siEY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13s\" target=\"_blank\">everything he possibly can</a> to ignore the Situation:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3902\" id=\"note2-3-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/zipgif1.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-4235 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/zipgif1.gif\" alt=\"zipgif1\" width=\"350\" height=\"262\" /></a></p><p>And our best friend for this activity? The clear blue sky. The blue sky seems like it was <em>invented </em>to help humans pretend the Situation doesn&#8217;t exist, serving as the perfect whimsical backdrop to shield us from reality.</p><p>Then nighttime happens, and there&#8217;s the Situation, staring us right in the face.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Stars.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-4241 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Stars.jpg\" alt=\"Stars\" width=\"606\" height=\"401\" /></a></p><p><i>Oh yeah&#8230;</i></p><p>This la-di-da  →  oh yeah&#8230;  →  la-di-da  →  oh yeah&#8230; merry-go-round of psychosis was, for most of recent history, the extent of our relationship with the Situation.</p><p>But in the last 60 years, that relationship has vaulted to a whole new level. During World War II, missile technology leapt forward,<a href=\"#footnote-2-3902\" id=\"note-2-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> and for the first time, a new, mind-blowing concept was possible—</p><p><em>Space travel.</em></p><p>For thousands of years, The Story of Humans and Space had been the story of staring out and wondering. The possibility of people leaving our Earth island and <em>venturing out</em><em>into space</em> burst open the human spirit of adventure.</p><p>I imagine a similar feeling in the people of the 15th century, during the Age of Discovery, when we were working our way through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cantino_planisphere_(1502).jpg\" target=\"_blank\">world map chapter</a> of <em>Where Are We?</em> and the notion of cross-ocean voyages dazzled people&#8217;s imaginations. If you asked a child in 1495 what they wanted to be when they grew up, &#8220;an ocean explorer&#8221; would probably have been a common response.</p><p>In 1970, if you asked a child the same question, the answer would be, &#8220;an astronaut&#8221;—i.e. <em>a Situation explorer</em>.</p><p>WWII advanced the possibility of human space travel, but it was in late 1957, when the Soviets launched the first man-made object into orbit, the adorable <a href=\"http://www.bisbos.com/images_spacecraft/sputnik_1_800.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Sputnik 1</a>, that space travel became <em>the </em>defining quest of the world&#8217;s great powers.</p><p>At the time, the Cold War was in full throttle, and the US and Soviets had their measuring sticks out for an internationally-televised penis-measuring contest. With the successful launch of Sputnik, the Soviet penis bolted out by a few centimeters, horrifying the Americans.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4126\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest1.png\" alt=\"Contest1\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" /></a></p><p>To the Soviets, putting a satellite into space before the US was proof that Soviet technology was superior to American technology, which in turn was put forward as proof, for all the world to see, that communism was a system superior to capitalism.</p><p>Eight months later, NASA was born.</p><p>The Space Race had begun, and NASA&#8217;s first order of business would be to get a man into space, and then a man into full orbit, preferably both before the Soviets. The US was not to be shown up again.</p><p>In 1959, NASA launched Project Mercury to carry out the mission. They were on the verge of success when in April of 1961, the Soviets launched Yuri Gagarin into a full orbit around the Earth, making the first human in space <em>and</em> in orbit a Soviet.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4127\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Contest2.png\" alt=\"Contest2\" width=\"500\" height=\"315\" /></a></p><p>It was time for drastic measures. John F. Kennedy&#8217;s advisors <a href=\"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/apollo2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">told him</a> that the Soviets had too big a lead for the US to beat them at any near-term achievements—but that the prospect of a manned <em>moon</em> landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to get <em>there</em> first. So Kennedy gave his famous &#8220;we choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hahhd&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25G1M4EXrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m32s\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a>, and directed an outrageous amount of funding at the mission ($20 billion, or $205 billion in today&#8217;s dollars).</p><p>The result was Project Apollo. Apollo&#8217;s mission was to land an American on the moon—and to do it <em>first</em>. The Soviets answered with Soyuz, their own moon program, and the race was on.</p><p>As the early phases of Apollo started coming together, Project Mercury finally hit its stride. Just a month after Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, American astronaut Alan Shepard became the second man in space, completing a <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Freedom_7_Diagram.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">little arc</a> that didn&#8217;t put him in full orbit but allowed him to give space a high-five at the top of the arc. A few months later, in February of 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.</p><p>The next seven years saw 22 US and Soviet manned launches as the superpowers honed their skills and technology. By late 1968, the furiously-sprinting US had more total launches under their belt (17) than the Soviets (10), and together, the two nations had mastered what we call Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LEO.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4115\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LEO.jpg\" alt=\"LEO\" width=\"653\" height=\"516\" /></a></p><p>But LEO hadn&#8217;t really excited anyone since the early &#8217;60s. Both powers had their sights firmly set on the moon. The Apollo program was making quick leaps, and in December of 1968, the US became the first nation to soar outside of LEO. Apollo 8 made it all the way to the moon&#8217;s orbit and circled around 10 times before returning home safely. The crew, which included James Lovell (who a few months later played the role of Tom Hanks on the Apollo 13 mission), shattered the human altitude record and became the first people to see the moon up close, the first to see the &#8220;dark&#8221; side of the moon, and the first to see the Earth as a whole planet, snapping this iconic photo:<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3902\" id=\"note2-4-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3919 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg\" alt=\"1280px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise\" width=\"340\" height=\"340\" /></a></p><p>Upon return, the crew became America&#8217;s most celebrated heroes—which I hope they enjoyed for eight months. Three Apollo missions later, in July of 1969, Apollo 11 made Americans Neil Armstrong<a href=\"#footnote-3-3902\" id=\"note-3-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> and Buzz Aldrin the first humans on the moon, and Armstrong took this famous photo of Aldrin looking all puffy:<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3902\" id=\"note2-5-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3920\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aldrin_Apollo_11.jpg\" alt=\"Aldrin_Apollo_11\" width=\"356\" height=\"356\" /></a></p><p>It&#8217;s hard to fully emphasize what a big deal this was. Ever since life on Earth began 3.6 billion years ago, no earthly creature had set foot on any celestial body other than the Earth. Suddenly, there are Armstrong and Aldrin, bouncing around <em>another </em>sphere, looking up in the sky where the moon is supposed to be and seeing the Earth instead. Insane.</p><p>Project Apollo proved to be a smashing success. Not only did Apollo get a man on the moon before the Soviets, the program sent 10 more men to the moon over the next 3.5 years on five other Apollo missions. There were six successful moon trips in seven tries, with the famous exception being Apollo 13, which was safely aborted after an explosion in the oxygen tank.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3902\" id=\"note-4-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p>The Soviet Soyuz program kept running into technical problems, and it never ended up putting someone on the moon.</p><p>The final Apollo moonwalk took place in late 1972. In only one decade, we had conquered nearby space, and progress was accelerating. If at that time you had asked any American, or any other human, what the coming decades of space travel would bring, they&#8217;d have made big, bold predictions. Many more people on the moon, a permanent moon base, people on Mars, and beyond.</p><p>So you can only imagine how surprised they&#8217;d be if you told them in 1972, after just watching 12 humans walk on the moon, that 43 years later, in the impossibly futuristic-sounding year 2015, the number of people to set foot on the moon <em>would still be 12</em>. Or that after leaving Low Earth Orbit in the dust years earlier and using it now as our pre-moon trip parking lot, 2015 would roll around and LEO would be the farthest out humans would ever go.</p><p>1972 people would be blown away by our smart phones and our internet, but they&#8217;d be just as shocked that we gave up on pushing our boundaries in space.</p><p>So what happened? After such a wildly exciting decade of human space adventure, why did we just <em>stop?</em></p><p>Well, like we found in the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla post</a>, &#8220;Why did we stop?&#8221; is the wrong question. Instead, we should ask:</p><p><em>Why were we ever adventurous about sending humans into space in the first place?</em></p><p>Space travel is unbelievably expensive. National budgets are incredibly tight. The fact is, it&#8217;s kind of surprising that a nation <em>ever</em> ponied up a sizable chunk of its budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries.</p><p>And that&#8217;s actually because no nation <em>did </em>blow their budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries—two nations blew their budgets because of a <em>penis</em>&#8211;<em>length</em> contest. In the face of international embarrassment at a time when everyone was trying to figure out whose economic system was better, the US government agreed to drop the usual rules for a few years to pour whatever resources were necessary on the problem to make sure they won that argument—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Early-budget.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4129\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Early-budget.png\" alt=\"Early budget\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" /></a></p><p>And once they won it, the contest was over and so were the special rules.

It&#8217;s about using space for practical purposes in support of industries on Earth—mostly in the form of satellites. The bulk of today&#8217;s rocket launches into space are simply putting things into LEO whose purpose is to look back down at Earth, not to the great expanses in the other direction.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a little satellite overview:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Satellites Blue Box</strong></span></p><p>We don&#8217;t think about them that often, but above us are hundreds of flying robots that play a large part in our lives on Earth. In 1957, lonely Sputnik circled the Earth by itself, but today, the worlds of communication, weather forecasting, television, navigation, and aerial photography all rely heavily on satellites, as do many national militaries and government intelligence agencies.</p><p>The total market for satellite manufacturing, the launches that carry them to space, and related equipment and services has ballooned from $60 billion in 2004 to over $200 billion in 2015. Satellite industry revenue today makes up only 4% of the global telecommunications industry but accounts for over 60% of space industry revenue.<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3902\" id=\"note2-7-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Here&#8217;s how the world&#8217;s satellites break down by role (in 2013):<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3902\" id=\"note2-8-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SatFunction1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3928\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SatFunction1.png\" alt=\"SatFunction\" width=\"459\" height=\"417\" /></a></p><p>Of the 1,265 active satellites in orbit at the beginning of 2015, the US owns by far <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/264472/number-of-satellites-in-orbit-by-operating-country/\" target=\"_blank\">the largest number</a> at 528—over 40% of the total—but over 50 countries own at least one orbiting satellite.</p><p>As for <em>where </em>all of these satellites are, most of them fall into two distinct &#8220;layers&#8221; of space:</p><p>About two-thirds of active satellites are in Low Earth Orbit. LEO starts up at 99 miles (160 km) above the Earth, the lowest altitude at which an object can orbit without atmospheric drag messing things up.  The top of LEO is 1,240 miles (2,000 km) up. Typically, the lowest satellites are at around 220 miles (350 km) up or higher.</p><p>Most of the rest (about one-third) of the satellites are much farther out, in a place called geostationary orbit (GEO). It&#8217;s right at 22,236 miles (35,786 km) above the Earth, and it&#8217;s called geostationary because something orbiting in it rotates at the exact speed that the Earth turns, making its position in the sky stationary relative to a point on the Earth. It&#8217;ll seem to be motionless to an observer on the ground.<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3902\" id=\"note2-9-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geostationaryjava3D.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3924 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Geostationaryjava3D.gif\" alt=\"Geostationaryjava3D\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p>GEO is ideal for something like a TV satellite because a dish on the Earth can aim at the same fixed spot all the time.</p><p>A small percentage of other satellites are in medium Earth orbit (MEO), which is everything in between LEO and GEO. One notable resident of MEO is the GPS system that most Americans, and people from many other countries, use every day. I never realized that the entire GPS system, a US Department of Defense project that went live in 1995, only uses 32 satellites total. And until 2012, the number was only 24—six orbits, each with four satellites. But you can see in the GIF below that even with 24, a given point on the Earth can be seen by at least six of the satellites at any given time, and usually it&#8217;s nine or higher (in the GIF, the blue dot on the Earth is a hypothetical person on the ground, and whichever satellites can see him at a given time are blue, with the green lines showing their line of sight to the person):<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3902\" id=\"note2-10-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ConstellationGPS.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3925 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ConstellationGPS.gif\" alt=\"ConstellationGPS\" width=\"240\" height=\"192\" /></a></p><p>This is why your phone&#8217;s map can still show your location even when you&#8217;re somewhere with no cellular service—because it has nothing to do with cellular service. The system is also set up to be redundant—only four satellites need to simultaneously see you in order for the system to pinpoint your location. GPS satellites have an orbital period of about 12 hours, making two full rotations of the Earth each day.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3902\" id=\"note-5-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p>You can see satellite locations using <a href=\"http://www.gearthblog.com/satellites\" target=\"_blank\">Google Earth</a> (here&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydbbd-4oEds\" target=\"_blank\">cool video</a> of Google Earth showing the satellites).</p><div class=\"wbwAside2\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><b>Space Debris Bluer Box</b></span></p><p>There&#8217;s a big problem happening in the world of satellites. In addition to the 1,265 active satellites up in orbit, there are thousands more inactive satellites, as well as a bunch of spent rockets from previous missions. And once in a while, one of them explodes, or two of them collide, creating a ton of tiny fragments called space debris. The number of objects in space has risen quickly over recent decades, as a GIF<a href=\"#footnote-6-3902\" id=\"note-6-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> made by the ESA shows (with exaggerated-sized objects relative to the Earth&#8217;s size):<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3902\" id=\"note2-11-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\" wp-image-3931 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb.gif\" alt=\"2599e0ad79e09729f1ef751b422dccfb\" width=\"675\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>The majority of satellites and debris are bunched around the Earth in LEO, and the outer ring of objects is what&#8217;s located in GEO.</p><p>Earth space agencies track about 17,000 objects in space, only 7% of which are active satellites.

There are two high-tech ways modern astronomers see things:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Looking and Learning Tool #1: Sending probes around the Solar System</strong></span></p><p>Basically, scientists fire a fancy robot toward some distant planet, moon, or asteroid, and the robot spends months or years flying through space, bored, until it finally arrives. Then, depending on the plan, it either just flies by the object, taking some pictures on the way, orbits the object to get more detailed information, or lands on the object for a full inspection. Everything it learns, it sends back to us, and one day, when its job is done, we either kill the probe by crashing it into the object or let it just fly out into deep space to be depressed.</p><p>I often use myself as a litmus test for what the public probably knows about or doesn&#8217;t know about. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before on this blog, I&#8217;ve been seriously dating astronomy ever since I was three years old—so if I don&#8217;t know something going on in the world of space, I assume that most people don&#8217;t. And when it comes to space probes, I&#8217;ve felt pretty disoriented. Are there 200 of them flying around out there? 50? 9? Why are they out there, who sent them, and what are they doing? All I&#8217;d know is that sometimes there would be a random story about some probe sending back stunning pictures—I&#8217;d open the cnn.com gallery, click through them, be thrilled for a second, send the link to the three friends of mine who are also dating astronomy, and then try to close the page but instead see some trashy CNN clickbait headline on the side of the page, click that, and ruin my life for the next three hateful hours. That&#8217;s my relationship with humanity&#8217;s space probes.</p><p>But in researching this post, I quickly realized there&#8217;s not that much to know, and it doesn&#8217;t take too big an effort to get fully oriented.

So I went. The conference was run by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (<a href=\"http://www.iss-casis.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CASIS</a>), which manages the US portion of the ISS.

At all times, they&#8217;re either sleeping (8.5 hours), eating (1.5 hours for breakfast/dinner, 1 hour for lunch) exercising (mandatory 2.5 hours a day), or working on experiments (9 hours a day)—I took <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_7334s.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">this photo</a> of the current schedule of the three astronauts on the ISS.<a href=\"#footnote-16-3902\" id=\"note-16-3902\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> Weekends are off, which could not possibly sound more fun—you get to spend the whole time floating around and looking out the window.</li></ul><ul><li>I&#8217;m not the only one who badly wants to play on the ISS—there&#8217;s a furiously competitive process to be selected by NASA to go. Thousands apply, 100 are picked for a final round interview and physical examination, and only one or two end up getting the nod.

The answer is that there are nine countries that have the ability to launch something into orbit: Russia, the US, France, Japan, China, India, Israel, Iran and, um, North Korea—along with one non-national entity, the European Space Agency (ESA). If a satellite goes up into space, it&#8217;s because someone paid one of those ten entities to bring it there atop a massive, expensive rocket (or because a country is putting one up there for its own uses).</p><p>As for launching <em>humans </em>into space, only three countries in history have done it—Russia, the US, and China (who is a fast-growing newcomer to the space industry). Since the 60s, Russia has used its Soyuz rockets to launch people into space, and the US, after wrapping up the Apollo program in 1972, regained the ability to put people in orbit in 1981 with the Space Shuttle program.<a href=\"#footnote2-31-3902\" id=\"note2-31-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">31</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6938210-space-shuttle-photos.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3944\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6938210-space-shuttle-photos.jpg\" alt=\"SPACE-SHUTTLE/\" width=\"488\" height=\"305\" /></a></p><p>Over the next 30 years, the US launched 135 Space Shuttles into LEO, with 133 successes. The two exceptions are fairly traumatizing parts of American history—<em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTrmJtHLFU\" target=\"_blank\">Challenger</a> </em>in 1986 and <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIJiW8d_c68\" target=\"_blank\">Columbia</a> </i>in 2003.</p><p>The Space Shuttle Program retired in 2011. Today, only two countries can launch a human into orbit—Russia and China. With no capability themselves, the US—the country that once triumphantly put a man on the moon while the world watched—now has to launch their astronauts on Russian rockets, at Russia&#8217;s whim.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>So what are we to make of The Story of Humans and Space? It&#8217;s a bit of an odd tale. In 1970, the story looked like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4136\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph1.png\" alt=\"graph1\" width=\"393\" height=\"295\" /></a></p><p>So the assumption about where the story was headed was this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph2.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4137\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph2.png\" alt=\"graph2\" width=\"390\" height=\"294\" /></a></p><p>But now it&#8217;s 2015, and it turns out that this is what was happening:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph3.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4138\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph3.png\" alt=\"graph3\" width=\"390\" height=\"275\" /></a></p><p>When I look at what&#8217;s going on with humans and space today, I should think it&#8217;s incredible. Just 58 years after the Soviets put the first man-made object into orbit, we now have a swarm of high-tech equipment soaring around our planet, giving humans magical capabilities in vision and communication. There&#8217;s a team of flying robot messengers spread out through the Solar System, reporting back to us with their findings. There&#8217;s a <em>huge flying telescope </em>high above Earth, showing us exactly what the observable universe looks like. There&#8217;s a football field-sized <i>science lab </i>250 miles above our heads with <em>people </em>in it.</p><p>Everything I just said is <em>amazing</em>.</p><p>And if only The Story of Humans and Space looked like this—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4139\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph4.png\" alt=\"graph4\" width=\"390\" height=\"275\" /></a></p><p>—I would be <em>marveling </em>at the things we&#8217;re currently doing out in The Situation.</p><p>But unfortunately, the 60s happened.

If you can&#8217;t continue to stay a step ahead of the increasingly-jaded crowd, they&#8217;ll quickly tune you out.</p><p>In some areas, the Humans and Space magic show has continued steadily upward. In our quest for knowledge and understanding, for example, we continue to outdo ourselves, learning significantly more about the universe every decade. The human spirit of <em>discovery </em>is alive and well, having thrived in space in the years since Apollo.</p><p>But as fascinated as we are by discovery—as much as we yearn to know all the secrets hidden in the pages of <em>Where Are We?—</em>when it comes to filling us with true excitement and inspiration and getting our <em>adrenaline </em>pumping, discovery doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to <em>adventure. </em>Probes and telescopes may fill us with wonder and light up our curiosity, but nothing gets us in our <em>animal core</em> like watching our species go <em>where no man has gone before. </em>And in that arena, the last four decades have left us feeling empty. After watching people land on the moon, following manned missions to and from the ISS is, as Ross Andersen <a href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/the-elon-musk-interview-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, &#8220;about as thrilling as watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.&#8221;</p><p>And that&#8217;s why, in today&#8217;s world, The Story of Humans and Space has drifted off the front page of our consciousness. The topic that should drop all of us to our knees has become a geeky sideshow. Ask 10 well-educated people you know about what&#8217;s going on with Solar System probes or the ISS or NASA or SpaceX and most won&#8217;t be able to tell you very much. Some won&#8217;t even know that people ever go to space anymore. People don&#8217;t know because people don&#8217;t care. Because of the way it played out, The Story of Humans and Space feels like a disappointment. And looking at the world around us today, it&#8217;s intuitive to predict that future chapters of the space story will continue to putter along as they do today:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph52.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4271\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph52.png\" alt=\"graph5\" width=\"500\" height=\"297\" /></a></p><p>Many people don&#8217;t think this is a bad thing. &#8220;Why spend exorbitant amounts of money sending people to the far reaches of space when we have so many problems right here on Earth?&#8221; they ask. Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, who spent three decades playing a key role in US budget decision-making, calls ambitious manned space travel &#8220;at best a luxury that the country ought not to be indulging in&#8221; and &#8220;a complete and total waste of money&#8221; and &#8220;pure boondoggle.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-32-3902\" id=\"note2-32-3902\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a> And the dramatic slashes to NASA&#8217;s budget since the Space Race ended suggest that Frank isn&#8217;t the only US politician to hold this view.</p><p>Upon first assessment, Frank is being perfectly rational—after all, in the face of concerns like healthcare, national security, education, and poverty, should we really make room for an &#8220;adventure budget&#8221;?

If it were alone out there, that would be one thing, but if none of the huge dwarf planets in the asteroid or Kuiper belts were planets (including Pluto&#8217;s newly-discovered and almost-as-large neighbor, Eris), then there was no good reason Pluto should randomly be one. So the dramatically nerdy International Astronomical Union got together and, amidst tantrums on both sides, settled on an official definition for a planet: 1) Had to orbit the sun, 2) Had to be big enough to become spherical-ish under its own gravity, 3) Had to have cleared out its own orbit. Pluto failed on #3, since there are many other objects in its orbit, which is part of the Kuiper belt. One other fun fact while we&#8217;re here: after Uranus was discovered and named, chemists soon after named a newly-invented element after it—uranium. They did the same thing with neptunian (apparently there&#8217;s a neptunium) after Neptune was named, and the newly-named Pluto turned into the naming of the element plutonium.<a href=\"#note-9-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-10-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>An AU is an &#8220;astronomical unit&#8221;—the distance from the Earth to the sun—which is about 93 million miles (150 million km).<a href=\"#note-10-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-11-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>To get a feel for the size of Ceres and Vesta, <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/4_Vesta_1_Ceres_Moon_at_20_km_per_px.png\" target=\"_blank\">here&#8217;s</a> what they&#8217;d look like next to our moon.<a href=\"#note-11-3902\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-12-3902\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Awkwardly, after almost 20 years of battling for a Hubble budget and creating the telescope, and after finally having launched a risky and difficult Space Shuttle mission to put it into orbit, NASA received the first Hubble photos, only to find that they were <em>blurry.</em> Turns out the mirror curvature was off by 2.2 thousandth of a millimeter. An almost imperceptible error, but with the vast distances the telescope needed to take in, it was enough to ruin everything. It wasn&#8217;t until almost four years later that another Space Shuttle mission was able to get back to the telescope to make a fix. The fix had to be worked out perfectly on Earth first, and the astronauts had to implement it perfectly in space—the mirror shape is so precise that if an astronaut even brushed up against it by accident during the repair process, it would ruin it.

") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/feed") (slash:comments nil "729"))) ("Why I’m Always Late" "<p>I woke up this morning to a text from Andrew. It was a link:</p><p><a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/\" target=\"_blank\">http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/</a></p><p>“optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late”</p><p>Intriguing. Nothing’s better than the headline, “The reason people are [bad quality that describes you] is actually because they’re [good quality].”</p><p>I got reading. And as it turns out, late people are actually the best people ever.<em> </em>They’re optimistic and hopeful:</p><p><em>“People who are continuously late are actually just more optimistic. They believe they can fit more tasks into a limited amount of time more than other people and thrive when they’re multitasking. Simply put, they’re fundamentally hopeful.”</em></p><p>They’re big-thinking:</p><p><em>“People who are habitually late don’t sweat over the small stuff, they concentrate on the big picture and see the future as full of infinite possibilities.”</em></p><p>Late people just <em>get </em>it:</p><p><em>“People with a tendency for tardiness like to stop and smell the roses…l</em><em>ife was never meant to be planned down to the last detail. Remaining excessively attached to timetables signifies an inability to enjoy the moment.”</em></p><p>By the end of the article, I had never felt prouder to be a chronically late person.</p><p>But also, what the hell is going on? Late people are the <em>worst</em>. It’s the quality I like <em>least </em>in myself. And I’m not late because I like to smell the roses, or because I can see the big picture, or because the future is full of infinite possibilities.</p><p>I’m late because I’m insane.</p><p>So I thought about this for a minute, and I think I figured out what’s going on. The issue is that there are two kinds of lateness:</p><p><strong>1) Okay lateness.</strong> This is when the late person being late does not negatively impact anyone else—like being late to a group hangout or a party. Things can start on time and proceed as normal with or without the late person being there yet.</p><p><strong>2) Not okay lateness. </strong>This is when the late person being late <em>does</em> negatively impact others—like being late to a two-person dinner or meeting or anything else that simply can’t start until the late party arrives.</p><p>Haltiwanger’s article is (I hope) talking mostly about <em>okay </em>lateness. In which case sure, maybe those people are the best, who knows.</p><p>But if you read the comment section under Haltiwanger’s article, people are <em>furious</em> with him for portraying lateness in a positive light. And that’s because <em>they’re </em>thinking about the far less excusable <em>not </em>okay lateness.</p><p>All of this has kind of left me with no choice but to take a quick nine-hour break from working on the gargantuan SpaceX post to discuss <em>not </em>okay late people.</p><p>When it comes to people who are chronically not okay late, I think there are two subgroups:</p><p><strong>Group 1) Those who don’t feel bad or wrong about it. </strong>These people are assholes.</p><p><strong>Group 2) Those who feel terrible and self-loathing about it. </strong>These people have problems.</p><p>Group 1 is simple. They think they’re a little more special than everyone else, like the zero-remorse narcissist <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/\" target=\"_blank\">at the top</a> of Haltiwanger’s article. They’re unappealing. Not much else to discuss here.</p><p>Punctual people think <em>all </em>not okay late people are in Group 1 (as the comments on this post will show)—because they’re assuming all late people are sane people.</p><p>When a sane person thinks a certain kind of behavior is fine, they do it. When they think it’s wrong, they don’t do it. So to a punctual person—one who shows up on time because they believe showing up late is the wrong thing to do—someone who’s chronically late must be an asshole who thinks being late is okay.</p><p>But that’s misunderstanding the entire second group, who, despite being consistently late, usually detest the concept of making other people wait. Let call them CLIPs (Chronically Late Insane Person).</p><p>While both groups of not okay late people end up regularly frustrating others, a reliable way to identify a Group 2 CLIP is a bizarre compulsion to defeat themselves—some deep inner drive to inexplicably miss the beginning of movies, endure psychotic stress running to catch the train, crush their own reputation at work, etc. etc. As much as they may hurt others, they usually hurt themselves even more.</p><p>I come from a long line of CLIPs. I spent around 15% of my youth standing on some sidewalk alone, angrily kicking rocks, because yet <em>again</em>, all the other kids had gotten picked up and I was still waiting for my mom. When she finally arrived, instead of being able to have a pleasant conversation with her, I’d get into the car seething. She always felt terrible. She has problems.</p><p>My sister once missed an early morning flight, so they rescheduled her for the following morning. She managed to miss that one <em>too</em>, so they put her on a flight five hours later. Killing time during the long layover, she got distracted on a long phone call and <em>missed that flight too. </em>She has problems<em>. </em></p><p>I’ve been a CLIP my whole life. I’ve made a bunch of friends mad at me, I’ve embarrassed myself again and again in professional situations, and I’ve run a cumulative marathon through airport terminals. It’s often the same story, something like this:</p><p>I’ll be meeting someone, maybe a professional contact, at, say, a coffee place at 3:00. When I lay out my schedule for the day, I’ll have the perfect plan. I’ll leave early, arrive early, and get there around 2:45. That takes all the stress out of the situation, and that’s ideal because non-stressful commutes are one of my favorite things. It’ll be great—I’ll stroll out, put on a podcast, and head to the subway. Once I’m off the subway, with time to spare, I’ll take a few minutes to peruse storefronts, grab a lemonade from a street vendor, and <em>enjoy New York</em>. It’ll be such a joy to look up at the architecture, listen to the sounds, and feel the swell of people rushing by—oh magnificent city!</p><p>All I have to do is be off the subway by 2:45. To do that, I need to be on the subway by 2:25, so let’s be safe and get to the subway by 2:15. So I have to leave my apartment by 2:07 or earlier, and I’m set. What a plan. Here’s how it’ll play out (if you’re new to WBW, you’re advised to <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">check this out</a> before

I’m sure each CLIP is insane in their own special way, and to understand how they work, you’ll usually have to get to some dark inner psychology. For me, it’s some mix of these three odd traits:</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I’m late because I’m in denial about how time works.</span> </strong>The propensity of CLIPs to underestimate how long things take comes out of some habitual delusional optimism. Usually what happens is, of all the times the CLIP has done a certain activity or commute, what they remember is that one time things went the <em>quickest</em>. And <em>that </em>amount of time is what sticks in their head as how long that thing takes. I don’t think there’s <em>anything </em>that will get me to internalize that packing for a week-long trip takes 20 minutes. In my head, it’s eternally a five-minute task. You just take out the bag, throw some clothes in it, throw your toiletries in, zip it up and done. Five minutes. The empirical data that shows that there are actually a lot of little things to think about when you pack and that it takes 20 minutes every time is irrelevant. Packing is clearly a five-minute task. As I type this, that’s what I believe.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I’m late because I have a weird aversion to changing circumstances.</span> </strong>Not sure what the deal is with this, but something in me is strangely appalled by the idea of transitioning from what I’m currently doing to doing something else. When I’m at home working, I <em>hate </em>when there’s something on my schedule that I have to stop everything for to go outside and do. It’s not that I hate the activity—once I’m there I’m often pleased to be there—it’s an irrational resistance to the <em>transition</em>. The positive side of this is it usually means I’m highly present when I finally do haul my ass somewhere, and I’m often among the last to leave.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Finally, I’m late because I’m mad at myself. </strong></span>There’s a pretty strong correlation here—the worse I feel about my productivity so far that day, the more likely I am to be late. When I’m pleased with how I’ve lived the day so far, the Rational Decision-Maker has a much easier time taking control of the wheel. I feel like an adult, so it’s easy to act like an adult. But times when the monkey had his way with me all day, when the time rolls around that I need to stop working and head out somewhere, I can’t <em>believe</em> that this is <em>all</em> I’ve gotten done. So my brain throws a little tantrum, refusing to accept the regrettable circumstances, and stages a self-flagellating protest, saying, “NO. This can<em>not </em>be the situation. Nope. You didn’t do what you were supposed to do, and now you’ll sit here and get more done, even if it makes you late.”</p><p>So yeah, that’s why I’m late—because I’m insane. Don’t excuse the CLIPs in your life—it’s not okay and they need to fix it—but remember, it’s not about you.

") (content:encoded nil "<p>I woke up this morning to a text from Andrew. It was a link:</p><p><a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/\" target=\"_blank\">http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/</a></p><p>&#8220;optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late&#8221;</p><p>Intriguing. Nothing&#8217;s better than the headline, &#8220;The reason people are [bad quality that describes you] is actually because they&#8217;re [good quality].&#8221;</p><p>I got reading. And as it turns out, late people are actually the best people ever.<em> </em>They&#8217;re optimistic and hopeful:</p><p><em>&#8220;People who are continuously late are actually just more optimistic. They believe they can fit more tasks into a limited amount of time more than other people and thrive when they’re multitasking. Simply put, they’re fundamentally hopeful.&#8221;</em></p><p>They&#8217;re big-thinking:</p><p><em>&#8220;People who are habitually late don’t sweat over the small stuff, they concentrate on the big picture and see the future as full of infinite possibilities.&#8221;</em></p><p>Late people just <em>get </em>it:</p><p><em>&#8220;People with a tendency for tardiness like to stop and smell the roses&#8230;l</em><em>ife was never meant to be planned down to the last detail. Remaining excessively attached to timetables signifies an inability to enjoy the moment.&#8221;</em></p><p>By the end of the article, I had never felt prouder to be a chronically late person.</p><p>But also, what the hell is going on? Late people are the <em>worst</em>. It&#8217;s the quality I like <em>least </em>in myself. And I&#8217;m not late because I like to smell the roses, or because I can see the big picture, or because the future is full of infinite possibilities.</p><p>I&#8217;m late because I&#8217;m insane.</p><p>So I thought about this for a minute, and I think I figured out what&#8217;s going on. The issue is that there are two kinds of lateness:</p><p><strong>1) Okay lateness.</strong> This is when the late person being late does not negatively impact anyone else—like being late to a group hangout or a party. Things can start on time and proceed as normal with or without the late person being there yet.</p><p><strong>2) Not okay lateness. </strong>This is when the late person being late <em>does</em> negatively impact others—like being late to a two-person dinner or meeting or anything else that simply can&#8217;t start until the late party arrives.</p><p>Haltiwanger&#8217;s article is (I hope) talking mostly about <em>okay </em>lateness. In which case sure, maybe those people are the best, who knows.</p><p>But if you read the comment section under Haltiwanger&#8217;s article, people are <em>furious</em> with him for portraying lateness in a positive light. And that&#8217;s because <em>they&#8217;re </em>thinking about the far less excusable <em>not </em>okay lateness.</p><p>All of this has kind of left me with no choice but to take a quick nine-hour break from working on the gargantuan SpaceX post to discuss <em>not </em>okay late people.</p><p>When it comes to people who are chronically not okay late, I think there are two subgroups:</p><p><strong>Group 1) Those who don&#8217;t feel bad or wrong about it. </strong>These people are assholes.</p><p><strong>Group 2) Those who feel terrible and self-loathing about it. </strong>These people have problems.</p><p>Group 1 is simple. They think they&#8217;re a little more special than everyone else, like the zero-remorse narcissist <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/optimistic-people-have-one-thing-common-always-late/1097735/\" target=\"_blank\">at the top</a> of Haltiwanger&#8217;s article. They&#8217;re unappealing. Not much else to discuss here.</p><p>Punctual people think <em>all </em>not okay late people are in Group 1 (as the comments on this post will show)—because they&#8217;re assuming all late people are sane people.</p><p>When a sane person thinks a certain kind of behavior is fine, they do it. When they think it&#8217;s wrong, they don&#8217;t do it. So to a punctual person—one who shows up on time because they believe showing up late is the wrong thing to do—someone who&#8217;s chronically late must be an asshole who thinks being late is okay.</p><p>But that&#8217;s misunderstanding the entire second group, who, despite being consistently late, usually detest the concept of making other people wait. Let call them CLIPs (Chronically Late Insane Person).</p><p>While both groups of not okay late people end up regularly frustrating others, a reliable way to identify a Group 2 CLIP is a bizarre compulsion to defeat themselves—some deep inner drive to inexplicably miss the beginning of movies, endure psychotic stress running to catch the train, crush their own reputation at work, etc. etc. As much as they may hurt others, they usually hurt themselves even more.</p><p>I come from a long line of CLIPs. I spent around 15% of my youth standing on some sidewalk alone, angrily kicking rocks, because yet <em>again</em>, all the other kids had gotten picked up and I was still waiting for my mom. When she finally arrived, instead of being able to have a pleasant conversation with her, I&#8217;d get into the car seething. She always felt terrible. She has problems.</p><p>My sister once missed an early morning flight, so they rescheduled her for the following morning. She managed to miss that one <em>too</em>, so they put her on a flight five hours later. Killing time during the long layover, she got distracted on a long phone call and <em>missed that flight too. </em>She has problems<em>. </em></p><p>I&#8217;ve been a CLIP my whole life. I&#8217;ve made a bunch of friends mad at me, I&#8217;ve embarrassed myself again and again in professional situations, and I&#8217;ve run a cumulative marathon through airport terminals. It&#8217;s often the same story, something like this:</p><p>I&#8217;ll be meeting someone, maybe a professional contact, at, say, a coffee place at 3:00. When I lay out my schedule for the day, I&#8217;ll have the perfect plan. I&#8217;ll leave early, arrive early, and get there around 2:45. That takes all the stress out of the situation, and that&#8217;s ideal because non-stressful commutes are one of my favorite things. It&#8217;ll be great—I&#8217;ll stroll out, put on a podcast, and head to the subway. Once I&#8217;m off the subway, with time to spare, I&#8217;ll take a few minutes to peruse storefronts, grab a lemonade from a street vendor, and <em>enjoy New York</em>. It&#8217;ll be such a joy to look up at the architecture, listen to the sounds, and feel the swell of people rushing by—oh magnificent city!</p><p>All I have to do is be off the subway by 2:45. To do that, I need to be on the subway by 2:25, so let&#8217;s be safe and get to the subway by 2:15. So I have to leave my apartment by 2:07 or earlier, and I&#8217;m set. What a plan. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;ll play out (if you&#8217;re new to WBW, you&#8217;re advised to <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">check this

I&#8217;m sure each CLIP is insane in their own special way, and to understand how they work, you&#8217;ll usually have to get to some dark inner psychology. For me, it&#8217;s some mix of these three odd traits:</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I&#8217;m late because I&#8217;m in denial about how time works.</span> </strong>The propensity of CLIPs to underestimate how long things take comes out of some habitual delusional optimism. Usually what happens is, of all the times the CLIP has done a certain activity or commute, what they remember is that one time things went the <em>quickest</em>. And <em>that </em>amount of time is what sticks in their head as how long that thing takes. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s <em>anything </em>that will get me to internalize that packing for a week-long trip takes 20 minutes. In my head, it&#8217;s eternally a five-minute task. You just take out the bag, throw some clothes in it, throw your toiletries in, zip it up and done. Five minutes. The empirical data that shows that there are actually a lot of little things to think about when you pack and that it takes 20 minutes every time is irrelevant. Packing is clearly a five-minute task. As I type this, that&#8217;s what I believe.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">I&#8217;m late because I have a weird aversion to changing circumstances.</span> </strong>Not sure what the deal is with this, but something in me is strangely appalled by the idea of transitioning from what I&#8217;m currently doing to doing something else. When I&#8217;m at home working, I <em>hate </em>when there&#8217;s something on my schedule that I have to stop everything for to go outside and do. It&#8217;s not that I hate the activity—once I&#8217;m there I&#8217;m often pleased to be there—it&#8217;s an irrational resistance to the <em>transition</em>. The positive side of this is it usually means I&#8217;m highly present when I finally do haul my ass somewhere, and I&#8217;m often among the last to leave.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Finally, I&#8217;m late because I&#8217;m mad at myself. </strong></span>There&#8217;s a pretty strong correlation here—the worse I feel about my productivity so far that day, the more likely I am to be late. When I&#8217;m pleased with how I&#8217;ve lived the day so far, the Rational Decision-Maker has a much easier time taking control of the wheel. I feel like an adult, so it&#8217;s easy to act like an adult. But times when the monkey had his way with me all day, when the time rolls around that I need to stop working and head out somewhere, I can&#8217;t <em>believe</em> that this is <em>all</em> I&#8217;ve gotten done. So my brain throws a little tantrum, refusing to accept the regrettable circumstances, and stages a self-flagellating protest, saying, &#8220;NO. This can<em>not </em>be the situation. Nope. You didn&#8217;t do what you were supposed to do, and now you&#8217;ll sit here and get more done, even if it makes you late.&#8221;</p><p>So yeah, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m late—because I&#8217;m insane. Don&#8217;t excuse the CLIPs in your life—it&#8217;s not okay and they need to fix it—but remember, it&#8217;s not about you.

So then I research that new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down. My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.</p><p>For example, I kind of got the Iraq situation, but there was a lot of fog there too—so when I wrote <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">a post</a> about it, one fog-clearing rabbit hole took me all the way back to Muhammad in 570AD. That was the floor. Digging into another part of the story brought me to the end of World War I. Another brought me to the founding of ISIS.</p><p>Hitting the floor is a great feeling and makes me realize that the adults weren’t actually saying anything that complicated or icky after all. And when I come across that topic again, it’s <em>fun </em>now, because I <em>get </em>it and I can nod with a serious face on and be like, “Yes, interest rates are problematic” like a real person.</p><p>I’ve heard people compare knowledge of a topic to a tree. If you don’t fully get it, it’s like a tree in your head with no trunk—and without a trunk, when you learn something new about the topic—a new branch or leaf of the tree—there’s nothing for it to hang onto, so it just falls away. By clearing out fog all the way to the bottom, I build a tree trunk in my head, and from then on, all new information can hold on, which makes that topic forever more interesting and productive to learn about. And what I usually find is that so many of the topics I’ve pegged as “boring” in my head are actually just foggy to me—like watching episode 17 of a great show, which would be boring if you didn’t have the tree trunk of the back story and characters in place.</p><p>So when it was time to start what I had labeled in my head as “the Tesla post,” I knew this was going to be one of those posts. To understand if and why Tesla Motors matters, you have to understand both the story of cars and the story of energy—two worlds I somehow am simultaneously confused by and tremendously sick of. Just hearing someone say “climate change” or “energy crisis” or “tailpipe emissions” makes me kind of gag at this point—just too much politics, too many annoying people, too much misinformation on all sides, and it’s just hard to know how much I actually care and if there can be a solution to all of it anyway. So I did what I do when my tortoise shits when I’m out of the apartment and then spends hours walking through it and tracking it across everything, including the walls somehow—I rolled up my sleeves, took a deep breath, whispered, “Be a man, Tim,” and started scraping through layers of shit. If I have to live in a world with people arguing constantly about energy and oil and greenhouse gases and incentive programs, I might as well build myself a proper tree trunk.</p><p>After weeks of reading and asking questions and writing, I’ve emerged from the tortoise sewage with something that toes the line between a long blog post and a short book. I could have broken this into multiple posts, but it’s all one story and I wanted to keep it all together. It’ll be a bit of a time investment, but I think you’ll come out of it with a sturdier tree trunk about all of this than you have now. And as it turns out, when it comes to this topic, we may be witnessing a very awesome moment in history without quite realizing it yet.</p><p>Two disclaimers before we start:</p><p>1) This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political agenda. I’m not political because nothing could <em>ever possibly be more annoying </em>than American politics. I think both parties have good points, both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things, and I want nothing to do with it. So I approached this post—like I try to with every post—from a standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense.</p><p>2) Spoiler: The post is very pro-Tesla. Which might seem suspicious since A) Elon Musk asked me to write about this and B) I just wrote a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> calling him the raddest possible man. But two things to keep in mind:</p><p>First, this isn’t commissioned by Musk, and I’m being paid $0.00 for doing it. He suggested I take the issue on because I think he thinks there’s a lack of full tree trunks in people’s heads about it—but he never suggested that I say good things about Tesla, electric cars, or anything else.</p><p>Second, the currency Wait But Why lives on is integrity. Without it, WBW loses its ability to make an impact. And integrity came first here, even at the expense of Musk potentially hating me at the end of it, if that’s what was necessary. If I didn’t think this would have made a great WBW topic, I wouldn’t have taken it on, and I’m pro-Tesla in the post because after a ton of learning and thinking—including as many counterarguments to Tesla and its worldview as I could find—that’s how I feel.</p><p>And with that, let’s dive in.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 20pt;\">Contents</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">     <a href=\"#part1\">Part 1: The Story of Energy</a></span></strong><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"#part2\">Part 2: The Story of Cars</a></span></strong><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">  <a href=\"#part3\">Part 3: The Story of Tesla<br /></a></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a>Part 1: The Story of Energy</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3780 alignnone\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png\" alt=\"Story of Energy\" width=\"185\" height=\"163\" /></a></p><p>Energy is important. Without energy, we’d all be like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lying-Down.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3751\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lying-Down.png\" alt=\"Lying Down\" width=\"400\" height=\"152\" /></a></p><p>But what really is energy? The dictionary says it’s “the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform work.” And it says “work” is “the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.” Putting that together, we get energy being “the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.”</p><p>That was pretty unfun, so for our purposes, let’s call energy “the thing that lets something do stuff.”</p><p>But the tricky thing about energy is the law of conservation of energy, which says that energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another. And since every living thing needs energy in order to do stuff—and you can’t make your own energy—we’re all awkwardly left with no choice but to steal the energy we need from someone else.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3667\" id=\"note-1-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3667\" id=\"note2-1-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><sup>← <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">click these</span></sup></span></p><p>Almost all of the energy used by the Earth’s living things got to us in the first place from the sun.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3667\" id=\"note-2-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> The sun’s energy is what makes the wind blow and the rain fall and it’s what powers the Earth’s living things—the biosphere.</p><p>The joule is a common unit of energy—defined as the amount of energy it takes to apply a force of one newton through a distance of one meter<a href=\"#footnote-3-3667\" id=\"note-3-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a>. While the sun’s joules can provide any animal with heat and light, the joules that <em>power </em>all of us from the inside enter the biosphere in the first place when the sun gives them to plants.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3785\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png\" alt=\"Sun\" width=\"341\" height=\"347\" /></a></p><p>That’s how food is invented—plants know how to take the sun’s joules and turn them into food.</p><p>At that point, all hell breaks loose as everyone starts murdering everyone else so they can steal their joules.</p><p>We use “the food chain” as a cute euphemism for this murder/theft cycle, and we use the word “eating” to refer to “stealing someone else’s joules and also murdering them too.” A “predator” is a dick who always seems to want <em>your </em>joules over everyone else’s, and “prey” is just some sniveling nerd you particularly like to bully and steal lunch money from. Plants are the only innocent ones who actually follow the Golden Rule, but that’s just because they have the privilege of having the sun as their sugar daddy—and humans are the biosphere’s upsetting mafia boss who just takes what he wants from anyone he wants, whenever he wants. It’s not a great system, but it works.</p><p>And that all went on normally for a while, but in the last few hundred thousand years, humans started to realize something: while it was enjoyable to put new joules into your body, actually <em>using</em> those joules sucked. It’s much less fun to use a bunch of joules running fast or lifting something heavy than it is to just sit on a log pleasantly and hold onto those joules instead. So humans got clever and started to figure out ways to get joules<em> outside </em>their bodies to do work for them—by doing that, humans could have their joules and eat them too. Sometimes the methods would be dickish:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\" alt=\"Horse hand\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" /></a></p><p>But joules aren’t only in living things. There are joules floating and swirling and zooming all around us, and by inventing the concept of <em>technology</em>, humans figured out ways to get use out of them. They made windmills that could steal some of the wind’s joules as it went by and convert them into mechanical energy to grind food. They built sailboats that would convert wind joules into kinetic boat energy they could control. Water absorbs the sun’s radiation joules and turns them into gravitational potential energy joules when it evaporates and then kinetic energy joules when it rains and slides down land, and humans saw the opportunity to snatch some of those up by creating water wheels or dams.</p><p>But the most exciting joule-stealing technology humans came up with was figuring out how to <em>burn</em> something. With wind or water, you can only capture moving joules as they go by—but when you burn something, you can take an object that has been soaking up joules for years and release them <em>all at once</em>. A joule explosion.</p><p>They called this explosion fire, and because the joules that emerged were in the useful-to-humans formats of heat energy and light energy, burning things became a popular activity.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Taming a Dragon</strong></span></p><p>We had learned to <em>harness </em>the joules of the wind and the water—to take those forces by the reins and make them ours—but when it came to the most joule-heavy force of all, fire, we couldn’t really figure out how to do anything with it other than hang out near it, cook some stuff, and generally benefit from its existence. Fire was a hectic dragon and no one had figured out how to grab its reins.</p><p>And then came the breakthrough. Steam.</p><p>Fire joules were hard to harness, but if you sent them into water, they’d get the water molecules to increasingly freak out and bounce around until finally those molecules would fully panic and start flying off the surface, evaporating upwards with the force of the raging fire below. You’d have successfully converted the thermal energy joules of the fire—which we didn’t know how to directly harness—into a powerful jet of steam we could control.</p><p>With the muscle of steam in their toolkit, the inventors of the 18th century burst into innovation. They had some serious <em>joules </em>to work with now, which opened worlds of previously-unthinkable possibility. Breakthroughs led to more breakthroughs, and at the turn of the 19th century, the progress culminated in an invention that’s often called the most impactful turning point in human history: the steam engine.</p><p>Picture your tea kettle when it gets all angry at you and starts whistling. Now imagine that instead of the steam spewing out through the nozzle, you connected the nozzle to a tube, which directs the bursting steam into an empty cylinder and then finally releases it. When the steam goes into and then out of the cylinder, it shoves a “piston” inside the cylinder on a powerful back-and-forth motion. That’s (a dramatic oversimplification of) how a steam engine works. Depending on the vehicle, the back-and-forth motion of the piston can do different things. In the example of a locomotive, the piston is attached to a rod whose back-and-forth motion turns the wheels:<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3667\" id=\"note2-2-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3681 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif\" alt=\"rodsmed\" width=\"549\" height=\"168\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using the steam engine, humanity upgraded from sailboats to steamships and from animal-drawn carts to locomotives.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3667\" id=\"note-4-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> Inside factories, people put steam to work too, swapping out their water wheels for much more effective steam-powered wheels.</p><p>With the new ability to transport many more goods and materials, much farther away, much more quickly, and to far more efficient factories, the Industrial Revolution ignited in full force. People say the Industrial Revolution was powered by steam, but steam was just the middleman—after hundreds of thousands of years of existing as passive benefactors of combustion, we had tamed the dragon, and the Industrial Revolution was powered by <em>fire.</em></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Striking Gold</strong></span></p><p>The one thing about having made fire our bitch is that we now wanted to burn a lot more things than we ever had before. For most of human history, when people wanted to burn something, they just went and found some wood. Easy. Except now it was the 19th century, and with our new appetite to burn, wood wouldn’t cut it anymore.</p><p>We knew there were other things we could burn—in Britain, they would often supplement wood by burning a black rocky substance they found on their shores. They called it coal.</p><p>The problem is that unlike wood, most of the coal in Britain wasn’t just sitting conveniently on land—it was underground. When the Industrial Revolution got going, the British started digging—they were gonna need a lot of coal. As the revolution spread through Europe and to North America, Europeans and Americans started digging too—they also were gonna need a lot of coal.</p><p>As everyone dug, they started finding other things too. They found pockets of burnable air we call natural gas and underground lakes of thick, black burnable liquid we call crude oil. It turns out that this whole time, humans had been walking around with a vast untapped treasure of tightly packed, burnable joules right underneath them. It was like a dog digging in the woods to bury a bone and uncovering an underground cave full of pulled pork.</p><p>And what does a dog do who finds a cave of pulled pork? Does he pause to think cautiously about how to proceed or consider consequences for his health? No—he eats the shit out of it. Mindlessly, at full speed.</p><p>And throughout the 19th century, coal mines and oil rigs popped up everywhere. Burning this new treasure of joules made economies soar and the incentive to innovate soared along with them—and new, fantastic technologies were born.</p><p>Like steam engine technology, the credit for the electricity revolution is owed to a collaboration of dozens of innovators spanning centuries, but it was in the 1880s that it all finally came together. In what is still probably the most significant technological shift of all time, electricity allowed the raucous power of burning to be converted into a highly tame and remarkably versatile form of energy called electrical energy. With steam as a key middleman, all those spastic combustion joules could now be sent into an organized grid of wires, transferred long distances, and delivered into residential and commercial buildings where it would wait patiently in an outlet ready to be discharged at the user’s convenience.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3667\" id=\"note-5-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> At that point, the now electrical joules could be converted into almost any kind of energy—they could boil water, freeze ice, light up the room, or make a phone call. If steam had tamed the dragon, electricity had turned the dragon into a magical butler, forever at our service. And for the first time in human history, the power was on.</p><p>Right around the time this was happening, another revolution was underway. Fire was now powering our ships, our trains, our factories, and even the new wizardry of electricity, but individual transportation was still powered by hay like it was 1775—and late 19th century humanity knew we could do better. Biological horses got super upset if you tried to power them by fire, so again, humanity got innovating, and a couple decades later, there were big, metal, horses everywhere with engine cylinders full of fire.</p><p>As coal, oil, and natural gas motivated unprecedented innovation, the resulting waves of new technologies created an unprecedented need to burn stuff—which motivated the diggers. Companies that focused on digging, sucking, and siphoning up more and more of our underground joule treasure, like John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, became the world’s biggest corporate empires. It was a new world, powered by an endless cave of pulled pork, being gorged upon by the world’s happiest dog…</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Flash forward to the present day.</p><p>Burning our bounty of underground joule-packed fuel to power our world is now an innovation more than two centuries old—but in 2015, it’s still the main way humans get their power:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3667\" id=\"note2-3-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3729\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png\" alt=\"Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" /></a></p><p>That’s the thing about dogs—if given something delicious, they tend to eat until the food runs out or they get sick, whichever comes first, and there aren’t too many other factors in play. The modern energy debate essentially boils down to whether it’s okay that the dog is still fully enjoying himself in the cave or whether it’s not because he might be making himself dangerously sick or risk running out of pulled pork—which would be a problem, because he has grown increasingly large since finding the cave, and he has no way outside the cave of feeding his now-immense appetite.</p><p>As you might have noticed, there are a lot of people who have a lot of opinions for a lot of reasons saying a lot of things about this situation. And some are saying real things, but a large portion of them either don’t especially know what they’re talking about or they have some ulterior motive for saying what they’re saying. This makes an already complex, murky, multi-faceted topic even more confusing.</p><p>So let’s lay out what we do know and try to clarify what the hell is really going on.</p><p>To begin with—what exactly are fossil fuels and where do they come from?</p><p>Fossil fuels are called fossil fuels because they’re the remains of ancient living things. “Ancient” in this case spans a wide range. The earliest organisms that contribute to today’s fossil fuels lived during the Precambrian Eon, before there were any plants and animals on land—the fossil organisms then would have been ocean algae. People often think fossil fuels are made of dinosaurs, but any dinosaurs in our gasoline are from the last couple hundred million years—the later stretch of the timespan—and only a small contributor. The largest portion of our fossil fuels comes from plants, animals, and algae that lived during the Carboniferous Period—a 50 million year period that ended about 300 million years ago and during which there were lots of huge, shallow swamps. The swamps were important because it made it more likely that a dead organism would be preserved. You don’t become a fossil fuel if you die in a normal place and decompose away. But by dying in a swamp and sinking to the bottom, Carboniferous organisms often ended up being quickly covered by sand and clay and were able to make it underground with their joules still intact.</p><p>After hundreds of millions of years, all those organisms were squashed under intense heat and pressure and became converted into joule-dense solid, liquid, or gas—coal, oil, and natural gas. Quick blue box brush-up:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Fossil Fuels Brush-Up</strong></span></p><p><strong>Coal</strong>, a black sedimentary rock that’s found in underground layers called coal beds, is the cheapest and most plentiful of the three and is used almost entirely for making electricity. It’s also the worst culprit for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, releasing about 30% more CO<sub>2</sub> than the burning of oil and about double that of natural gas when generating an equivalent amount of heat.<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3667\" id=\"note2-4-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> The US is to coal as Saudi Arabia is to oil, possessing 22% of the world’s coal, the most of any nation. China, though, has become by far the world’s largest consumer of coal—over <em>half </em>of the coal burned in the world in recent years was burned in China.<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3667\" id=\"note2-5-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p><strong>Oil</strong>, also known as crude oil or petroleum, is a gooey black liquid normally found in deep underground reservoirs. When crude oil is extracted, it heads to the refinery, where it’s separated, using different boiling points, into a bunch of different things. Here’s how a typical barrel of US oil was broken down in 2014:<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3667\" id=\"note2-6-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><ul><li class=\"p1\">44.9% gas for cars</li><li class=\"p1\">29.8% heating oil and diesel fuels</li><li class=\"p1\">13.8% other products like wax, synthetic rubber, and plastics</li><li class=\"p1\">9.5% jet fuel (kerosene)</li><li class=\"p1\">2.0% asphalt</li></ul><p>The United States is by far the biggest consumer of oil in the world, consuming over 20% of the world’s oil and about double the next biggest consumer. The US is also one of the three biggest oil producers in the world, alongside Saudi Arabia and Russia, who all produce roughly the same amount.<a href=\"#footnote-6-3667\" id=\"note-6-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p><strong>Natural gas</strong>, which is formed when underground oil gets to a super-high temperature and vaporizes, is found in underground pockets, usually in the vicinity of oil reserves. The “cleanest” of the three fossil fuels, it’s the gas that fires up your stove or heats your apartment (if those aren’t electricity-powered or heated by oil), and it’s one of the major sources of electricity (it makes up about 20% of electricity in the US). Natural gas is on the rise and now makes up almost a quarter of the world’s energy. One of the reasons it’s on the rise is that scientists have found a new way of extracting natural gas from the Earth called hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” which uses a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals to create cracks in natural gas-rich shale and force out the gas. This method has been hugely effective, but it’s also controversial because of some serious environmental concerns—<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> explains it well.</p></div><p>As for the reasons people argue that fossil fuels are problematic, we’re going to focus on the two most common—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>ISSUE 1: Climate Change is a Thing</strong></span></p><p>Let’s ignore all the politicians and professors and CEOs and filmmakers and look at three facts:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 1) Burning Fossil Fuels Makes Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Rise</strong></span></p><p>We’ll get to the data in a second, but first—why does burning fossil fuels emit CO<sub>2</sub>?</p><p>The answer is simple: <strong>combustion is reverse photosynthesis.</strong></p><p>When a plant grows, it makes its own food through photosynthesis. At its most oversimplified, during photosynthesis, the plant takes CO<sub>2</sub> from the air<a href=\"#footnote-7-3667\" id=\"note-7-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> and absorbs light energy from the sun to split the CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon (C) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The plant keeps the carbon and emits the oxygen as a waste product. The sun’s light energy stays in the plant as chemical energy the plant can use.</p><p>So wood is essentially a block of carbon and stored chemical energy.</p><p>When you burn a log, all you’re doing is reversing the photosynthesis. Normally, oxygen in the air just bounces off carbon molecules in wood—that’s why trees aren’t constantly on fire. But when an oxygen molecule gets moving fast enough and <em>smashes </em>into a log’s carbon molecule, they <em>snap</em> together and the oxygen and carbon are reunited again as CO<sub>2</sub>. This snapping releases chemical energy, which knocks into other nearby oxygen molecules, causing <em>them </em>to get going fast—and if they get going fast enough, they’ll snap together with another of the log’s carbon molecules, which releases <em>more</em> chemical energy. This causes a chain reaction, and the log is now on fire. So a log burning is the process of the carbon in the log combining with oxygen in the air and floating off as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Of course, that’s all irrelevant to the person burning the log—what <em>they </em>care about is the <em>energy </em>released during all of this CO<sub>2 </sub>formation. The release of all of the log’s stored chemical energy creates a glorious blaze of heat and light. The tree spent years quietly absorbing carbon<sub> </sub>molecules and sunshine joules, and all at once, during combustion, that carbon and sunshine explode back out into the world.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3667\" id=\"note-8-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><p>To put it another way, photosynthesis just kidnaps carbon and sun energy out of the atmosphere, and after years of holding them hostage, combustion sets them both free—the carbon as a billowing eruption of newly reunited CO<sub>2</sub>, and the sun energy as fire—meaning that fire is essentially just tightly packed sunshine.</p><p>But burning a log and releasing all that CO<sub>2 </sub>does <em>not </em>tamper with the atmosphere’s carbon levels. Why? Because the carbon that’s being released was recently <em>in</em> the atmosphere, and if you hadn’t set the log on fire, it would have likely decomposed, which would release the carbon back into the world anyway. The log’s carbon was only being held <em>temporarily</em> hostage, and releasing it through combustion has little effect.</p><p>Carbon flows from the atmosphere into plants and animals, into the ground and water, and then back out of all those things into the atmosphere—that’s called the carbon cycle. At any given point in time, the Earth’s active carbon cycle contains a specific amount of carbon. Burning a log doesn’t change that level because the carbon cycle “expects” that carbon to be hanging around the ground, water, or air.</p><p>But sometimes, a small portion of carbon in the cycle drops <em>out </em>of the cycle for the long term—it happens when a plant or animal dies but for some reason <em>doesn’t </em>decay normally. Instead, before it can decay and release its carbon back into the cycle, it’s buried underground. Over time, that lost carbon adds up. And today, the Earth’s fossil fuels make up a huge mass of lost carbon—carbon that long ago was taken hostage <em>permanently</em>, and carbon that the carbon cycle does <em>not </em>expect to be involved in its routine.</p><p>When humans discovered all of this underground kidnapped carbon, you have to remember that for them, the carbon wasn’t the point. They were staring at an endless sea of 300 million-year-old, densely packed sunshine—trillions of ancient plants with their <em>joules</em><em> intact</em>—and since there are no laws protecting the estates of Carboniferous plants, we could seize it all for ourselves. The grandest joule theft in history.</p><p>And as we helped ourselves, we didn’t worry about the fact that extracting those joules also meant extracting carbon that had been buried as far back as the Precambrian period—there were locomotives to fuel and cars to power and buildings to heat, and the joules were irresistible.</p><p>And those joules have gone a long way—you can thank them for the comforts and quality of your life today. But those carbon molecules have gone a long way too.</p><p>Starting in 1958, scientist Charles Keeling started measuring atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels from an observatory on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Those measurements are still going on today. Here’s what they show:<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3667\" id=\"note2-7-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3790 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png\" alt=\"Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg\" width=\"475\" height=\"475\" /></a></p><p>The zig-zaggy motion of the line is due to the level falling each year in the summer when plants are sucking up CO<sub>2</sub> and rising up again during the winter when the leaves are dead. But the overarching trend is unmistakable. To put that into context, ice drilling technology<a href=\"#footnote-9-3667\" id=\"note-9-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> allows scientists to collect accurate data on what CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been throughout the last 400,000 years. Here’s what they’ve found:<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3667\" id=\"note2-8-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3707 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png\" alt=\"co2_variations\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" /></a></p><p>So atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels have oscillated<a href=\"#footnote-10-3667\" id=\"note-10-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> between about 180 and 300 parts per million over the last 400,000 years, never eclipsing 300, and suddenly in the last century the level has vaulted up to 400 (it’s <a href=\"http://co2now.org/\" target=\"_blank\">currently</a> at 403ppm).</p><p>So instead of the atmosphere being .02% or .03% carbon, it’s now .04% carbon and maybe moving towards .05% and higher. But let’s not judge anything yet. All we know is Fact #1, which tells us that CO<sub>2</sub> levels are rising quickly.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 2) Where Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Go, Temperatures Follow</strong></span></p><p>The ice cores dug up by scientists don’t just reveal the CO<sub>2</sub> levels going backwards in time—they reveal temperature too. Here’s what they show:<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3667\" id=\"note2-9-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3812\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png\" alt=\"temp graph\" width=\"538\" height=\"268\" /></a></p><p>Not a hard correlation to see. The reason for this is simple—CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas. The way an actual greenhouse works is the glass lets in sun energy and traps a lot of it inside as heat. There are a handful of chemicals in our atmosphere that do the same thing—sun rays come in, bounce off the Earth, and they’re on their way out when the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere block some of them and spread them through the atmosphere, warming things up.</p><p>Mars has an average temperature of -55ºC (-67ºF), which isn’t fun, but Venus is literally actual hell, with an average temperature of 462ºC (864ºF). No one is more of a dick than Venus. Why? CO<sub>2</sub>. Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth so the sun’s energy easily escapes, while Venus’s atmosphere is much thicker, with <em>300 times</em> the CO<sub>2</sub> as Earth, so it traps in a ton of heat. Mercury is <em>closer</em> to the sun than Venus, but with no atmosphere, it’s cooler than Venus. During the day, Mercury gets almost as hot as Venus, but at night it gets freezing, while Venus is just as hot at night as it is during the day, because the heat lives permanently in its thick atmosphere.</p><p>So it makes sense that an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> here would increase temperature—but by how much? When compared to the Pre-Industrial average temperature, our current average temperature has risen by a little less than 1ºC. But as CO<sub>2 </sub>levels keep rising, most scientists expect temperatures to keep rising. The UN-supported Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from a bunch of different countries, came out with <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> that laid out the temperature projections of a number of independent labs. This is what those labs think will happen if no action is taken to alter the current trends in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3667\" id=\"note2-10-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3715 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png\" alt=\"Global_Warming_Predictions\" width=\"398\" height=\"284\" /></a></p><p>A small minority argue that these future projections are overblown—they <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fossil-fuels-will-save-the-world-really-1426282420\" target=\"_blank\">point out</a> that they ride on the largely accepted theory that water vapor in the atmosphere multiplies the effect of carbon emissions because of a “feedback” loop, whereby a small increase in temperature from extra CO<sub>2 </sub>increases water evaporation, and since water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, that creates more warmth, which further increases more evaporation, and on and on. Without this feedback loop, the temperature increases resulting from CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions would be 2-3 times smaller. But even the greatest skeptics usually agree that CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions do lead to temperature increases.</p><p>The IPCC also puts it at over 90% that the changes in both CO<sub>2 </sub>levels and temperature are caused by human activity (which is kind of like saying there’s over a 90% chance that a rain storm has been caused by cloud activity). Now the question becomes—how much does the temperature need to change to make everything shitty?</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 3) The Temperature Doesn’t Need to Change Very Much to Make Everything Shitty</strong></span></p><p>18,000 years ago, global temperatures were about 5ºC lower than the 20th century average. That was enough to put Canada, Scandinavia, and half of England and the US under a half a mile of ice. That’s what 5ºC can do.<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3667\" id=\"note2-11-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3702 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"550\" height=\"210\" /></p><p>100 million years ago, temperatures were 6-10ºC higher than they are now—and every region of the Earth was tropical, there was no permanent ice anywhere, ocean levels were <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142729/Cretaceous-Period\" target=\"_blank\">200 meters</a> higher, and this kind of shit was happening:<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3667\" id=\"note2-12-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3810\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg\" alt=\"T-rex-120501\" width=\"297\" height=\"327\" /></a></p><p>So we’re currently in this not-that-big window we probably should try to stay in:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3763\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png\" alt=\"temp spectrum\" width=\"647\" height=\"303\" /></a></p><p>This is also even more fragile than is intuitive. First, you don’t need the <em>average</em> temperature to go up by a catastrophic amount to have a catastrophe—because the average temp could go up by only 3ºC but the <em>max </em>temp rises by a lot more. Just <em>one day</em> at an outlier high like 58ºC (136ºF) would wipe out most of the Earth’s crops and animals. Second, because the total range of temperature a planet can be goes all the way down to absolute zero: -273ºC (-459ºF). So a difference of 5ºC, enough to bury the northern part of the world under an ocean of ice, is really only about a 1.5% fluctuation in temperature—not something like 10%, which is what it seems like. Looking at the window on a spectrum that shows the full range emphasizes that the world we’re used to is what it is only because of a very specific and delicate balance of conditions.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3782\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"temp spectrum 2\" width=\"683\" height=\"255\" /></a></p><p>As mentioned above, right now, the average temp is edging upwards to 1ºC above the Pre-Industrial norm (the IPCC <a href=\"http://www.climatechange2013.org/\" target=\"_blank\">puts us</a> at +.86ºC currently). Scientists debate how high that number can go before really dramatic changes start to happen. For the last 20 years, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7242/full/nature08017.html\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 countries</a> have agreed to try to limit global warming to a 2ºC increase, but there are all of these different opinions going around about that. Regarding the effects of a 2ºC increase, in my research, I came across some credible sources saying 2º is an unnecessarily low ceiling and that that we can afford to safely go higher and others saying that 2º is <em>too</em> high a target and that we’re underestimating how catastrophic a change of 2º would be. Regarding our ability to stay under 2º, I’ve also heard varying opinions—some think we can stay under 2º with proper restrictions; others think there’s no possible way we can stay under 2º—that there’s enough upward momentum already that even if we stopped creating carbon emissions in the next few years, the Earth would keep warming past 2º.</p><p>So what are we supposed to make of this?</p><p>Our goal today is <em>not </em>to dig deep into these conflicting opinions and try to figure out the truth, because no one knows for sure anyway. We’re not going to talk about specific things like sea levels, pollution, storms, or that polar bear in the video who’s extra sad because his ice is melting. We’re just going to take our three facts and put them all together and see what happens:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3783\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel.png\" alt=\"Cancel\" width=\"686\" height=\"182\" /></a></p><p>This simplifies down to:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3784\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel-2.png\" alt=\"Cancel 2\" width=\"500\" height=\"62\" /></a></p><p>Interesting.

But actually, the Earth’s fossil fuel supply is not endless—it’s endful.</p><p><em>When </em>we run out is a complicated and hazy question. You have sites like <a href=\"http://knoema.com/smsfgud/world-reserves-of-fossil-fuels\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> citing reports like <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> making charts that suggest that if we continue as is, we’re not very far from the end:<a href=\"#footnote2-13-3667\" id=\"note2-13-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FFs-remaining.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3813\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FFs-remaining.png\" alt=\"FFs remaining\" width=\"600\" height=\"212\" /></a></p><p>Then you have sites like <a href=\"https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/our-green-energy/energy-independence/the-end-of-fossil-fuels\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> citing the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html\" target=\"_blank\">CIA World Factbook</a> and reminding us that when oil and natural gas run out, the coal usage will ramp up, so we actually have even <em>less</em> time:<a href=\"#footnote2-14-3667\" id=\"note2-14-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/end-of-fossil-fuels-graph.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3709 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/end-of-fossil-fuels-graph.jpg\" alt=\"end-of-fossil-fuels-graph\" width=\"475\" height=\"311\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fossil-fuels-will-save-the-world-really-1426282420\" target=\"_blank\">Other sites</a> point out that those cited totals are just referring to <em>proven</em> reserves, and that each year, we’re discovering new sources of fossil fuels, like oil locked in <a href=\"http://ostseis.anl.gov/guide/tarsands/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">tar sands</a> or abundant reserves of <a href=\"http://geology.com/articles/methane-hydrates/\" target=\"_blank\">methane hydrate</a> under the ocean floor, and developing new technologies to reach them, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA\" target=\"_blank\">fracking</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dccleaningsystem.com/development-tendency-of-horizontal-directional-drilling/\" target=\"_blank\">horizontal drilling</a>. Those sources suggest we’re unlikely to run out of fossil fuels for many centuries. A common counter to those sources is that even without running out, we could face a serious problem if the extraction of the fuels becomes more and more difficult and expensive over time.</p><p>The problem with running out, whenever it happens, is that if the world is anywhere near as reliant on fossil fuels at that point as we are now, it’ll cause an epic economic collapse. As fossil fuels grow more and more scarce, prices will skyrocket. That will cause a furious rush to develop renewable energy technology, but it may be too late at that point to prevent a worldwide economic meltdown.</p><p>Basically, we’re currently living off of a trust fund we found underground, and we’d better learn how to get a job before it runs out.</p><p>For our sum-up for this section, how about:</p><p><strong>At some point in the future, either really soon or just a little soon, we’ll have no choice but to stop running everything on fossil fuels, because they’ll either be gone or too expensive.</strong></p><p>This statement highlights the fact that we’re very much in what will be known as the Fossil Fuel Era of human history.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3766\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\" alt=\"FF Timeline\" width=\"700\" height=\"221\" /></a></p><p>Bringing back our first statement—<em>if we continue to burn fossil fuels as much as we are, things might get really shitty kind of soon</em>—suggests that if we continue to dick around in the black zone until we’re forced out by short supply, we’re risking <em>making the yellow zone permanently worse for humans to exist in. </em></p><p>This is why Elon Musk likes to say that the indefinite extension of the Fossil Fuels Era is “the dumbest experiment in history.” He emphasized this point to me: “The greater the change to the chemical composition of the physical, chemical makeup of the oceans and atmosphere [due to increased carbon emissions], the greater the long-term effect will be. Given that at some point they’ll run out anyway, why run this crazy experiment to see how bad it’ll be? We know it’s at least some bad, and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it’ll be really bad.”</p><p>In other words, as it relates to the above timeline—<em>there’s potentially huge long-term downside to staying in the black area for too long, so let’s just get ourselves to the yellow part as soon as we can. </em>Some skeptics I read made what seemed like very valid points, but even most skeptics agreed that burning of fossil fuels causes <em>some </em>degree of warming and that warming <em>might </em>turn out to be harmful. And even if we view this as a genuine debate—when one possibility is “turns out burning fossil fuels wasn’t actually dangerous” and the other side is “turns out burning fossil fuels was horribly catastrophic,” don’t we want to play it safe??</p><p>So how do we get from the black to the yellow?</p><p>To help us answer that question, let’s turn to the <a href=\"https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> and their useful energy charts. They update the US flowchart every year, and we’ll get there in a minute, but first, let’s check out some of the charts from their <a href=\"https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2011 report</a>, where they have a flow chart for every country and the world as a whole for the year 2007. (The charts look icky and confusing at first, but they’re actually really simple—just showing how much of each source is used and how that source is broken up among sectors.)</p><p>Here’s the<strong> combined world energy flow </strong>in 2007:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/World-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3802\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/World-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"World-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"592\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/World-2007.png\"><br /></a><br />
The unit, PJ, is in petajoules. 1 petajoule = 1 quadrillion joules. Some thoughts:</p><p>– The most consistent fact I noticed about all countries is how much petroleum (i.e. crude oil) dominates the transportation sector. 94% of the world’s transportation runs on oil, and in most developed countries, the percentage is even higher.</p><p>– Biomass use is pretty substantial, and almost all of it comes from developing countries, many of them in Africa. Biomass is typically the burning of things like wood, oil distilled down from food like corn, and manure.</p><p>– That’s a whole lot of rejected energy on the right side. Rejected energy is energy we lose, usually in the form of heat, due to inefficiency. Especially unimpressive is the transportation performance, where engines only end up using a quarter of the fuel they burn.</p><p>Next, let’s look at<strong> France:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3803\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"France-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"603\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/France-2007.png\"><br /></a><br />
Thoughts:</p><p>– Lots of nuclear, and as a result, very little coal. That makes France a pretty light CO<sub>2</sub> emitter.</p><p>– Their transportation, though, is like everyone else’s—running on oil.</p><p>– France is an example of a factor we’re not going to discuss in this post, but an important one: <strong>fossil fuels are a bit of a geopolitical nightmare</strong>. Nation interdependence can be productive and important, but nations being dependent on other nations for their <em>survival</em> is never a great thing, and the need to import fossil fuels is one of the major reasons for modern nation ultra-dependency. France is totally reliant on oil for its transportation and totally reliant on other countries for oil—this puts them in a vulnerable position. The US isn’t as dependent. It relied on other nations for 60% of its oil a decade ago but has since become one of the top three oil-producing countries, and the EIA <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/\" target=\"_blank\">projects</a> net oil imports to make up only 21% of the US’s 2015 oil consumption. I was also surprised <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_m.htm\" target=\"_blank\">to see</a> that only a small portion of US oil imports were from the Middle East, with only 12.5% of them coming from Saudi Arabia and 20% from the entire combined Persian Gulf. Far more was from the Western Hemisphere, with Canada by far the largest at 37% of imports and Mexico and Venezuela also prominent at 9% each.</p><p>Okay and how about <strong>China?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/China-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3804\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/China-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"China-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" /></a><br />
China is an energy monster, mostly because they’re an industrial monster. They’re also a coal-burning beast, burning through almost half of the world’s <em>total</em> coal consumption each year. That 57,000 PJ of coal consumption number is insane—over five times France’s total energy flow.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3805\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"598\" /></a><br />
Kind of a one-trick pony.</p><p>North Korea’s energy flow is, unsurprisingly, just weird:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3806\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"589\" /></a><br />
You can check out the <a href=\"https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">full report</a> to see the rest of the countries.</p><p>Now let’s move to 2013 and look at the <strong>US energy flow. </strong>The unit is different here. A quad = 1 quadrillion BTU, which is about 1,000 petajoules.<br /><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-2013-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3807\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-2013-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"US-2013-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"540\" /></a><br />
Two things that stand out:</p><p>– The US has become a natural gas consumption beast and by far the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/?view=consumption\" target=\"_blank\">biggest one</a> in the world.</p><p>– The US is even <em>more </em>of an oil-consumption beast—almost double the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/?view=consumption\" target=\"_blank\">second biggest</a> oil-consuming country, China, and more than four times #3 on the list, Japan.</p><p>To put in perspective how much energy the US uses, I found a country in the world that uses a similar amount of energy as each US state:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Energy-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3837\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Energy-Map.jpg\" alt=\"Energy Map\" width=\"900\" height=\"575\" /></a></p><p>Finally, let’s go back to the reason we started with these charts in the first place—to figure out how we’re gonna get from the black part of the timeline to the yellow and out of the fossil fuels area. The LLNL also produces a chart showing the US carbon emissions and where they come from. The US is the world’s <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8\" target=\"_blank\">second biggest</a> carbon emissions culprit (China is first with 50% more than the US) and the world leader in transportation emissions—so if we can figure out what the US needs to fix, that’s a good start.</p><p>Getting from the black to the yellow means getting rid of carbon emissions. Looking at the US emissions flowchart, I see two glaring numbers:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"US-Emissions-2013-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"594\" /></a></p><p>There are many things that need to happen to get us into the yellow zone, but these two figures—which make up 72% of total US emissions—seem like the biggest and most urgent problems to address:</p><p>1) Electricity production throughout the world makes up about 40% of the total energy flow, and roughly two thirds of electricity production comes from burning carbon-emitting fossil fuels, most prominently coal. Or, put simply: <strong>Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty.</strong></p><p>2) Transportation makes up a large chunk of the world’s energy flow, including near a third in most developed countries, and almost all the world’s transportation runs on petroleum. Put simply: <strong>Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</strong></p><p>We’ve spent this post zoomed far out on all of this. Now it’s time to zoom in, and we’ll zoom in on the second major problem listed above—transportation, and in particular, cars. Transportation covers planes, trains, ships, trucks, and cars—but cars cause more carbon emissions than the other four combined, and without major changes, car emissions are <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAG&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FMcKinsey%2Fdotcom%2Fclient_service%2FSustainability%2FPDFs%2Froads_toward_low_carbon_future_new.ashx&amp;ei=YbRbVbKpHpDZgwTv1oHgCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3SEeN0mjEnhTVGWEcgP3FFGFzDg&amp;sig2=Ycq_mTE6XiZBtnFhiqOB0Q\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to rise by over 50% by 2030. By zooming in on one major piece of this puzzle—car emissions—and examining how it became a problem, why it’s still a problem, and the way we might solve that problem, we’ll get a better sense of what this entire struggle is really made of.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part2\"></a>Part 2: The Story of Cars</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Cars.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3779\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Cars.png\" alt=\"Story of Cars\" width=\"200\" height=\"176\" /></a></p><p>Meet the world’s first car owner.<a href=\"#footnote2-15-3667\" id=\"note2-15-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3703 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress.jpg\" alt=\"640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress\" width=\"272\" height=\"453\" /></a></p><p>That’s the Chinese Emperor, Kangxi, in his driving clothes.

Edison’s company was busy rolling out electrical generating systems to power US cities, and working on these, Ford got good at working with the steam-powered engines the company used to make electricity. In his spare time, Ford sat in a little workshop next to his home playing around with the still-novel concept of the internal combustion engine, and in 1896, at the age of 32, he came up with what he called the Ford Quadricycle, powered by a simple internal combustion engine.<a href=\"#footnote2-24-3667\" id=\"note2-24-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">24</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3822\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"FordQuadricycle-compressor\" width=\"500\" height=\"405\" /></a></p><p>Becoming increasingly obsessed with building self-propelled vehicles, Ford quit his job in 1899 and first formed the Detroit Automobile Company, which failed, before forming the Henry Ford company in 1901. But Ford soon left the company over a dispute with the company’s investors, who then renamed it Cadillac Automobile Company, and in 1903, he went on to partner with a guy named Alexander Malcomson to create a company called Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd., which was later renamed Ford Motor Company. Super annoying for Malcomson.</p><p>Ford and his new company charged ahead making gas-powered cars, but at the time, gas cars were hardly the norm. Cars were a new technology, and at the beginning of the century, 40% of American cars were powered by steam and 38% were electric—gas cars only made up 22% of the American market.</p><p>These numbers make sense. Steam-centered external combustion was the older and best-understood technology of the three and was initially the most common way to power a car. Its fancier new cousin, the internal combustion engine, powered by burning gasoline, cut out the middleman and burned fuel more efficiently. But it’s no surprise that the quickest up-and-comer type of car was the electric car. It was 1900 and electricity was at the core of all the coolest, newest technology.</p><p>The 35 years between the mid-1860s and the turn of the century had just witnessed an electricity revolution, driven by inventors like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, and George Westinghouse, during which the world went from normal to positively <em>magical</em>. The first magic happened in the middle of the century, when the telegraph used long-range electricity to communicate with people really far away, and in 1866, the first successful cross-Atlantic telegraph message was sent, allowing Europe and the US to magically communicate with each other <em>instantly</em>. The magic revolution hit full force in the late 1870s. The first telephone call happened in 1876, followed by the first time in human history someone could record sound and then play it back, in 1877. Light bulbs began to light up city streets in the early 1880s, and by 1896, the first electrical grid brought widespread electricity into people’s homes. Also in 1896, the first primitive motion picture went on display in New York, and the first wireless transmission of a human voice—the birth of the radio—went through in Brazil in 1900. Meanwhile, magical horseless cars were appearing on the streets, and only a few years later, in 1903, the Wright Brothers would take humanity’s first heavier-than-air flight. It’s hard to imagine how <i>insanely cool </i>a time this must have been for everyone.</p><p>And if you were alive around the year 1900, you’d probably equate modern tech with electricity, much the way we today equate modern tech with computers, smart phones and the internet. Edison and Tesla were their Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. The idea of powering transportation with a fiery engine dated back to the earliest locomotives almost 100 years earlier, which would seem about as modern to a person in 1900 as black-and-white silent films seem to us today. By 1900, you weren’t supposed to have to deal with how the energy sausage is really made anymore—the burning fire happened in some remote generator now, allowing consumers to only have to interact with the silent, clean, convenient magical butler—electricity.</p><p>So if someone in the year 1900 had to bet on the outcome of the battle between external steam combustion, internal gasoline combustion, and electricity as the future standard for powering cars, they’d have probably put their money on electricity. And at the time, electricity was not only winning the battle over gasoline with far more cars on the road, but the world’s most prominent inventors, including Edison and Tesla, were pouring their efforts into an electric car future. Early in the century, the New York Times referred to the electric car as “ideal,” citing it as quieter, cleaner, and more economical than the gas car.<a href=\"#footnote2-25-3667\" id=\"note2-25-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">25</a><p>But <em>ideal</em> wasn’t the driving force of the early auto industry—<em>scalable</em> was. Cars were, up until that point, fairly impractical toys for rich people. There would be time to idealize everything later—the first step was to figure out how to make the car fast, sturdy, and most importantly, affordable. Money and brains poured into car technology from all over the world, and in 1908, Henry Ford and his five-year-old company came out with the car that launched the automotive industry into the stratosphere: The Model T.<a href=\"#footnote2-26-3667\" id=\"note2-26-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">26</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3737 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg\" alt=\"1908-model-t-ford\" width=\"491\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>Before the Model T, there had been big problems with both electric and gas vehicles. Electric had shorter ranges and longer refueling times. Gas cars were loud, hard to start, and spewed smoke like it was 1802.</p><p>But Ford was a masterful industrialist, and by coming up with the concept of making cars by moving assembly line instead of hand-crafting them, he dramatically brought down costs and created America’s first car for the masses. In 1912, engineer Charles Kettering invented the electric car starter, eliminating the need to laboriously and dangerously hand crank your gas car on, and the newly invented muffler significantly reduced gas engine noise. Suddenly, a lot of the things that sucked about gas cars didn’t suck anymore—and they had become much cheaper than electric cars. Ford’s Model T took over America, and by 1914, 99% of new American cars ran on gas. By 1920, electric cars dropped entirely out of commercial production.<a href=\"#footnote2-27-3667\" id=\"note2-27-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">27</a><p>This was not an inevitable outcome. The future of cars had been up for grabs, and Ford had simply outsmarted his competition. Burning fuel was the way of the past and electricity was the way of the future—but Ford had created a provable, profitable business model for making cars, one that didn’t yet exist for electric cars, and it quickly became too much of an uphill battle for electric car makers to try to turn the tide. So they stopped.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Now it’s a century later. The most primitive local telephone call through a wire has become a person in Delhi being able to take a slab of glass out of his pocket, tap it with his finger, and instantly be talking to, and looking at, his friend in Sao Paulo. The grainiest, choppiest black-and-white silent movies have become Pixar. Mixing chemicals in a lab has become splitting atoms in the Large Hadron Collider. The Wright Brothers’ 12 second, 120-foot flight has become routine trips 250 miles up to the International Space Station.</p><p>But instead of me finishing that paragraph with, “The primitive gas-burning car has become [something rad we can’t even imagine],” I have to finish it with, “The primitive gas-burning car has become the better gas-burning car.”</p><p>As I said, if you were alive in 1900, you’d have probably thought the idea of an AC induction electric car motor was awesome and futuristic, and the internal combustion engine, which was only an incremental advance from the early locomotive steam engines invented a century earlier, was kind of cool but not especially futuristic. But we’re not alive in 1900, we’re alive in 2015, so when <em>we </em>look at the modern gas engine that’s in all of our cars, and we see <em>pistons </em>moving back and forth because of something hot exploding inside their cylinders—<a href=\"#footnote2-28-3667\" id=\"note2-28-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">28</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3716 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\" alt=\"img11\" width=\"490\" height=\"347\" /></a></p><p>—they should seem <em>outrageously ancient</em>. Quick aside:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Tim Makes Passionate Car People Even More Furious By Describing How a Car Engine Works in a Clearly-Non-Car-Person Way Blue Box</strong></span></p><p>Welcome to the Tim Makes Passionate Car People Even More Furious By Describing How a Car Engine Works in a Clearly-Non-Car-Person Way Blue Box. Here’s the deal:</p><p>The animation above is of a four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. The four cylinders are those four tubes the pistons are moving up and down inside of. Each time a piston slides up or down, that’s called a stroke, and the fuel-burning happens in a four-stroke cycle:</p><p><strong>1) The Intake Stroke:</strong> This is the part where the piston is moving down and there’s blue stuff above it. The blue stuff is air that’s being sucked in along with a small amount of gasoline that’s fired in at just the right time by the fuel injector.</p><p><strong>2) The Compression Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke where the piston moves up and as it does, the blue stuff turns orange. What’s happening is that the valve that let the air in on the intake stroke has now closed and as the piston moves up, there’s nowhere for the air/gas mixture to go, so it just compresses really tightly.</p><p><strong>3) The Power Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke I feel like passionate car men talk about with a little twinkle in their eye. In the animation, this is where the piston moves down and there’s orange above it which then turns gray by the end. The previous compression stroke has squeezed the air and gas tightly, and at the top of that stroke, the spark plug at the top of the cylinder emits a spark which ignites the compressed air and gas on fire and creates a little explosion. This explosion blows the piston back downwards. This stroke is where the power of the car engine comes from.</p><p><strong>4) The Exhaust Stroke: </strong>This is the part where the piston pushes the gray stuff up and out of the cylinder. The gray stuff is exhaust—i.e. smoke because you just lit a campfire in that cylinder—that then makes its way out of the car’s tailpipe. This smoke consists of mostly non-toxic gases with a little carbon monoxide and other poison mixed in for fun. Also in the exhaust is the carbon dioxide that just got created during the explosion, which allows the long-buried carbon in the gasoline to happily re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere after the most boring 300 million years ever underground.</p><p>The furious back-and-forth motion of the pistons work together to forcefully turn what’s called a crankshaft—that metal bar contraption they’re all connected to below—which creates the turning motion that eventually turns the car’s wheel axles. I think.<a href=\"#footnote-11-3667\" id=\"note-11-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a><p>(For more info: first two minutes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA_19bHxEYg\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> shows this all in action, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W_NRHxekaY\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> is aesthetically pleasing.)</p></div><p>Now. I’ll admit that car engines are cool. And I can see why some people are kind of obsessed with them. But when I look at these two animations next to each other—</p><p><b>1815 locomotive engine:</b></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed1.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3738 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed1.gif\" alt=\"rodsmed\" width=\"399\" height=\"122\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2015 car engine:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3716 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\" alt=\"img11\" width=\"400\" height=\"283\" /></a></p><p><em>—they look</em><em>too similar to be 200 years</em><em>apart.</em></p><p>“Hot explosions in cylinders pushing pistons back and forth to force metal bars to turn wheels and sending the resulting smoke billowing out of a pipe” <em>sounds </em>like an old-fashioned technology, and it’s just very odd that we’re still using it today. We get used to the world we live in, whatever that world is like, but if you examine history and take a big step back, some things suddenly make no sense. And this is one of them.</p><p>So the question we need to ask is why.</p><p>If electric motors were the more advanced technology—if they were considered <em>ideal</em> because they were quiet, clean, and took advantage of cutting edge technology—why did the world give up on them? In 1900, neither electric nor gas cars were viable for mass adoption—both needed a few key technological breakthroughs. The key breakthroughs needed for gas cars happened <em>first</em>—but why was that reason for us to just settle, <em>permanently</em>, for the more primitive technology and the one that, over time, would make our cities smoggy and change the chemical makeup of our atmosphere? If 20th-century human invention could go from the Wright Brothers’ 12-second flight to the moon in just 66 years, surely advancing battery technology enough to bring electric car prices and charging times down while increasing range shouldn’t have been beyond our scope. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why did innovation and progress in something as important to the world as car-powering technology just <em>stop</em>?</span></p><p>This question could be asked about other parts of the bigger story of the Fossil Fuels Era. You could just as easily puzzle over the question, “America’s first electricity power station, Edison’s Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, first lit up in 1882, powered by burning coal—how is it possible that in 2015, burning coal is still by far the primary way humanity produces electricity even though we’ve known for decades that it’s not an optimal or sustainable long-term method?”</p><p>The problem with the question “Why did X technology stop moving forward?” is that it’s misunderstanding how progress works. Instead of asking why technological progress sometimes <em>stops</em>, we have to ask the question:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em>Why does technological progress ever happen at all? </em></span></p><p>The mistake of the first question is the intuitive but incorrect notion that technology naturally moves forward on its own over time—it doesn’t. I can tell you this for sure, because my Time Warner DVR has the exact same horrible user interface it had in 2004. The way technology works is that by default, it stands still, and it moves forward only when something <em>pushes </em>it forward.</p><p>We often have the same intuitive misconception when we think about evolution. Natural selection doesn’t make things “better”—it just optimizes biology to best survive in whatever environmental circumstances it finds itself. When something in that environment changes—a predator mutates and becomes faster, a certain type of food becomes scarce, an ice age rolls in—it means species that were previously optimized to the environment no longer are. The environmental change alters the natural selection criteria, which applies a <em>pressure </em>on the species as it is, and over time, the genetics of the species will react to the pressure by changing in order to optimize to the new environment.</p><p>When it comes to technology, a totally free and open market is the natural environment. But unlike the world of species, which is the eternal Wild West, human societies have another factor in play—a god-type force called government. So if we’re trying to figure out what makes technology move and change, we have to look at <em>two</em> sources of pressure: natural market conditions that ebb and flow and apply continual new pressures on all the actors within, and the “god” on top who can artificially change the environment below to create manufactured pressures. Let’s examine both, starting with government:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) Pressure From Government-Induced Environment Changes</strong></span></p><p>The nature and power of a market’s government-god varies significantly throughout the world. In North Korea, it is a Biblical-style, all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful ruler of the universe to the point where there <em>is</em> no natural market environment—just the one god created and maintains. In Scandinavia, god is a wealthy power mom and the market is nestled in her warm bosom of safety and opportunity. In Central Africa, god made a lifestyle change and got a new job, working for the wealthiest families—huge step up the ladder for him.</p><p>In the US, god has an identity crisis, alternating between feelings of pride and self-loathing. It wants to have the best country, but it’s standing on the street corner alone yelling out in an argument with itself about the right way to do that. When the US government (or a government like it) wants to play god and alter the American natural market environment to apply certain pressures in certain places, it uses three main tools: funding, regulation, and taxes.</p><p><strong>Funding: </strong>In order for government funding to lead to major progress, there has to be a lot of it, and in an open democracy, that only flies when the nation needs to do something so important that everyone agrees on it—like in the 1960s, when the fear of losing global influence kicked the US government’s adrenaline in and it put a man on the moon. Likewise, significant US military funding is something the American electorate can agree on enough that it receives tremendous funding and plays an important part in advancing technology in a number of industries. In most cases, though, a divided democracy is too paralyzed by conflicting interests and political squabbling to be the main driver of a serious tech revolution.</p><p><strong>Regulation: </strong>Another democratic government muscle is its ability to make rules—laws, restrictions, quotas, etc. These can be effective at pushing through minor changes—the seatbelt and airbag are both products of government regulation. But at least when it comes to the car industry, I’m having a hard time thinking of instances of major technological <em>leaps</em> caused by government regulation.</p><p><strong>Tax Code: </strong>The government often uses the tax code to add its own economic pressures into the free market. Again though, while this can be effective for <em>nudging </em>something in a certain direction, it doesn’t tend to lead to sweeping advances.</p><p>Of course, America is in a big fight about this, with fiscal liberals typically feeling a lot more optimistic about government’s ability to play a positive role in moving things forward than fiscal conservatives. But I think both would agree that major tech progress being <em>forced </em>forward<em> </em>by the government is more the way of places like the Soviet Union and modern-day China where government has a lot more power. The incredible innovation that often emerges from open democracies tends to come from pressures from below, in the bubbling cauldron of the free market—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) Pressures From Natural Market Forces</strong> </span></p><p>In the natural world, to catch food and stay away from predators, animals will optimize by becoming fast and elusive runners. When food on the ground becomes scarce, species will feel the pressure of hunger and over time, their genetics will re-optimize by developing good bodies for climbing or long necks or wings. A running species that becomes a flying species hasn’t become <em>better—</em>just better fit for the current circumstances. In the world of species, the definition of optimization is simple because the end goals are simple: the core needs of biological creatures are always the same—to self-preserve and reproduce. So optimization in the natural world always has the same definition: to adjust in a way that makes you mostly likely to self-preserve and reproduce.</p><p>In order to understand what optimization means in the market, we need to know what the core goals are of the actors there. Of course, people are also biological creatures, and self-preservation will always be at the top of the list—if you’re hungry, cold, or sick, fixing that will be the core goal. But for people whose base needs are being met, what are the yearning desires that then lie at the core of their motivation? What does “pursuing your self-interest” mean for them?</p><p>Well, it depends on the culture. In certain cultures, the fear of failure is so strong that it outweighs desires like glory or great fortune, and the primary inner drive becomes to just make sure you’re passable. In others, the deepest drive of the people might be religious salvation, community or family service, a leisurely lifestyle, or spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>When it comes to technological advancement, those motivations aren’t likely to get you there because thinking up tech innovations isn’t a helpful step on the path to optimization for those people. So if we want tech progress, what kind of yearning do we want people to feel?</p><p>I think the ideal mix is a two-part cocktail:</p><p><strong>First ingredient: Greed. </strong>In a perfect, fair, open market, greed works great as the core lifeblood motivation. The way capitalism theoretically works is that the more real-world value you create, the more money you’ll make. So companies in a competitive landscape will put their effort into creating better and better products and services in order to optimize, which for them means making as much money as they possibly can. Individual people are greedy as a means to all kinds of ends—a lavish lifestyle, personal freedom, security, admiration, power, sex—but <em>what</em> they want is irrelevant. As long as their burning desire makes them <em>really want stuff</em>, their drive to optimize will move technology forward. Greed is a double-edged sword though—to be beneficial, greed has to be contained inside a high-integrity, meritocratic, free market. If it’s not, greed will turn into the enemy of progress, because the more vulnerable the system is to corruption, the more the greedy on top will be able to game the system to ensure their own long-lasting victory.</p><p><strong>Second ingredient: Raging ambition.</strong> Greed can lead to steady forward progress, but in order for progress to <em>leap </em>forward, a second ingredient is usually key: a burning desire to do something great. Again, the underlying reasons for this kind of ambition can vary. Sometimes it’ll be an ego-driven desire—to be famous and renowned, to leave one’s mark, to be thought of and posthumously remembered as <em>great</em>. Other times the ambition will be fueled by a borderline-insane level of confidence and optimism that gives someone the gall to be idealistic. These are the yearnings of the <em>hungry underdog. </em></p><p>An established industry full of existing winners running on greed is like the highest layer of trees in a crowded rainforest. They’ll push upward only as needed, elbowing each other for little gains and victories as they vie for sunlight, mostly just trying to keep their spot in the canopy. Greed just wants sunlight—it doesn’t care how high up it is when it gets it.</p><p>But below, the hungry underdog <em>burns</em> for sunlight and will spend 100 hours a week trying to figure out how to get it. When the breakthrough comes, the underdog <em>bursts </em>up through the canopy into the open sky and spreads its leaves out wide. Suddenly, the trees that had been on top are blocked from the sun. Greed is then replaced by the much more powerful drive of <i>survival</i>, and innovation kicks into high gear as they scramble upwards for their life. The environment has changed—it’s been <i>disrupted</i>—and in this new world, created by the underdog disruptor, companies have to innovate in order to re-optimize. Some end up back on top, others die—and at the end of it all, technology has jolted forward. We all witnessed an example of this when Apple rocketed through the mobile phone canopy in 2007 and forced all of the other companies to make a smartphone or die. Samsung managed to get itself back into the sun. Nokia did not.</p><p>With all this in mind, let’s go back to the car industry and our original question:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Why hasn’t the car technology forest moved upward over the past century?</strong> </span></p><p>I see two primary reasons:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) Insanely high barriers to entry—so no leaps forward caused by hungry underdogs</strong></span></p><p>Try to think of something ickier and harder than starting a car company.</p><p>First, before you can sell one product, you’ll need to put down an absurd amount of capital to buy a factory, figure out how to design a car and all of its parts, build a prototype, use that to raise a lot more money, get a much bigger factory and hire thousands of people, and pump many millions of dollars into marketing to tell the world that your company exists. And you probably need to be incredibly rich and risk-tolerant yourself since very few people are zany enough to invest money in a startup car company.</p><p>Second, in order to be profitable, you have to sell at a high volume. Cars are too expensive to make and margins are too thin to only sell a few each year. So for this to be a good idea, you not only have to create an awesome car, but one that a ton of people will want to buy.</p><p>Third, gas cars are already well-optimized—if you want to aggressively burst through the canopy like an underdog without any brand awareness needs to, you have to create a <em>much better type of car than what’s out there</em>. In the case of cars, that probably means addressing the core of the car itself and the thing that’s been stressing everyone out with its billowing emissions—the engine. But since no one has really done this yet, it means you need to not only create the first successful startup car company in a long time, you need to create the first startup to <em>ever </em>succeed at making whatever type of car you’re creating. And since you’ll be there first to do it, you’ll have to put a huge amount of time and money into innovation research and development and bear the brunt of the invention costs for the whole industry. You’ll also have to bear the marketing costs to educate the world on why they should want this new type of car—that’s a one-time expense and once it’s done, other companies will be able to ride on the consumer demand you spent a ton of money building.</p><p>So it’s not surprising that the last successful startup car company in America was Chrysler in 1925—90 years ago. It’s basically an impossible endeavor.</p><p>And without any threat from below on the forest floor—from the wild innovation of scrappy entrepreneurs with nothing to lose—the car industry has had the luxury of calmly sunbathing in a tight canopy quilt, making only incremental advances, only when they’re needed. But there’s a problem here too—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) A glitch in the car market separates car company optimization from what’s best for the world.</strong></span></p><p>As I mentioned above, greed works nicely as an optimization criterion <em>if </em>the market is perfect—open, accurate, and fair.</p><p>Greedy companies will make their decisions based on whatever the best way is to optimize to their environment—i.e. How can we make the most possible money? But a company’s drive for maximum money is only beneficial to society when the company’s profit is tightly and accurately correlated with the amount of net positive value its product or service provides to society.</p><p>If I start a lemonade stand, every time I give someone a delicious cup of lemonade, they’ll be likely to recommend me to their friends and become a recurring customer. I provided positive value and my business’s success went up with it.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">Value Provided<span style=\"color: #000000;\">.</span></span> </strong>Incentives are aligned.</p><p>If another customer comes to the stand and I give him a cup of lemonade with a fly in it, he won’t come back and he’ll tell his friends not to go—I caused harm and my success went down.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">[Value Provided]</span> – <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[Harm Caused]</span>. </strong>Incentives still aligned.</p><p>But what if I then discover a chemical I can spray on my lemonade that prevents flies from landing on it. The chemical is tasteless, but I know that drinking it regularly will cause customers immense harm a few decades down the road. Customers won’t experience the harm in the present, so it won’t affect their opinion of my lemonade or the success of my business.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">[Value Provided]</span> – <del><span style=\"color: #808080;\">[Harm Caused]</span></del></strong><b>. </b></p><p>The harm caused is now an <em>unaccounted-for cost</em>, also known as a negative externality, and my incentives are no longer aligned with the customer’s best interests. If all I care about is greed and maximizing profit, I will continue to use the chemical, because I’m economically incentivized to do so.</p><p>This kind of negative externality is how tobacco companies got away with murder for so many decades. The long-term cost to customers’ health was unaccounted for because customers were ignorant to the consequences, the negative effects were years away, and there was no regulatory penalty in place to charge for the harm. Thinking purely from a greed-optimizing perspective, cigarette companies acted completely rationally. They kicked up nicotine levels in cigarettes and added shards of glass into filters to create tiny cuts and increase nicotine absorption, which caused further harm but increased demand—but since the harm was unaccounted for, this was a pure net positive for the company. And when anti-tobacco campaigns started to educate customers on cigarette harm—which attaches the harm to the cost of scared customers and lower demand—the tobacco industry hired low-integrity scientists to discredit the negative campaigns and muddle the message. Awareness would get there eventually, but the longer they could delay and keep the harm hidden, the better off they’d be from a greed standpoint.</p><p>People call this evil, but all it really is is an industry acting in its own best interests within the parameters of its environment. Greed is a simple motivation—it takes whatever it can get, and it’ll push all available limits it can in order to fully optimize. I used tobacco companies as an example, but you could easily tell the story with fast food, radiation-emitting consumer electronics, politician behavior, the finance industry, and many others.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In the auto industry, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the negative externality.</span> If you have a cheap and easy way to build cars that dump garbage into the atmosphere and no one makes you pay for it, why would you ever change anything?</p><p>It’s the same story as cigarettes. Instead of the tobacco industry and the cigarette companies who support it, you have the oil industry and the car companies who support it. Instead of short-term emphysema, you have short term city smog. Instead of long-term harm to people’s health like lung cancer, you have long-term harm to the human way of life like underwater coastal cities.</p><p>A lot of people have written about the hidden cost of carbon emissions, and many of them, on <a href=\"http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">both</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/opinion/paul-krugman-conservatives-and-climate-change.html\" target=\"_blank\">sides</a> of the political spectrum, have proposed a logical solution: <strong>a revenue-neutral carbon tax.</strong></p><p>A revenue-neutral carbon tax is revenue-neutral because any increase in government revenue as a result of the tax would be offset by an equal decrease in something else like income taxes. This makes it a politically moot proposal.</p><p>The tax could be applied at any point along the supply chain from oil extraction to the gas pump and the effect would be the same—it would either become more expensive to drive a gas car, less profitable to be in the business of gas, or both. With a carbon tax in place, when you’re contributing to the carbon problem, you’re also paying for it—which incentivizes consumers and companies to explore alternatives. This wouldn’t be the government meddling in the market—it would be the government fixing a glitch in the market.</p><p class=\"p1\">Instead, the government offers tax breaks to people for buying an electric vehicle and subsidies for the renewable energy industry, which is like a town full of businesses who throw their trash in the street, and the government reacting by paying businesses to stop doing that, instead of just charging businesses for doing it. Other times, the government tries to force emissions downwards by forcing car companies to create a minimum number of zero-emissions cars—with limited effect. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton both tried this, to some extent, and both times the next president (Reagan and Bush) removed the regulations upon taking office (ironically, the Clinton mandate for more hybrid cars accomplished nothing in the US, but it scared the shit out of Toyota, who began furiously innovating and created the Prius). Another time, in 1990, the California government tried to institute its own zero-emissions regulations, which the car and oil companies fought until they finally bullied California out of it and the regulations were removed in 2003.<a href=\"#footnote-12-3667\" id=\"note-12-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a> The problem is, giant companies have enough influence that any government attempt at making changes through regulation ends up being watered down to the point where it’s ineffective.</p><p class=\"p1\">When it comes to a carbon tax, the only explanation for not having one seems to be the power big oil has over the US government—because to me, it seems like every politician in either party should be in favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Right?</p><p>Without any negative consequence of emitting carbon, optimizing for greed pushes certain car technologies forward, like safety, comfort, and drive quality, because getting high safety and quality ratings is tied to demand—but it <em>doesn’t</em> change anything about carbon emissions, because the greed equation doesn’t currently include that cost.</p><p>So the reason why, 112 years after Ford Motor Company’s founding, we’re still using harmful, old-fashioned engines is simple: none of the pressures on the car industry are pushing it to change. The car industry still needs to work hard to optimize in <em>certain</em> areas—that’s why cars have become safer, smoother, more comfortable, and more efficient over the years. But the most glaring flaw of the modern car—that it constantly dumps garbage into the atmosphere—remains untouched, because doing so is free, because big oil’s influence means government keeps allowing it, and because there’s no one from underneath to burst through the canopy and show customers that there’s a better way.</p><p>It’s scary. Something really, terribly bad might be happening that could make our actual lives legitimately worse in the future, but we have a prisoner’s dilemma on our hands—it’s much, much better for all of us collectively to make a change, but for <em>each individual </em>CEO, lobbyist, or politician, there’s more to <em>personally </em>gain from maintaining the status quo. People like to say, “this is the world our children will live in and we’re botching it for them,” but for the people with the power to change something, their <em>particular</em> children will be best off if they make the most money possible. The situation is stuck.</p><p>A deeply-set, stagnant industry is like a country led by a deeply-entrenched dynasty—it’s hard to penetrate the status quo. But even in the case of the most powerful caste systems, sometimes the right person comes along at the right time and starts the right movement, and a revolution can ignite.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part3\"></a>Part 3: The Story of Tesla</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3781\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png\" alt=\"Story of Tesla\" width=\"182\" height=\"182\" /></a></p><p>Christie Nicholson remembers meeting Elon Musk for the first time at a party back in 1989.</p><p>“I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was ‘I think a lot about electric cars,’” Christie said. “And then he turned to me and said, ‘Do you think about electric cars?’”<a href=\"#footnote-13-3667\" id=\"note-13-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a><p>Electric cars seems like an odd thing to spend your time thinking about in 1989. To understand why Musk felt so strongly about them, let’s start by understanding what electric cars are and how they work.</p><p>There are a handful of common modern types of cars considered greener than traditional gas cars—namely hybrid cars, plug-in hybrid cars, and electric cars (which we’ll call EVs for “electric vehicles”). There’s also a lot of talk about another type—hydrogen fuel cell cars, which we’ll just call hydrogen cars. The one thing these cars all have in common is an electric motor.</p><p>There are two types of electric motors—the AC induction motor and the brushless DC electric motor. Since 98% of people reading this aren’t licking their lips to read a three-paragraph description of the difference, let it suffice to say that they’re the same basic idea:</p><p>An electric motor is a <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/432632095_8b49ad80ba.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">pig in a blanket</a> where electricity is sent into the outer bread part (called the stator), which is always stationary, and that electric current causes the hot dog part (called the rotor) to rotate. The rotor is attached to the wheel axle which turns the wheels. Like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-29-3667\" id=\"note2-29-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">29</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3696 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif\" alt=\"indhvtuiction\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><b>How an AC Induction Motor Works Blue Box</b></span></p><p>One of the two common types of electric motor is the AC induction motor (that’s what Tesla cars use). AC stands for alternating current,<a href=\"#footnote-14-3667\" id=\"note-14-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a> and induction means there’s no physical contact between the rotor and the stator—electricity in the stator generates a rotating magnetic field which enters the rotor through electrical induction and causes it to spin.</p><p>The stator generates a rotating magnetic field by sending electricity through it in a three phase system:<a href=\"#footnote2-30-3667\" id=\"note2-30-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">30</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3698 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif\" alt=\"inductionmotoranimation\" width=\"513\" height=\"342\" /></a></p><p>So there are three different wires each with an alternating back-and-forth pull—just look at any one color and you’ll see it’s just going back and forth. But the three wires’ currents are staggered in just the right way that the point of “pull” in the stator rotates in a smooth circle. When the rotor is added in, this rotating magnetic field causes it to spin:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3697 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif\" alt=\"generatoranimation\" width=\"485\" height=\"323\" /></a></p><p>The idea is that the rotor can never quite catch up to where it wants to be—it’s always “chasing” the rotor’s field, and that chase is what powers the car. The AC induction motor was invented by Nikola Tesla, and that’s why Tesla Motors is named after him.<a href=\"#footnote-15-3667\" id=\"note-15-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></div><p>Here are the types of cars that use an electric motor:</p><p><strong>Hybrids </strong>(also called HEVs for hybrid electric vehicles), like the Toyota Prius, have both an electric motor <em>and </em>an internal combustion engine. You don’t plug a hybrid car in—the gas charges the battery. The battery also gets charge from an electric motor trick called regenerative braking. Normally, all the joules of kinetic energy a car is harnessing when it’s moving are lost when the car brakes and they’re just converted into heat. With regenerative braking, electric cars send some of that kinetic energy back into the battery, holding onto those joules to be used again later. The electric component of a hybrid replaces some of the need to burn gas, increasing the miles per gallon, decreasing the car’s emissions, and saving the driver gas money. Hybrids are a big step up in technology from normal gas cars.</p><p>But they still kind of suck. Why? Because they’re only kind of helping the emissions problem, not solving it, and they still need to burn gas to work. As I’ve heard people say, a world 100% full of Prius drivers is still a world 100% addicted to oil.</p><p><strong>Plug-in hybrids </strong>(also called PHEVs) are a better option. Plug-in hybrid cars, like the Chevy Volt, the Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid, and the Ford Fusion Energi, allow you to charge the battery at home and typically drive 10-40 miles just on battery power before the gas kicks in. That’s often enough to get most people through most of their day, meaning they may rarely need to use gas.</p><p>But if we’re gonna get <em>so close</em>, why not just go all the way?</p><p><strong>Hydrogen cars </strong>are entirely electric—but they don’t use a battery. Instead, they fill up with fuel at a station just like a gas car—except they fill up with compressed hydrogen, not gas. The hydrogen mixes with oxygen in the air to produce electricity, which it sends to the motor to power the car. They produce no tailpipe emissions because the only byproduct is clean water. Sounds great, right?</p><p>Musk, for the life of him, cannot understand how anyone could make an argument in favor of hydrogen cars,<a href=\"#footnote-16-3667\" id=\"note-16-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> but it’s confusing because lots of car companies, like Toyota, Honda, and General Motors, are currently pouring big investments into making hydrogen cars. I wanted to understand the disagreement, so I read like 12 articles in favor and opposed to the technology. At the end of it, I’m having a hard time seeing why hydrogen cars would have a more promising future than electric vehicles. For those who want details, here’s a footnote.<a href=\"#footnote-17-3667\" id=\"note-17-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a><p>Finally, there are <strong>electric cars, or</strong><strong>EVs</strong>, like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Ford Focus Electric, and the Tesla Model S.<strong> </strong>These are simple—there’s a big battery, which you charge, and it powers the electric motor. No liquid involved.</p><p>Now, in <em>theory</em>, EVs make a lot of sense. Forgetting the rest of the car for a second, let’s look at some of the advantages of the electric motor over the internal combustion gas engine:</p><p><strong>Electric motors are more convenient than gas engines most of the time. </strong>Gas cars have to go to the gas station; EV owners plug their car in every night the same way they charge their phone—no stopping for gas. A gas engine is a lot more complicated than an electric motor, with over 200 parts; an electric motor has fewer than 10. A gas engine requires a transmission, a tailpipe, gears, and a bunch of other grease-covered shit; an EV has none of those things—when you open the hood, it’s more storage space, like the trunk. Gas engines need oil, which means they need oil changes; EVs don’t. The extra complexity means gas cars end up needing a lot more maintenance than EVs.</p><p><strong>It costs a lot less to power an electric motor than a gas engine. </strong>The extra costs gas car owners incur for oil changes and car repairs aside, the gas engine’s fuel—gas—is much more expensive than the electric motor’s fuel—electricity. Let’s look at the math:</p><p>The average electric car gets about 3 miles per kWh<a href=\"#footnote-18-3667\" id=\"note-18-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> of electricity, and the US national average electricity rate is 12 cents per kWh. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">That means that driving a mile in an electric car costs about 4 cents. </span></p><p>The cost of driving a gas car is harder, because gas prices and car fuel efficiency widely vary. The best case scenario for a gas car is unusually cheap gas (let’s say $1.40/gallon) coupled with unusually high fuel efficiency (let’s say it’s a rare gas car that gets 35 mpg). That would produce the same 4 cents/mile that electric cars get. But very few gas car owners ever pay 4 cents/mile. Without being crazy extreme, for the worse case scenario, let’s say a high $4.00/gallon gas and a below-average 15 mpg—in that case, a mile in a gas car costs 27 cents per mile. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">At a pretty typical 12,000 miles/year, that means at absolute best, gas is tied with electric for cost, and at worst, it costs over $3,000/year more to drive on gas.</span></p><p><strong>The gas engine is one of the two major causes of the energy/climate crisis. </strong>We’ve already discussed this—transportation burning oil makes up a third of the world emissions, pollutes cities, and makes nations over-dependent on other nations. The electric motor emits nothing. Yes, it may run on electricity that was produced in a dirty way—but we’ll get to that later.</p><p>So that’s why Musk told Christie Nicholson that he thinks a lot about electric cars. The electric motor is clearly the easier, cheaper, and more sensible long-term plan for powering cars.</p><p>But when the electric motor made its first appearance over 100 years ago, there were serious drawbacks that prevented it from becoming the norm—and since electric cars went out of production back then, little time or money has been spent trying to fix those issues. There tend to be three age-old concerns about the viability of the electric car:</p><p><strong>EV Concern 1) Range. </strong>This is really three issues rolled into one:</p><p>A) Will the battery life be too short for long drives, limiting an EV to a car only for local driving?</p><p>B) If I’m out and about and need to recharge my battery on the road, is there anywhere to do it? Or will I end up stranded?</p><p>C) If I do find a charging station while on the road, will I have to sit there for five hours while it charges?</p><p>These issues are such a prevalent concern among potential EV-owners that they have their own term: range anxiety.</p><p><b>EV Concern 2) Performance. </b>The most common electric vehicle you’ll see around today is the golf cart. Which doesn’t excite car owners very much. No one wants a car that drives like shit, and when people think about zooming acceleration, they tend to think about powerful gas engines, not electric motors.</p><p><strong>EV Concern 3) Price. </strong>Ever since the beginning, EVs have cost more than gas cars, mainly because of the high cost of the battery.</p><p>Back in 1910, people cited these exact same three concerns over electric cars, and they’re part of the reason gas cars won the day. Gas cars had had their own major problems, but Ford had figured out how to make them viable—something no one has yet done for the electric car.</p><p>I asked Musk about his opinion on Henry Ford. He said, “Ford was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn’t know what they needed.”</p><p>When he decided in 2003 to stop thinking about electric cars and start making them, the odds weren’t in Musk’s favor. There were the high barriers to entry that had prevented any startup car company from succeeding in almost a century; there was the unaccounted for cost of carbon emissions, which made starting an EV company like trying to stand out on a basketball court as a rookie when all the players except you can foul with no penalty; there was the gargantuan oil industry, which would do everything in its power to stomp on any effort to make it obsolete; and on top of that, the EV was a new kind of car whose development had essentially been on pause ever since EV makers threw in the towel a century earlier, and a daunting and costly catch-up process would lay ahead—the three concerns listed above would all need to somehow be addressed for this to have a chance.</p><p>The overarching question was, had electric cars never had their day because of irreconcilable issues? Or had the right person—the Henry Ford of EVs—just not come along yet?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Car companies aren’t supposed to start in Silicon Valley, and Silicon Valley startups aren’t supposed to make cars.</p><p>But the electric car industry is not your grandfather’s car industry. And in 2003, it wasn’t anyone’s car industry. After the brief bubble of new electric cars in California in the 1990s between the year the state passed the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate and the year they were bullied into repealing it, the electric car industry had withered into the oblivion of the scattered California garages and tech labs of car geeks. But big things have emerged out of small groups of cutting-edge California geek labs. Apple. Microsoft. Google. So why not the modern electric car industry?</p><p>One of these little car technology companies was AC Propulsion, and while carmakers in Detroit, Tokyo, and Munich continued to not realize that electric cars were clearly the future, the guys at AC Propulsion were experimenting away, quietly making one giant EV breakthrough after another.</p><p>One day last week, I cold called AC Propulsion and accosted their CTO, Paul Carosa, who had been there since the beginning. He was too polite to figure out how to get off the phone with me, so he told me about those years in the late 90s and early 2000s when they created their fanciest car to date—the tzero (pronounced t-zero). AC Propulsion had figured out two huge things:</p><p>First, the tzero was <em>fast—</em>it went 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds, which was crazy fast for an electric car and put it on par with the fast gas cars.</p><p>Second, they had made big progress on an enormous EV shortcoming by getting innovative with the battery. Previous EVs had used lead-acid batteries, which were heavy and limited. AC Propulsion realized that the laptop and mobile phone industry had been pouring development into making small 18650 lithium-ion batteries increasingly efficient, and that those batteries had gotten <em>really</em><em> </em>advanced. 18650 batteries look like AA batteries, which seems like an odd match for a car, but by lining up a few <em>thousand </em>of them in a big battery case, they had just created by <em>far </em>the world’s best ever car battery. EVs had always been limited to a 60 or 80 or <em>maybe</em> a 120-mile range. The tzero could go 250 miles on a single charge.</p><p>In 2003, a California engineer named JB Straubel was then tinkering around with EVs himself, met Musk to ask for funding for a car project he was working on. Soon after that, Straubel brought Musk by the AC Propulsion office to see the tzero. Musk was blown away. Musk had suspected for a while that EVs were the way of the future, and now that he saw the possibilities with his own eyes, he was convinced.</p><p>At the time, he was already running SpaceX and trying to colonize Mars, so launching a startup car company wasn’t something he could really fit into his calendar. He really wanted the world to see the tzero because he was sure it would excite people and help to stoke a new wave of EV interest—and he tried to convince the AC Propulsion guys to bring the tzero to market, with his funding, but they didn’t want to deal with that because it sounded icky. Instead, AC Propulsion introduced Musk to a group of three other entrepreneurs who had also recently approached them with a similar idea and had also been rebuffed. Those three guys, who included Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, had come up with the idea of licensing AC Propulsion’s technology and bringing it to market themselves as a new company called Tesla Motors<a href=\"#footnote-19-3667\" id=\"note-19-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a>—but to make any of this real, they needed money. It was a perfect match, so they decided to make a run at it together. Musk, who could only dedicate part time to the project, could fund the effort, become Chairman and maintain a strong influence, but by making Eberhard CEO, he could focus on SpaceX with the bulk of his time. And Tesla was on its way.</p><p>The group formed a team and started figuring out how to be a car company. One big problem they had was that this was a new technology, and the R&amp;D costs early on for a new technology drive up the price of the product—that’s the same reason the very first cell phones and computers started out really expensive. Except in those cases, they were the first of their kind, so the product could be super expensive and still sell. Because perfectly good, affordable gas cars already exist, it wouldn’t work to come out with the equivalent quality of a $25,000 gas car for $100,000+. So this became the business plan:</p><p><strong>Step 1: High-priced, low-volume car for the super rich.</strong> Come out with the expensive first product, but make the car so fancy that it’s worth that price—i.e. just make it a legit Ferrari competitor and then it’s okay to charge over $100,000 for it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Mid-priced, mid-volume car for the pretty rich. </strong>Use the profits from Step 1 to develop the Step 2 car. It would still be expensive, but more like a $75,000 Mercedes or BMW competitor instead of Ferrari.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Low-priced, high-volume car for the masses. </strong>Use the profits from Step 2 to develop a $35,000-ish car that, after the government’s $7,500 EV tax credit and the savings on gas, would be affordable to the middle class.</p><p>It’s kind of a Hershey’s Kiss business plan:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3791\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png\" alt=\"pyramid\" width=\"527\" height=\"397\" /></a></p><p>The overarching mission wasn’t to build the biggest car company in the world. It was to solve a bunch of long-standing EV shortcomings and build such an insanely great car that it could change everyone’s perception of what an EV could be and force the world’s big car companies to have to develop their own line of great EVs. Their end goal, and the company’s official mission, was “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” In other words, EVs are gonna happen, but we’re gonna make them happen a lot <em>sooner</em>. Sooner, in this case, is important, because it means carbon emissions decrease earlier and the long term effects of them are much less damaging.</p><p>So they got working. And four years later, they had their Step 1 car, the<strong> Roadster:</strong><a href=\"#footnote2-31-3667\" id=\"note2-31-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">31</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3739 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla1\" width=\"506\" height=\"337\" /></a></p><p>With the Roadster, Tesla wasn’t trying to make their long term car (one Tesla employee told me that from the beginning, Musk would make sure everyone knew that the company’s long-term mission “was <em>not</em> to make toys for rich people.”) They just wanted to build something awesome to A) show the world how great an EV could be, and B) generate revenue to develop their Step 2 car. So they didn’t start from scratch on the body design, instead basing it on a Lotus Elise.</p><p>The Roadster didn’t change the world—no $110,000 car ever could—but it sent a message to the industry that Tesla was for real. You may not have heard of the Roadster when it was announced in 2006 or when it started shipping in 2008, but some of the major car companies took notice—Nissan soon launched the all-electric Leaf and GM launched the plug-in electric Chevy Volt soon after the Roadster’s appearance (Bob Lutz, who was Chairman of GM at the time, openly credits Tesla for their decision to make the Volt, saying that after the Roadster unveiling, he went to the GM board and asked, “If a little company in California can do this, why can’t we?”).</p><p>But there were some pretty big problems with the first product. Finishing the car was taking way longer than planned, the cost of making each Roadster was way higher than planned, and the early shipments often had defects. This made Musk sad, so he and the board fired Eberhard as CEO, which made Eberhard sad.<a href=\"#footnote-20-3667\" id=\"note-20-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a> Just as this was going down, the most inconvenient thing ever happened—the 2008 recession—which made the entire car industry sad, but especially Tesla, who didn’t yet have brand recognition and wasn’t yet profitable because of all the upfront investment they had been pouring in. A crippling recession is never helpful, but it was <em>really, really </em>bad timing for Tesla.</p><p>Musk had hired a second CEO, but a year in, in late 2008, the company was in one of those movie scenes where the person’s been badly wounded and clearly about to die and there’s this dramatic dialogue scene and the dying person is saying some last words and every time they pause for a second the audience is like, “Is that it? Are they dead? Oh no they just talked again I guess there’s one more line.” Musk, who wasn’t enjoying the drama of the scene, finally was like, “PAUSE THE MOVIE QUICKLY PAUSE IT PAUSE IT” and took over as CEO,<a href=\"#footnote-21-3667\" id=\"note-21-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a>going into full adrenaline mode to try to keep the company alive. And as mentioned in the last post, SpaceX was in the same movie at the same time playing the same role, so Musk’s life was like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3772\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png\" alt=\"S-T\" width=\"550\" height=\"342\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But enough people had been impressed enough by Tesla that a couple key investments at critical moments came in and kept the company alive, and at the end of the whole mess, Tesla was now a new company. Musk was CEO, and the Jonathan Ive of the car industry, star car designer Franz von Holzhausen, who had been the Design Director at GM and then Mazda, had decided to bet his career on the barely-standing Tesla and became their chief designer.</p><p>A few weeks ago, when I stepped into the Tesla design studio to meet von Holzhausen, I was excited to meet the uber-flamboyant diva celebrity car designer, just hoping I would understand what he was saying through his unbelievably thick German accent—and was horribly disappointed to meet an extremely normal-acting American man.</p><p>The studio, which I described in the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">last post</a>, is a shiny playroom of art and physics. Von Holzhausen showed me a full-size clay car that was simultaneously testing two different possible designs for the upcoming Model 3 by making the two halves of the model different. He explained how precise everything about car design is and how “a difference of a quarter millimeter can spread itself across the entire car.”</p><p>I asked him what it was like to come to Tesla after having spent years at more established car companies. He described the difference like this: “A company like GM is a finance-driven company who always has to live up to financial expectations. Here we look at it the other way around—the product is successful when it’s great, and the company becomes great because of that.” (This mirrored what Musk had told me earlier in the day: “The moment the person leading a company thinks numbers have value in themselves, the company’s done. The moment the CFO becomes CEO—it’s done. Game over.”) Von Holzhausen went on, saying, “Another difference is that at other companies, engineering comes first—a design package is prescribed on the designer and they’re told to make it beautiful. At Tesla, design and engineering are assigned equal value, and Elon keeps them opposed to each other.” Now that von Holzhausen has gotten used to his freedom to be obsessed with the product at Tesla, he says he “would dread to go back to pre-historic ways.”</p><p>Von Holzhausen’s first mission at Tesla was to design their Step 2 car—the mid-priced, mid-volume one—that would be called the<strong> Model S</strong>. The Roadster was based on existing design and was a springboard for the company more than a long-term product. The Model S would be Tesla’s first flagship product, and it was their chance to reinvent the concept of a car, from scratch. Von Holzhausen said, “When we started Model S, it was a clean sheet of paper.”</p><p>This all sounded uncannily similar to how Steve Jobs had done things at Apple. He obsessed over making “insanely great products,” and he never paid attention to what other companies were doing, always coming at things from a clean sheet of paper perspective. When Apple decided to make a phone, they didn’t try to make a better Blackberry—they asked, “What should a mobile phone be?”</p><p>Over time, big industries tend to get flabby and uncreative and risk-averse—and if the right outsider company has the means and creativity to come at the industry with a fresh perspective and rethink the whole thing, there’s often a huge opportunity there.</p><p>When the iPhone came out, it turned the phone industry on its head. So should we be surprised that when the Tesla Model S came out, Consumer Reports <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/04/consumer-reports-10-top-picks-of-2015/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anointed it</a> the best car that had ever been made with an unheard of 99/100 rating, and that Tesla owners are <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/In-Gear/2014/1205/Tesla-Model-S-leads-the-pack-in-customer-satisfaction.-Again.\" target=\"_blank\">across-the-board</a> obsessed with the car? No, because it’s like the iPhone—it’s a 15-year leap into the future.<a href=\"#footnote2-32-3667\" id=\"note2-32-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3830\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg\" alt=\"6667\" width=\"600\" height=\"367\" /></a></p><p>The Model S is the fastest 4-door sedan in history, with 3.2-second 0-60 time. It saves battery power by being insanely aerodynamic with the industry’s lowest drag coefficient (.24). A bunch of engineering innovations have combined to give it the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/tesla-model-s-highest-safety-rating/\" target=\"_blank\">highest NHTSA safety rating</a> of any car ever tested by the US government, 5.4 stars.</p><p>The Model S is already <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=EJmhpgW0Dmc\" target=\"_blank\">driving itself</a> and soon, it’ll be able to drive itself to meet you out in the driveway in the morning with the temperature already set and the right music on; at night, you’ll be able to pull up to the house and just get out of the car and the car will park itself into the garage and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2894345/Tesla-teases-electric-car-plugs-charge-Elon-Musk-describes-metal-snake-automatically-connects-vehicles.html\" target=\"_blank\">plug itself in</a>. They did away with model years (i.e. the 2014 Toyota Camry, the 2015 Toyota Camry, etc.), so instead of holding all the year’s new features until the new release, they just put features in as they go. Someone who buys a Tesla today might have a slightly different car than someone who bought one two weeks ago. And they’re constantly rolling out fixes and new features through automatic wifi software updates—owners often wake up in the morning to discover the car has a new capability.</p><p>In a bunch of cases, Tesla has wanted to do something that wasn’t technically possible with the current world or industry limitations—so they’d build what they needed to build to change those limitations:</p><p>The Tesla battery is heavy and they wanted to make the body super light to offset some of that weight—so they turned to SpaceX and used its advanced rocket technology to make Tesla the only North American car with an all aluminum body.</p><p>Musk and von Holzhausen’s<a href=\"#footnote-22-3667\" id=\"note-22-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a> team had spent all this time perfecting the design of the car before it was time to put the door handles on, and they got really used to it that way. When it was time for handles, they didn’t want to ruin how it was, so they figured out how to make the handles lay <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIU73kK7ZUk\" target=\"_blank\">flush</a> with the door.</p><p>They didn’t like the dealership model and wanted to sell directly to customers, but many states don’t allow that, so one by one, they’re <a href=\"http://my.teslamotors.com/fr_CH/forum/forums/where-can-tesla-sell-cars\" target=\"_blank\">fighting</a> the states that won’t and slowly overturning direct car sales bans.</p><p>They wanted to get rid of buttons altogether and have all controls on a huge, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVsHEZivqm8\" target=\"_blank\">17″ touchscreen</a>—but when their first car came out, there was no iPad yet, and 17″ touchscreens suitable for a car didn’t exist. So they built their own.<a href=\"#footnote2-33-3667\" id=\"note2-33-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">33</a><p>Innovations like these helped make the Tesla a standout car, but there were still questions around the major shortcomings of EV cars. Of the three EV concerns we listed earlier, AC Propulsion had made significant headway on two—performance and battery range—and the Tesla team had picked it up from there and had continued to improve both. Performance was now the best in the world for a sedan and the battery range—between 208 and 270 miles per charge, depending on the model—was excellent.</p><p>But there were still two problematic questions that needed to be addressed:</p><p>Can you take a road trip? And can anyone afford the car? Tesla is working on both.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How Tesla is solving the road trip problem:</strong></span></p><p>With a 200+ range, the Tesla battery has plenty of juice to get most people through the day on any normal day. Even a busy day of commuting and errands and exploration rarely gets close to 200 miles driving. But on long city-to-city drives or road trips, EVs have always had an issue. So Musk came up with a solution:</p><p>Build a worldwide energy network. Tesla came up with the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/tesla-motors-supercharger-event\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharger</a>—a high-caliber, on-the-road charger—and there would be public stations that would contain a whole row of Superchargers, just like a row of gas pumps at a gas station. A normal garage charger takes either 5 or 10 hours to fully charge the Model S battery, depending on which type of in-car charging system you opted for. Clearly no one wants to stop for multiple hours while on the road to accomplish what a gas car can by stopping for five minutes—so the Supercharger goes much faster. It can charge a Model S at a rate that gives it about 60 miles of range for every 10 minutes of charging time. So if you’re driving between Boston and New York (215 miles), you might make it with no stopping, but if you did need to stop, you could just charge up for 5 or 10 minutes—not that much more than a stop for gas. Driving from LA to San Francisco (382 miles), you’d need to stop for 20 or 30 minutes.</p><p>And the thing is—on a 4-hour drive from Boston to New York, isn’t a 5-10 minute stop desirable anyway? On a 6-7 hour drive from LA to SF, wouldn’t most people stop for 20-30 minutes to get some food and go to the bathroom anyway?</p><p>The more I thought about this, the more I realized how little of an issue range is for an EV with a good battery like the Tesla. Just say you do a long drive five days a year. That means on 360 of the 365 days, you have to do nothing. You just drive, and <em>you never need to stop at a gas station.</em> And the other five days? You’d probably just need to stop for about as long as you would stop on a long drive anyway.</p><p>Seems like a perfect solution, but you need to have a Supercharger along <em>your </em>drive if it’s going to work. Here’s where Superchargers are today in the US:<a href=\"#footnote2-34-3667\" id=\"note2-34-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">34</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3742\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg\" alt=\"Supercharger US 14\" width=\"600\" height=\"286\" /></a></p><p>And they’re building them at a furious pace—here’s where they’ll be by the end of 2016:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3820\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"Supercharger-US-16-compressor\" width=\"600\" height=\"284\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Europe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Europe</a> and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Asia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Asia</a> will be equally well-covered.</p><p>For now, only Teslas can use the Supercharger stations, and only the Tesla can really make long-distance drives right now anyway. But down the road, Musk plans to partner with other EV car companies so any EV can stop at one.</p><p>A couple other things about Superchargers: they’re all free to use, and soon, they’ll all be entirely solar-powered. Musk jokes that if there’s a zombie apocalypse, Tesla owners will be fine because they won’t need the grid to fuel their car. And it means that if you had friends to stay with, you could technically drive across the US without taking a wallet.</p><p>This is also going to become even easier with time, because Tesla is making new innovations every year. For example, the Roadster now has a 350 mile range battery and you can just about do LA to SF without stopping—it’s only a matter of time before their cheaper cars have a similar range. Tesla also recently <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/battery-swap-event\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled</a> a new Supercharger feature—<strong>the battery swap</strong>. A Tesla driver will be able to pull up to a little rectangle and stop the car. The ground opens up and a machine comes out and takes the car’s battery off, brings up a fresh battery and puts it on, and you’re good to go—<em>all in 90 seconds</em>. This would cost $60-80, or as much as an expensive tank of gas—so Tesla drivers would now have the option of “fast or free.”</p><p>So with that problem very close to being out of the way, Tesla seems to only have one issue left:</p><p><em>Who the hell can afford a $75,000 car? </em></p><p>The starting price of a Tesla Model S is technically $69,900. But if you want the higher-range cars and the faster charging battery, the price jumps up. There are a bunch of other “well shit now that you mention it yeah I do want that too” features, and a Model S can quickly work its way toward the $100,000 mark.</p><p>Musk is always quick to point out that for the moment, the US offers a $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV of sufficient range. He also points out what I mentioned above about the $2,000-ish a year gas savings. Sure—but even subtracting all that, we’re around $55,000 for a Tesla Model S, which is prohibitive for most people. Tesla has a new car coming out soon—their SUV with <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx\" target=\"_blank\">Falcon Wing doors</a>, called the Model X—but it’s another Step 2, mid-price / mid-volume expensive car. Doesn’t solve the pricing problem.</p><p>It’s a <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089555_electric-car-market-share-in-2013-understanding-the-numbers-better\" target=\"_blank\">rule of thumb</a> in the car world that every $5,000 decrease in car price approximately doubles the number of buyers who can afford the car. So if Tesla can somehow come out with a stellar EV for about $35,000 less than the Model S, it would double the buyer pool 7 times, or multiply it by 125-fold. Which would now mean <em>most</em> people could afford it. Let’s bring back Tesla’s Hershey’s Kiss business plan from earlier:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3792\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png\" alt=\"pyramid2\" width=\"550\" height=\"414\" /></a></p><p>So Step 3 is what this is all about. Step 3 is why Tesla exists and if Tesla ends up changing the world, it’ll be because of Step 3.</p><p>That car is the Model 3, and it’s coming out in 2017. Supposedly. And it’ll cost $35,000—$27,500 after the tax credit, and after taking gas savings into account, under $20,000. Supposedly.</p><p>But <em>how? </em>Right now, the Model 3 battery costs around $20,000. Even if Tesla ditches the high-tech aluminum body, makes the car smaller, and ditches some of the fanciest things about the Model S, the battery pack alone makes a price like $35,000 impossible.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How Tesla is solving the high-price problem:</strong></span></p><p>Big problems call for big solutions. To solve the range problem, Tesla is building a worldwide energy network of Superchargers. And to solve the price problem, they’re building this:<a href=\"#footnote2-35-3667\" id=\"note2-35-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">35</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3821\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"hero-compressor\" width=\"800\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>That’s what Musk has named the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/gigafactory\" target=\"_blank\">Gigafactory</a>. It’s a $5 billion lithium-ion battery factory, currently being built in Nevada. The factory will be self-sufficient, powered entirely by on-site solar, wind, and geothermal energy, and it will employ 6,500 people.</p><p>Right now, the world’s combined annual output of lithium-ion batteries is 30GWh—mostly for use in laptops and mobile phones. The Gigafactory will make more than that each year, which means it will <em>more than double the total lithium-ion batteries made each year globally</em>. There are two huge benefits to doing this:</p><p>First, Tesla is planning to ramp up production of their cars until they’re producing 500,000 of them a year, and they’re going to need a lot of lithium-ion batteries when they do. Musk’s reasoning is simple: “I know we can’t get enough lithium-ion batteries unless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is building this thing.” The numbers make this necessity clear. To  make enough batteries for their planned 500,000 cars a year, Tesla will need about 30GWh of lithium-ion batteries a year—the current world output—meaning that without building the Gigafactory, they’d have to use every single lithium-ion battery in the world. Tesla’s Gigafactory will just barely cover Tesla’s needs—if a day comes when every car company is making a ton of EVs, there will need to be many Gigafactories built by many companies.</p><p>Second, by both doubling the world supply of lithium-ion batteries and by continuing to innovate with battery technology, Tesla’s work at the Gigafactory will make batteries a lot cheaper. Musk says the price of the battery should go down by <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/05/14/the-logic-of-teslas-gigafactory-the-economics-are-a-no-brainer/\" target=\"_blank\">at least 30%</a>. Right now, Musk says Tesla could make their cars with a <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/26/elon-musk-says-500-mile-ev-happen-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">500 mile range</a>—they don’t do it because it would increase the cost of the car. But as battery prices go down, EV ranges will go up as well.</p><p>I’m pretty convinced that the Model S is the best expensive car ever made. In its first year, its sales blew away its well-known direct competitors—the S-Class Mercedes, BMW 7-Series, the Lexus LS, and the Audi A8—and it’s been in the lead ever since. But those cars all play in a small space for the very rich.</p><p>It’s the Model 3 that will turn the industry on its head. You may not know much about Tesla today—or particularly care—but I’m pretty sure everyone will know about the Model 3 soon. Maybe that’s why Musk refuses to do any advertising—because he knows that when the Model 3 comes out, he won’t have to.</p><p>The market has taken notice. Tesla’s $226 million IPO in June of 2010 marks the first IPO for an American car company since Ford went public in 1956. Since then, the company’s value has soared upwards. Today, seven years after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:TSLA\" target=\"_blank\">market cap</a> is a massive $31 billion. To put in perspective how big a deal that is, I set Tesla’s path to that number down on a graph with the Big Three US automakers (just using straight lines to simplify):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3829\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg\" alt=\"Car Graphs\" width=\"638\" height=\"399\" /></a></p><p>The car industry forest canopy has been pretty stagnant for a long time, and for decades, no hungry underdog has been able to make a run at it. Tesla hasn’t cracked the canopy yet, but for the first time in a long time, there’s a new company bolting upwards from the ground at lightning speed.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>A Ripple Effect</strong></span></p><p>If you’re another one of the big car companies, and you’ve been around for decades, and you’re comfortably doing your thing, making slight incremental improvements each year to your existing line of cars—could <em>anything in the world</em> be more annoying than Tesla?</p><p>Remember, the car companies know alllll about electric cars and their benefits. Most of them made an electric car in the 1990s when California mandated that they do, and then the second the mandate went away, they confiscated and literally <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F\" target=\"_blank\">crushed</a> the cars. Then they whipped the cars into the dump and covered the pile with a tablecloth with a “nothing to see here folks” look on their faces. The scare was over and they could go back to their comfort zone, incrementally improving their gas vehicles.</p><p>Their feelings on EVs make perfect sense:</p><p>Dealerships make a huge amount of profit fixing gas engines, oil filters, and doing oil changes—money they’d stop making when they sold EVs with motors that rarely broke.</p><p>The car companies already know gas cars back and forth, and they’ve mastered the art of making a few tiny new changes to them each year so the new year’s models will be a little better than the previous year’s. But EVs are a new world for them, and they don’t know any more about how to make a good powertrain or improve battery energy density than Tesla does—in fact, they know less, as evidenced by Toyota and Mercedes both buying the Tesla powertrain for their EVs. What a pain in the ass all that R&amp;D would be.</p><p>Most importantly, the world already wants to buy gas cars. There’s no convincing needed—just a few standard TV ads to hone the latest phase of the brand’s image and inform customers about the latest product updates. But EVs are new and scary to customers, and there’s a hump to get over in educating the world about why they should buy one. But the <em>really </em>problematic thing about this is that in order to market an EV well, you need to do what I’m doing in this post and explain all the reasons EVs are obviously a huge step forward from gas cars—which simultaneously sends the message, “Gas cars are dirty, inconvenient, and old-fashioned.” Not a thing you want to do when your current bread and butter is selling 10 million gas cars a year.</p><p>And who wants to deal with all of these things when they could just skip it <i>if Tesla would just go away.</i></p><p>Franz von Holzhausen has worked at three of these other companies. The way he sees it, “they’re trapped in their manufacturing legacy process, trapped in gas engines being their bread and butter, trapped in their dealership model, trapped in their own history.”</p><p>Musk explains it as a lack of guts and originality: “The big car companies are so derivative. They want to see it work somewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward.”<a href=\"#footnote2-36-3667\" id=\"note2-36-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">36</a><p>But the Tesla tree is racing upwards, and its impending burst through the canopy has successfully scared the industry. We know this for sure, because when the first Tesla Roadster shipped in 2008, there were <em>no </em>big company EVs on the market. Today, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Mitsubishi, and Smart <em>all </em><a href=\"http://www.plugincars.com/cars\" target=\"_blank\">have an EV</a> on the road. Not a coincidence.</p><p>So what’s the deal with all of these other EVs?</p><p>Most notable is the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/nissan-leaf\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan Leaf</a>, introduced in 2010, which has been the highest-selling EV in the world in recent years (though the much more expensive Tesla Model S has topped the industry in EVs sold <a href=\"http://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/\" target=\"_blank\">so far in 2015</a>). The Leaf costs about $30,000 ($22,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 84 miles. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has for a while been one of the few strongly pro-EV voices in the car industry outside of Tesla. He <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1095851_electric-cars-win-for-4-reasons-says-nissans-carlos-ghosn\" target=\"_blank\">talks about</a> the “cul-de-sac” effect that will begin to accelerate EV sales—i.e. people will be jealous that their neighbor has a more futuristic car and doesn’t have to get gas, will ask questions, and then might get one themselves.</p><p>The recently introduced <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/bmw-i3.html\" target=\"_blank\">BMW i3</a> is currently selling next best after the Leaf and Model S. It costs $43,000 ($35,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 81 miles. BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer has jumped on the EV train, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578635543525172364\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a>, “You have to look into the future, 10, 15, 20 years…cars like the BMW i3 are a must.”</p><p>No other EV has had significant sales yet.<a href=\"#footnote-23-3667\" id=\"note-23-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a> I asked Musk about the Leaf and the i3. About the Leaf, he said, “The range is too low, but if they keep iterating on that, they’ll eventually get there.” On the i3: “They’re trying to do something there. The range is low, but it’s a step in the right direction, and if they keep going, they’ll get something there.”</p><p>This “Congrats on your first big boy toilet poop, Johnny, now next time try to get the whole thing inside the bowl and you’ll be on your way!” tone is about as effusive as Musk gets when assessing the industry’s current attempts at an EV.</p><p>Volkswagen just hired BMW’s ex-CEO and also <a href=\"http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/\" target=\"_blank\">seems to be</a> bullish on EVs, and GM is promising big things with their upcoming EV, the Chevy Bolt.</p><p>Other car companies still aren’t convinced. Mercedes CEO Dieter Zetsche <a href=\"http://ecomento.com/2015/04/02/mercedes-ceo-dieter-zetsche-looks-at-the-electric-car-future/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he doesn’t expect EVs to sell well for a while, because “the customer gets a car with less range, longer refueling times, somewhat less space, and a higher price tag.” The major Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, are both skeptical about EVs and have been pouring their future into hybrids and hydrogen cars instead. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne is so anti-EV that he’s told the world <em>not </em>to buy their Fiat 500e EV, saying they’re only selling it because regulations have forced them to.</p><p>If EVs are the dominant car of the future, they have a long way to go to get there. As of January 2015, there were a total of <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/28/ev-demand-growing-global-market-hits-740000-units/\" target=\"_blank\">740,000</a> EVs on the road worldwide. Compare that to the whole picture of over 80 million cars sold worldwide annually and over a billion total cars on the road. EVs make up only a fraction of a percent of the car industry. But they’re on the move:<a href=\"#footnote2-37-3667\" id=\"note2-37-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">37</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3710 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png\" alt=\"ev-fleet-count\" width=\"532\" height=\"352\" /></a></p><p>So we’re either at the cusp of a new EV-dominated car era or in the middle of another little EV bubble before they vanish from existence <em>again</em>—and as you can see from the quotes above, the car industry is currently divided in which way they’re betting.</p><p>I think we’ll learn a lot more soon, because the world is still yet to see its first true potential EV disruptor. The issue with Tesla right now is most people can’t afford one, and the issue with <em>every </em>other EV is the range sucks. It looks like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3775\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png\" alt=\"Plot\" width=\"500\" height=\"471\" /></a></p><p>The truth is, the typical American drives <a href=\"http://www.facethefactsusa.org/facts/the-asphalts-getting-crowded-video-\" target=\"_blank\">37 miles a day</a> on average, and the 80+ mile range options are probably actually plenty for most people. But 80 miles seems like an insufficient range to prospective buyers, and mass adoption won’t happen with that kind of range.</p><p>Tesla’s plan all along was to plant a stellar car right in that Quadrant 4 box, and that’s what they say they’re going to do in 2017 when the Model 3 comes out. A number of other carmakers, including <a href=\"http://www.leftlanenews.com/nissan-leaf-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan</a>, <a href=\"http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/\" target=\"_blank\">Volkswagen</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/01/14/what-mary-barras-growth-strategy-says-about-the-new-gm/\" target=\"_blank\">GM</a> have all declared their intention to release a not-that-expensive long-range EV soon. It’s not clear if any or all of these companies will get into Quadrant 4, but if they do…</p><p>If there are high-quality, affordable EVs for sale that also have a high range…</p><p><strong>I cannot think of <em>one </em>reason <em>anyone </em>would <em>ever </em>buy a gas car again.</strong></p><p>A Tesla-quality car that’s affordable to the middle class would seem to have only pros in the Pro/Con list:</p><p><strong>Pros of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Drives better. </strong>The instant torque of an EV is like exploding out of a gun. There’s no lag time between your foot touching the pedal and the car moving. Without gears, it accelerates perfectly smoothly. The handling is incredible. It’s silent.</li><li><strong>More convenient. </strong>No stops for gas. Much less need to take the car in for maintenance. No oil changes. More storage because with no engine, the hood is now the frunk (the front trunk).</li><li><strong>Safer. </strong>With no engine, the entire front of the car becomes a crumple zone. That’s part of why the Model S has blown away the safety ratings.</li><li><strong>Cheaper. </strong>No gas or oil, and less maintenance. No longer beholden to fluctuating gas prices.</li><li><strong>Healthier. </strong>No smog in cities, which cause <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/dangers-smog-what-you-need-know-about-air-pollution#2\" target=\"_blank\">many, many health problems.</a></li><li><strong>Oh yeah, and the whole thing about avoiding an environmental, economic, or geopolitical catastrophe.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p><ul><li>People who love to shift the manual stick around with all their muscle because they’re a cool cat on the open road to destiny can’t do that.</li><li>Five days a year, when you’re on a long drive, you have to stop for 30 minutes every three hours instead of five minutes every four hours—a con that becomes moot if you would have stopped for 30 minutes anyway every few hours.</li></ul><p>EVs aren’t there yet. Right now, there are legit cons. But as the next few years pass, EVs will get cheaper, battery ranges will get longer and longer, Superchargers will pop up more and more until they’re everywhere, and charging times will just decrease as technology advances. Maybe I’m missing something, and I’m sure a bunch of seething commenters will try to make that very clear to me, but it seems like a given to me: the gas era is over and EVs are the obvious, <em>obvious </em>future.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>An Angry Giant</strong></span></p><p>The car companies, as I mentioned, aren’t happy about all of this—they’re acting like a kid with a cupcake whose parents are forcing them to eat their vegetables.</p><p>But how about the oil industry?</p><p>Unlike car companies, the oil industry can’t suck it up, get on the EV train, and after an unpleasant hump, continue to thrive. If EVs catch on in a serious way and end up being the ubiquitous type of car, oil companies are ruined. 45% of all the world’s extracted oil is used for transportation, but in the developed world, it’s much higher—in the US, 71% of extracted oil is used for transportation, and most of that is for cars.</p><p>So if the car industry has a cupcake and its parents are forcing it to eat vegetables, the oil industry has a cupcake but <i>its </i>parents are forcing it to eat <em>razor blades.</em> The car industry will resist the veggies and have a little tantrum before grudgingly giving in—the oil industry will <em>furiously try to gouge the parents’ eyes out in resistance </em>because for him, this is life and death.</p><p>And that’s how the oil industry sees EVs—horrifying razor blades. And giant industries don’t just roll over and eat razor blades without a serious fight.</p><p>We’ve seen this before. Tobacco companies fought tooth and nail to stay alive and strong as long as possible when the tide started to turn against them. And the oil industry itself has been fighting tooth and nail for a while now on another front—the battle to keep people confused about whether global warming is a thing.</p><p>Usually in these cases, the industry clawing for survival knows it’s on the way out. But in the meantime, they’re making money, and the longer it takes before the public fully gets the situation, the longer it’ll be before the public uniformly rejects them, politicians are able to regulate against them, and the money finally stops. Time is very much money in these situations.</p><p>The tactic to stay alive longer is always the same—put out misinformation to create confusion, and make it political so half the country feels like they’re going against “their own team” if they side against the industry.</p><p>The super-clever way they create confusion is by generating the public perception that there’s a genuine debate among scientists. That’s how you make a 97% consensus seem like an open question:<a href=\"#footnote2-38-3667\" id=\"note2-38-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">38</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3708\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg\" alt=\"consensus_gap\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\" /></a></p><p>The same tactic was used a few decades ago when 98% of scientists said smoking caused lung cancer, but the tobacco industry convinced the public for a long time that “scientists disagree” about whether smoking is harmful. The book <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> details how many of the same pro-smoking “scientists” a generation later became the “global warming isn’t a thing” scientists—the actual same <em>people.</em></p><p>When the 1990 California Zero Emissions Mandate forced car companies to make an EV in order to continue selling cars in CA, the oil industry saw it as a small tumor they needed to swiftly nip in the bud before it grew into a serious threat. Soon, a new voice popped up, a grassroots campaign called “Californians Against Utility Company Abuse” (CAUCA). The campaign staged protests against the state’s proposed utility investments in alternative-vehicle support systems. They also mentioned that “the environmental benefits of electric cars were dubious.”<a href=\"#footnote2-39-3667\" id=\"note2-39-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">39</a> But as it turns out, CAUCA was created by a PR firm who was hired and funded by the oil industry. Eventually, the mandate was repealed, EVs disappeared, and the tumor was squashed.</p><p>Now, there’s a new tumor for the oil industry—Elon Musk. Tesla is showing the public directly that EVs are the future and funding the development of technology that’s making EVs better than anyone thought possible. A government mandate is crushable—obsessed Model S owners are not.</p><p>But again, oil doesn’t need to avoid an EV future to have a reason to fight—it just needs to <em>delay </em>the EV future for <em>as long as it possibly can. </em>Tesla’s mission is “to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.” Big oil’s current mission is “to <em>delay </em>the advent of sustainable transport by making people think EVs aren’t actually better for the environment than gas cars.”</p><p>EVs are most definitely better for the environment—so the oil industry reaches for a key tool.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3832\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png\" alt=\"BS 2\" width=\"450\" height=\"322\" /></a></p><p>There are now a bunch of myths floating around. I didn’t treat them like automatic myths—each time I heard an argument for why EVs are dirty, I dug in and read about it, but each time, there was little basis in fact. Some examples of myths I’ve seen floating around about EVs or Tesla in particular:</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>EV battery disposal is <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/01/09/electric-car-subsidies-transferring-wealth-from-poor-to-rich/\" target=\"_blank\">hazardous</a>.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>A) Lithium-ion cells used in cars aren’t especially hazardous and are classified as landfill safe, B) They’re almost all recycled anyway, and C) They’ll continue to be recycled, because a used car battery still has a lot of value, either as a stationary battery or in the raw materials themselves.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>Manufacturing a Tesla is much dirtier than manufacturing a Prius or many other gas cars.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>Expensive cars are dirtier to manufacture than cheap ones. Comparing the manufacturing of a Tesla to a Prius is like saying “Prius’s are dirty because it’s dirtier to manufacture a Prius than a golf cart.” If you compare apples to apples, it’s no dirtier to make a Tesla than a similarly-priced luxury car.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>EVs are a huge burden on the electric grid.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>The grid is sized for the worst second of the worst day of the worst year—so there’s usually a lot of excess capacity. You could replace 70% of US gas car miles with EV miles with no changes to the grid. That percentage will also grow even higher as more homes get their power from solar panels.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>The Tesla uses a lot of graphite in their battery, which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-14/teslas-in-california-help-bring-dirty-rain-to-china\" target=\"_blank\">contributes</a> to China’s pollution problem.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>The logic here is: “Tesla batteries use graphite; the world’s biggest source of graphite is in China; China has terrible pollution; therefore, Tesla is partially responsible for China’s pollution.” Except when I did some digging, I learned that Tesla uses synthetic graphite made mostly in Japan and Poland, and that the average Model S uses 100kg of it. That 100kg lasts for ten years, so the amount of graphite used to make a Model S is similar to the amount you’d use if you had a few barbecues a year.</p><p>But there’s one myth which has been more effective and more pervasive than any of these—<strong>the long tailpipe theory.</strong></p><p>The long tailpipe theory is everywhere. Anyone who doesn’t like EVs points it out immediately. So what’s the theory? I’ll let Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld do the honors:</p><p>“The entire reason for doing these stupid little cars is a lie because electricity comes from coal. In some cases, some studies show that these can produce more pollution than internal combustion engines.”<a href=\"#footnote2-40-3667\" id=\"note2-40-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">40</a><p>Upon first examination, this makes sense. Let’s bring back our US emissions chart to see what Greg means:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3768\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png\" alt=\"US Emissions 2013 2\" width=\"900\" height=\"515\" /></a></p><p>Earlier in the post, we identified the two biggest causes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: cars running on gas and coal making electricity. The long tailpipe theory’s logic is that all an EV does is shift energy production from the first bad category to the second bad category. Since coal is the most prominent source of electricity in the world, and coal emits about 1.5 times more carbon than oil per joule of energy produced, EVs are actually worse emissions culprits than gas cars.</p><p>When you read about EVs or talk to people about them, you’ll hear this theory come up <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/17/unplug-the-volt/\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-10/opinion/ct-oped-0810-goldberg-20100810_1_electric-cars-chevy-volt-ev1\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102273164\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/049504_electric_cars_ethanol_greenwashing.html#\" target=\"_blank\">again</a>.</p><p>The thing you’ll notice, though, is that every time you hear someone all mad about the long tailpipe emissions of EVs, they’re using wording like, “may be” and “often” and, in the case of Greg, “in some cases, some studies show.” That’s because you have to use words like that when you’re saying things that you wish were true but actually aren’t.</p><p>Taking the US as an example, here’s why they’re wrong:</p><p><strong>1) US electricity production is mixed, not just coal. </strong>Coal only makes up 39% of US electricity production. And that number’s going down:<a href=\"#footnote2-41-3667\" id=\"note2-41-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">41</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3818\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.56.42 PM\" width=\"633\" height=\"302\" /></a></p><p>Natural gas, which emits less than half the CO<sub>2</sub> of coal, now makes up over a quarter of US electricity production. Nuclear and renewables emit almost no CO<sub>2</sub> and now produce a third of US electricity.</p><p><strong>2) Energy production is more efficient in a power plant than it is in a car engine. </strong>To use an example with an identical source fuel, burning natural gas in a power plant is about <a href=\"http://www.npc.org/study_topic_papers/4-dtg-electricefficiency.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">60% efficient</a>, meaning 40% of the energy of the fuel is lost in the energy production process. In a car, burning gas is less than 25% efficient, with the vast majority of the energy lost to heat. The larger more complex system at a power plant will always be far better at capturing waste heat than a tiny car engine. The increased efficiency means that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">even a car running <em>purely </em>on coal-generated electricity will emit carbon at the same rate as a gas car that gets 30 miles per gallon</span>—which would be a significantly cleaner-than-average gas car.</p><p>Because the breakdown of energy source is different in different states, an EV will be greener in some places than others. The US Department of Energy has a <a href=\"http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php\" target=\"_blank\">great tool</a> to assess exactly how an EV stacks up against a gas car in any zip code in the country.</p><p>In the parts of the country that use very little coal, like upstate New York, an EV’s well-to-wheel emissions are <em>far </em>less than that of a gas car (on the chart, HEV = a traditional hybrid car, PHEV = a plug-in hybrid car):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3724\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.05.59 PM\" width=\"601\" height=\"268\" /></a></p><p>In the heaviest coal states, like Colorado, EVs cause a lot more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions—but still less than a gas car:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3723\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.04.39 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"270\" /></a></p><p>The national average is somewhere in between, putting an EV at 61% of a gas car’s emissions overall:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3725\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.06.20 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"262\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Union of Concerned Scientists</a><a href=\"#footnote-24-3667\" id=\"note-24-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a> came up with a way to directly compare car emissions, regardless of the type of car it is—a metric called “miles per gallon equivalent,” or MPG<sub>ghg</sub> (ghg stands for greenhouse gases).</p><p>MPG<sub>ghg</sub> is how many miles per gallon a gas car would need to achieve in order to match the carbon emissions of an EV (in the EV’s case, the emissions come from the plant that makes the electricity). In other words, if an EV gets 40 MPG<sub>ghg</sub>, it means it emits the exact same amount of carbon as a gas car that gets 40 MPG.</p><p>The average new gas car gets 23 MPG. Anything above 30 MPG is really good for a gas car, and anything below 15 or 17 is bad. For reference, remember that an EV running on <em>just </em>coal-produced electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg </sub>of 30 (so even in a hypothetical entirely coal-powered state, an EV would be the same as a highly efficient gas car), and an EV running on just natural gas-powered electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg</sub> of 54 and just top the Toyota Prius, which runs at 50 MPG.</p><p>Here’s a useful map that shows the kind of MPG<sub>ghg</sub> EVs get in different parts of the US:<a href=\"#footnote2-42-3667\" id=\"note2-42-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">42</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3828\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg\" alt=\"MPG Map\" width=\"738\" height=\"822\" /></a></p><p>So even for the 17% of the population living in the worst coal states, an EV beats almost all gas cars. This sums it up:<a href=\"#footnote2-43-3667\" id=\"note2-43-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">43</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3721\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.52.33 PM\" width=\"672\" height=\"197\" /></a></p><p>And the thing is, each year, that already-nicely-positioned blue bar will make a little jump to the right. Because the grid is getting cleaner every year, it means an EV gets cleaner as time goes by. Gas cars are locked where they are, and they’ll be stuck watching as the future pulls away from them.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>I didn’t feel strongly about this topic before I spent a lot of recent time learning about it—and now that I have, I kind of think the only way someone could feel positive about a gas car future is if they’re misinformed, personally financially interested in gas cars, hopelessly old-fashioned, drunk with politics, or kind of just being a dick? Right? They would have to be one of those five things to be super pro-gas car—right?</p><p>The battle going on isn’t about gas cars vs. electric cars. That one’s already decided. This is a war about time. Oil companies will try to slow things down, and they may succeed—but they’re not winning this one. I just don’t see how they could. A company that makes lantern fuel can stay strong for a while by shielding the public from understanding what a light bulb is, but eventually, people will figure it out and lanterns will be out of business, bringing the lantern fuel company down with it. Greasy hoods are old, noisy acceleration is old, overheating engines are old, oil changes are old, and it won’t be long before everyone realizes that. A fun field trip in 2050 will be taking your grandkid to see an old 20th-century gas station and explaining how it worked.<a href=\"#footnote-25-3667\" id=\"note-25-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a> Driving a gas car is like littering on a camping trail, smoking on an airplane, and throwing a big stack of paper in the trash, and it’s just a matter of time until public disgust catches up to it.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Zooming Back Out</strong></span></p><p>Learning to harness the dragon of fire launched our modern world, and still today, we live in the age of burning. But we need to move on—we need to stop plowing through the trust fund and get a job. The dog needs to let the cave go. We need to learn to make energy the adult way—sustainably.</p><p>The sustainable energy world of the future—the yellow zone of our <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\" target=\"_blank\">timeline</a> from earlier in the post—is simple. It looks like this:</p><p><strong>1) Almost everything we use will run on electricity.</strong></p><p><strong>2) Almost all of our electricity will be produced from sustainable sources.</strong></p><p>That’s a world running on sunlight and electricity, and burning has no part in that world.</p><p>This transition will happen in steps, over time. At the beginning of the post, we identified the two problems we needed to address most urgently: 1) Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty. 2) Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</p><p>We spent the rest of the post zoomed in on Problem 2 to examine how things got that way, stayed that way, and why we may be witnessing the moment it finally changes.</p><p>We won’t get into Problem 1 today—but both Musk, through the US-leading solar panel installation company he co-founded, <a href=\"http://www.solarcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SolarCity</a>, and Tesla, with their new product, the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall\" target=\"_blank\">Powerwall</a> stationary battery,<a href=\"#footnote-26-3667\" id=\"note-26-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a> are leading the way in this half of the energy equation too. For those interested, I put up a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html\" target=\"_blank\">mini post</a> on solar power and SolarCity.</p><p>People don’t quite realize it yet, but as of this moment, a family or business has the option to individually move themselves into the sustainable future. Using products made by SolarCity and Tesla alone, you can today live in a home and drive a car that are both powered by a solar panel-connected battery and live entirely on sunlight. Musk and his companies have made a little yellow brick road right out of the Fossil Fuel Era for anyone who wants to leave. And if modern technology can allow individual people, businesses, or even whole cities to live without fossil fuels, it hints that the only era any of us has ever known might be soon coming to an end.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>How to Change the World</strong></span></p><p>A study of Tesla isn’t about a car or a car company—it’s about how change happens. And about why it often doesn’t happen.</p><p>Our intuition tells us that technology, social norms, movements and ideas just move forward through time, as if forward progress is a river and those things are on a raft gliding through. We so associate the passage of time with progress that we use the term “the future” to refer to a better, more advanced version of our present world.</p><p>In reality, if a more advanced future does happen, it’s because that future was <em>willed</em> into our lives by a few brave people. The present isn’t welcoming of an advanced future because the present is run by a thick canopy made up of the<span class=\"s1\"> ideas, norms, and technologies of the <em>past. </em>There’ll be incremental tweaks and slight iterations on proven-to-work concepts, which may <em>seem </em>to us like moving into the future, but it’s really just a polishing up of the past.</span></p><p>When the real change arrives, you know you’re seeing it. <span class=\"s1\">It’s a distinct and exhilarating feeling when you witness a disrupting innovator ram its way through the canopy. I had that feeling when I watched Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OEsI0Sc_s\" target=\"_blank\">introduce</a> the iPhone in 2007. Before that moment, I had assumed that the ubiquitous Blackberrys and Nokias and Razors of the world were cutting-edge technology—but that keynote was an epiphany about how buried in the past those phones actually were. You don’t realize your Blackberry sucks until the iPhone exists. The feeling I had watching that keynote is the same feeling I had when I was six and I saw someone type on a computer word processor for the first time, and the last word on the line would magically jump to the line below when it hit the edge. Typewriters, which had seemed normal that morning, were suddenly ancient. The same thing happened when I saw the first iPod and became instantly disgusted with my horribly clunky and inefficient big booklet of CDs.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I had this feeling again, last month, when I test drove a Tesla Model S. I had driven to the Tesla factory that morning in what had felt like a brand new rental car, and I left the factory in the same car, now feeling like a 1982 model. I get now why Matthew Inman <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s\" target=\"_blank\">calls</a> his Model S a “magical space car”—because that’s how it felt. That’s how a new, revolutionary technology always feels. Our modern world became as advanced as it is not by floating up an inevitable advancement river, but because of a collection of moments over time when a person or company has done something that makes everyone’s jaw drop.</span></p><p>But those world-changing moments don’t just smoothly glide into the world: these leaps into the future usually have to <span class=\"s1\"><em>jam </em>themselves through the canopy and then battle to keep themselves there. The past, which likes to loiter casually in our present world, hates when a piece of the future bursts onto the scene, because that exposes the past for being what it really is—the past. So a new and disruptive technology is often met with hostility as it emerges, as the existing canopy does whatever it can to squash the potential disruptor out of existence before it can gain momentum and start to spread. The old guard knows that once a disruptor gets a foothold and starts quickly spreading its ideas, the entire game changes—and once that balance tips, now instead of trying to squash the disruptor, everyone has to scramble </span><span class=\"s1\">to try to <em>emulate</em> it.</span></p><p>What Tesla is doing right now is an up-close example of how that kind of change happens.</p><p>The idea to change the car industry started as brainwaves zipping around Elon Musk’s head, as Christie Nicholson learned the hard way, but Musk couldn’t do much about it on his own. To make the idea real, he had to <em>scale </em>those brainwaves up, and he did that by building Tesla. That brought a new player into the car industry, run by a collective super-brain made up of 11,000 Tesla employees who also happened to think a lot about electric cars.</p><p>Change doesn’t happen on a familiar landscape—change has to construct the landscape itself. This is part of the reason the challenges Tesla has taken on are so enormous. Henry Ford didn’t just build a car—he built a landscape, defining what a car was. Since then, car companies have worked within Ford’s landscape. Bringing back what Musk said about Ford—<em>He was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn’t know what they needed</em>—it’s clear that this is exactly what Musk and Tesla are doing right now. If there aren’t enough charging stations for long-trips, build an energy network of Superchargers. If scalability is held back by the high price of lithium-ion batteries, build a factory that doubles the world supply of them to bring the price down. Just get it done.</p><p>But with a goal as ambitious as “accelerating the advent of sustainable transport” and a victory condition as far-reaching as “half of all new cars being electric,”<a href=\"#footnote-27-3667\" id=\"note-27-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a> building one great car company isn’t enough. To bring Musk’s original idea to the next level, Tesla would need to scale <em>itself</em>. To do that, Tesla is building a line of cars so stellar that it’s going to change the public’s expectations of a what a car should be, and the whole industry will have to adjust to that new expectation.</p><p>And by solving so many EV problems for its own cars, it’s forging the path to an EV-dominated world for all the other companies too. A company trying to rise to the top of their industry would hold their innovation secrets close—but because Tesla’s goal is to<em> transform</em> the industry, in 2014, Tesla made <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you\" target=\"_blank\">all of their patents</a> available to whomever wanted them.</p><p class=\"p1\">Other companies are critical to the mission, because Tesla’s goal is to ramp production up to 500,000 cars, which is only around half a percent of the total cars made each year. He explained, “The impact that Tesla will have is fairly small in and of itself. It will change people’s perception perhaps, but it will not in and of itself change the world. But if large numbers of people are choosing to buy the Model 3, and the car companies see that there’s no excuse left anymore because the car’s long range and the car’s handling and acceleration is better in every way than a gasoline car, and it’s affordable—and people are pretty sure this is what they want to buy—then that’s what will prompt car companies to invest real money into electric vehicle programs of their own, and indirectly, by spurring competition, Tesla can be the catalyst for a multi-order of magnitude shift of the entire industry towards electric.”</p><p>That’s how to spread the brainwaves of a single person throughout a huge industry and the global public—and by the time it’s done, everyone will think a lot about electric cars.</p><p>Maybe I’m wrong about something, or maybe something unexpected happens—but from what I’ve seen, read, and talked about, it really seems like Tesla is going to fulfill its mission and change the world. It’s going to <em>accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. </em>If the Model 3 ends up being as great as they say it’s gonna be, there’s no doubt in my mind that electric cars will be the norm far earlier than they would have been. Which will, in turn, mean that 50 years from now, the atmosphere’s CO<sub>2</sub> level will probably be lower than it would have otherwise been, cities will be less smoggy than they would have otherwise been, global temperatures will be lower than they would have otherwise been, the sad polar bear will get to eat seals again, along with about 12 other positive effects that will legitimately affect our lives. Pretty down-the-middle definition of changing the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is what Musk spends <em>two</em> days of his week on. With the rest of his time, he’s trying to make humanity a multi-planetary species—a goal that makes his Tesla mission seem like starting a grapefruit stand.

So to say it boringly, the gravitational potential energy of the sun’s particles ignites fusion, which generates radiation energy, and that’s the energy we receive from the sun on Earth.

General Motors actually had made a great electric car in the 90s that customers loved, called the EV1. But GM realized that if the car caught on too much, the California mandate would look like a huge success and other states might decide to do it too. Meanwhile, customers might also decide they all wanted electric cars. None of this would be ideal, considering that GM makes 10 million new cars a year, 99.9% of them run on gas, and it would suck if GM’s entire inventory was suddenly seen as outdated. So GM and the other companies did their best <em>not </em>to sell their electric cars, to show how little the world wanted them and how big a failure the California mandate was. After using all the muscle they had to shut down the mandate (with the help of the Bush administration, whose Chief of Staff, Andy Card, was CEO of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association previously), car companies whisked the new electric vehicles they had made off the roads. GM, who had only <em>leased</em> the EV1 to customers, demanded each one returned, against the pleading wishes of their lessees, and then had all of them crushed like the mafia offing a bad apple they wanted to make disappear. EV1 lovers staged a <em>funeral</em> for the cars. Not many instances in history when a company has torn a product away from paying customers who cared so much about it they’d read eulogies about it. The well-made documentary <a href=\"http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Who Killed the Electric Car?</em></a>, made in 2006,<em> </em>tells the whole story (the sequel, <a href=\"http://www.revengeoftheelectriccar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Revenge of the Electric Car</em></a>, made in 2011, tells the story of Tesla and the recent resurgence of the electric vehicle market).<a href=\"#note-12-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-13-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk reportedly did not get laid that night.<a href=\"#note-13-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-14-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Alternating current is the type of current that comes out of your home outlets and it generates power by electrons moving back and forth in a quick vibration in the wire. This is opposed to DC, or direct current, which is the more intuitive type, used with batteries, where electrons flow through a wire in a single direction (since electric cars use batteries, the battery produces direct current, which then has to be converted into alternating current through a box in the car called an inverter). Back in the 1880s, Thomas Edison, who was heavily invested in DC, engaged in a battle with George Westinghouse, who had teamed up with Nikola Tesla to push AC, over the best way to power homes. This was called The War of Currents. Tesla’s AC won because it could travel over much larger distances without overheating—Edison’s way would have needed lots of small power stations so that each home was relatively close to one of them, while AC could be produced in a huge power plant and then travel far away through a grid.<a href=\"#note-14-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-15-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Faraday, who discovered induction, was their second choice.<a href=\"#note-15-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-16-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I cued up <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MmQb94EF1UY?t=29m14s\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> to where you can hear Musk call hydrogen cars “bullshit” and then go on a little rant about them.<a href=\"#note-16-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-17-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Among many reasons hydrogen cars seem inferior to EVs, here are four:</p><p>1) Hydrogen cars seem beholden to natural gas, a fossil fuel, in order to extract the hydrogen fuel, while electric cars get cleaner over time as electricity production gets cleaner.</p><p>2) When it comes to energy density, driving range, and cost, the best case scenario for hydrogen cells is similar to where EV batteries are now, and EV batteries will get better with time.</p><p>3) Hydrogen is a somewhat dangerous and difficult-to-handle substance that’s a nightmare compared to the simple wall-outlet electricity EVs use.</p><p>4) Down the road, when the norm is to charge the car up in your garage, it’s going to seem primitive to have to go to a station to fuel up.</p><p>In an email exchange I had with Musk about hydrogen cars, he explained it like this:</p><p><em>If you take electricity coming from a solar panel and charge a battery, you can get ~90% efficiency. Simple and cheap. Instead, if you use that electricity to split water, separate the hydrogen with extreme purity, pressurize it to crazy levels (or, even worse, liquefy), transfer it to a giant (even in liquid form) hydrogen storage tank in the car and then recombine it with oxygen to generate electricity, you would be lucky to get ~20% efficiency. Expensive, complex, bulky and super inefficient. It loses on every dimension, including refuel time when pack swap is factored in. </em></p><p><em>Cost is bad for fuel cells, but that is only one of many bad dimensions. If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million. They are not.</em></p><p>Finally, if I wasn’t already convinced, this highly-detailed, fairly devastating <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/04/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-about-not-clean/\" target=\"_blank\">takedown</a> of the argument hydrogen cars left me feeling eternally puzzled about why the Japanese companies would want to go further down that road.<a href=\"#note-17-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-18-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>When you click a footnote next to “kWh,” you’re signing up to learn what a kWh is. Here we go:</p><p>A watt isn’t a unit of energy, it’s a <em>rate </em>of energy usage—which is a unit of <em>power</em>. The unit of <em>energy </em>is the joule (which itself is the energy required to move one newton one meter). 1 watt = 1 joule/second. 1 kilowatt is 1,000 joules/second. A megawatt is 1 million joules/second, and a gigawatt is 1 billion joules/second. They’re units of power.</p><p>But a watt-<em>hour, </em>like a joule, is a unit of <em>energy. </em>It’s the amount of energy needed to run something at a rate of one watt for one hour. When we talk about car batteries, we don’t use joules because the numbers would be too big and inconvenient. Instead, we use kWh. 1 kWh = 1,000 joules/second over an entire hour = 3,600,000 joules.<a href=\"#note-18-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-19-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>At the time, they didn’t own the rights to the name yet—some guy in Sacramento did.<a href=\"#note-19-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-20-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>They were both so sad about this that they still aren’t on speaking terms today.<a href=\"#note-20-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-21-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk’s thoughts on the role of CEO: “The CEO receives the distillation of all the worst problems in the company, only spending time on the things that are going wrong, and you get all the stuff other people can’t take care of, so you have a filter for the crappiest problems in the company.”<a href=\"#note-21-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-22-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I’m sick of writing von Holzhausen with the little v and the upsetting spelling and I wish he had a different name.<a href=\"#note-22-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-23-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>In the almost-an-EV world of plug-in hybrids, the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/chevrolet-volt\" target=\"_blank\">Chevy Volt</a> ($35,000, 38 mile range before gas kicks in) and the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/toyota-prius-plugin-hybrid\" target=\"_blank\">Toyota Prius Plug-In</a> ($31,000, 11 mi range before gas) are the clear leaders.<a href=\"#note-23-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-24-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>No one in the world sounds less fun to hang out with than a group of concerned scientists.<a href=\"#note-24-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-25-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCs8B-TlylY\" target=\"_blank\">This Nissan commercial</a> does a good job of hammering home the message.<a href=\"#note-25-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-26-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>You can watch Musk explain everything about the Powerwall <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<a href=\"#note-26-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-27-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk has a bet going with someone that that will happen by 2027.<a href=\"#note-27-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li></ol></div><div class=\"footnotes2\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote2-1-3667\" class=\"footnote2\"><p>Gray square footnotes are as boring as you’d think a gray square footnote would be.

One type of WBW post is the &#8220;let&#8217;s just take this whole topic and really actually get to the bottom of it so we can all completely get it from here forward.&#8221; The ideal topic for that kind of post is one that&#8217;s really important to our lives, and that tends to come up a lot, but that&#8217;s also hugely complex and confusing, often controversial with differing information coming out of different mouths, and that ends up leaving a lot of people feeling like they don&#8217;t totally get it as well as they &#8220;should.&#8221;</p><p>The way I approach a post like that is I&#8217;ll start with the surface of the topic and ask myself what I don&#8217;t fully get—I look for those foggy spots in the story where when someone mentions it or it comes up in an article I&#8217;m reading, my mind kind of glazes over with a combination of &#8220;ugh it&#8217;s that icky term again nah go away&#8221; and &#8220;ew the adults are saying that adult thing again and I&#8217;m seven so I don&#8217;t actually understand what they&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; Then I&#8217;ll get reading about those foggy spots—but as I clear away fog from the surface, I often find more fog underneath. So then I research that new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down. My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.</p><p>For example, I kind of got the Iraq situation, but there was a lot of fog there too—so when I wrote <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">a post</a> about it, one fog-clearing rabbit hole took me all the way back to Muhammad in 570AD. That was the floor. Digging into another part of the story brought me to the end of World War I. Another brought me to the founding of ISIS.</p><p>Hitting the floor is a great feeling and makes me realize that the adults weren&#8217;t actually saying anything that complicated or icky after all. And when I come across that topic again, it&#8217;s <em>fun </em>now, because I <em>get </em>it and I can nod with a serious face on and be like, &#8220;Yes, interest rates are problematic&#8221; like a real person.</p><p>I&#8217;ve heard people compare knowledge of a topic to a tree. If you don&#8217;t fully get it, it&#8217;s like a tree in your head with no trunk—and without a trunk, when you learn something new about the topic—a new branch or leaf of the tree—there&#8217;s nothing for it to hang onto, so it just falls away. By clearing out fog all the way to the bottom, I build a tree trunk in my head, and from then on, all new information can hold on, which makes that topic forever more interesting and productive to learn about. And what I usually find is that so many of the topics I&#8217;ve pegged as &#8220;boring&#8221; in my head are actually just foggy to me—like watching episode 17 of a great show, which would be boring if you didn&#8217;t have the tree trunk of the back story and characters in place.</p><p>So when it was time to start what I had labeled in my head as &#8220;the Tesla post,&#8221; I knew this was going to be one of those posts. To understand if and why Tesla Motors matters, you have to understand both the story of cars and the story of energy—two worlds I somehow am simultaneously confused by and tremendously sick of. Just hearing someone say &#8220;climate change&#8221; or &#8220;energy crisis&#8221; or &#8220;tailpipe emissions&#8221; makes me kind of gag at this point—just too much politics, too many annoying people, too much misinformation on all sides, and it&#8217;s just hard to know how much I actually care and if there can be a solution to all of it anyway. So I did what I do when my tortoise shits when I&#8217;m out of the apartment and then spends hours walking through it and tracking it across everything, including the walls somehow—I rolled up my sleeves, took a deep breath, whispered, &#8220;Be a man, Tim,&#8221; and started scraping through layers of shit. If I have to live in a world with people arguing constantly about energy and oil and greenhouse gases and incentive programs, I might as well build myself a proper tree trunk.</p><p>After weeks of reading and asking questions and writing, I&#8217;ve emerged from the tortoise sewage with something that toes the line between a long blog post and a short book. I could have broken this into multiple posts, but it&#8217;s all one story and I wanted to keep it all together. It&#8217;ll be a bit of a time investment, but I think you&#8217;ll come out of it with a sturdier tree trunk about all of this than you have now. And as it turns out, when it comes to this topic, we may be witnessing a very awesome moment in history without quite realizing it yet.</p><p>Two disclaimers before we start:</p><p>1) This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political agenda. I&#8217;m not political because nothing could <em>ever possibly be more annoying </em>than American politics. I think both parties have good points, both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things, and I want nothing to do with it. So I approached this post—like I try to with every post—from a standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense.</p><p>2) Spoiler: The post is very pro-Tesla. Which might seem suspicious since A) Elon Musk asked me to write about this and B) I just wrote a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> calling him the raddest possible man. But two things to keep in mind:</p><p>First, this isn&#8217;t commissioned by Musk, and I&#8217;m being paid $0.00 for doing it. He suggested I take the issue on because I think he thinks there&#8217;s a lack of full tree trunks in people&#8217;s heads about it—but he never suggested that I say good things about Tesla, electric cars, or anything else.</p><p>Second, the currency Wait But Why lives on is integrity. Without it, WBW loses its ability to make an impact. And integrity came first here, even at the expense of Musk potentially hating me at the end of it, if that&#8217;s what was necessary. If I didn&#8217;t think this would have made a great WBW topic, I wouldn&#8217;t have taken it on, and I&#8217;m pro-Tesla in the post because after a ton of learning and thinking—including as many counterarguments to Tesla and its worldview as I could find—that&#8217;s how I feel.</p><p>And with that, let&#8217;s dive in.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 20pt;\">Contents</span></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">     <a href=\"#part1\">Part 1: The Story of Energy</a></span></strong><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><a href=\"#part2\">Part 2: The Story of Cars</a></span></strong><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">  <a href=\"#part3\">Part 3: The Story of Tesla<br /></a></span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a>Part 1: The Story of Energy</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3780 alignnone\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png\" alt=\"Story of Energy\" width=\"185\" height=\"163\" /></a></p><p>Energy is important.

The dictionary says it&#8217;s &#8220;the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform work.&#8221; And it says &#8220;work&#8221; is &#8220;the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.&#8221; Putting that together, we get energy being &#8220;the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.&#8221;</p><p>That was pretty unfun, so for our purposes, let&#8217;s call energy &#8220;the thing that lets something do stuff.&#8221;</p><p>But the tricky thing about energy is the law of conservation of energy, which says that energy can&#8217;t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another. And since every living thing needs energy in order to do stuff—and you can&#8217;t make your own energy—we&#8217;re all awkwardly left with no choice but to steal the energy we need from someone else.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3667\" id=\"note-1-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3667\" id=\"note2-1-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><sup>← <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">click these</span></sup></span></p><p>Almost all of the energy used by the Earth&#8217;s living things got to us in the first place from the sun.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3667\" id=\"note-2-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> The sun&#8217;s energy is what makes the wind blow and the rain fall and it&#8217;s what powers the Earth&#8217;s living things—the biosphere.</p><p>The joule is a common unit of energy—defined as the amount of energy it takes to apply a force of one newton through a distance of one meter<a href=\"#footnote-3-3667\" id=\"note-3-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a>. While the sun&#8217;s joules can provide any animal with heat and light, the joules that <em>power </em>all of us from the inside enter the biosphere in the first place when the sun gives them to plants.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3785\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png\" alt=\"Sun\" width=\"341\" height=\"347\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s how food is invented—plants know how to take the sun&#8217;s joules and turn them into food.</p><p>At that point, all hell breaks loose as everyone starts murdering everyone else so they can steal their joules.</p><p>We use &#8220;the food chain&#8221; as a cute euphemism for this murder/theft cycle, and we use the word &#8220;eating&#8221; to refer to &#8220;stealing someone else&#8217;s joules and also murdering them too.&#8221; A &#8220;predator&#8221; is a dick who always seems to want <em>your </em>joules over everyone else&#8217;s, and &#8220;prey&#8221; is just some sniveling nerd you particularly like to bully and steal lunch money from. Plants are the only innocent ones who actually follow the Golden Rule, but that&#8217;s just because they have the privilege of having the sun as their sugar daddy—and humans are the biosphere&#8217;s upsetting mafia boss who just takes what he wants from anyone he wants, whenever he wants. It&#8217;s not a great system, but it works.</p><p>And that all went on normally for a while, but in the last few hundred thousand years, humans started to realize something: while it was enjoyable to put new joules into your body, actually <em>using</em> those joules sucked. It&#8217;s much less fun to use a bunch of joules running fast or lifting something heavy than it is to just sit on a log pleasantly and hold onto those joules instead. So humans got clever and started to figure out ways to get joules<em> outside </em>their bodies to do work for them—by doing that, humans could have their joules and eat them too. Sometimes the methods would be dickish:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3831\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\" alt=\"Horse hand\" width=\"500\" height=\"344\" /></a></p><p>But joules aren&#8217;t only in living things. There are joules floating and swirling and zooming all around us, and by inventing the concept of <em>technology</em>, humans figured out ways to get use out of them. They made windmills that could steal some of the wind&#8217;s joules as it went by and convert them into mechanical energy to grind food. They built sailboats that would convert wind joules into kinetic boat energy they could control. Water absorbs the sun&#8217;s radiation joules and turns them into gravitational potential energy joules when it evaporates and then kinetic energy joules when it rains and slides down land, and humans saw the opportunity to snatch some of those up by creating water wheels or dams.</p><p>But the most exciting joule-stealing technology humans came up with was figuring out how to <em>burn</em> something. With wind or water, you can only capture moving joules as they go by—but when you burn something, you can take an object that has been soaking up joules for years and release them <em>all at once</em>. A joule explosion.</p><p>They called this explosion fire, and because the joules that emerged were in the useful-to-humans formats of heat energy and light energy, burning things became a popular activity.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Taming a Dragon</strong></span></p><p>We had learned to <em>harness </em>the joules of the wind and the water—to take those forces by the reins and make them ours—but when it came to the most joule-heavy force of all, fire, we couldn&#8217;t really figure out how to do anything with it other than hang out near it, cook some stuff, and generally benefit from its existence. Fire was a hectic dragon and no one had figured out how to grab its reins.</p><p>And then came the breakthrough. Steam.</p><p>Fire joules were hard to harness, but if you sent them into water, they&#8217;d get the water molecules to increasingly freak out and bounce around until finally those molecules would fully panic and start flying off the surface, evaporating upwards with the force of the raging fire below. You&#8217;d have successfully converted the thermal energy joules of the fire—which we didn&#8217;t know how to directly harness—into a powerful jet of steam we could control.</p><p>With the muscle of steam in their toolkit, the inventors of the 18th century burst into innovation. They had some serious <em>joules </em>to work with now, which opened worlds of previously-unthinkable possibility. Breakthroughs led to more breakthroughs, and at the turn of the 19th century, the progress culminated in an invention that&#8217;s often called the most impactful turning point in human history: the steam engine.</p><p>Picture your tea kettle when it gets all angry at you and starts whistling. Now imagine that instead of the steam spewing out through the nozzle, you connected the nozzle to a tube, which directs the bursting steam into an empty cylinder and then finally releases it. When the steam goes into and then out of the cylinder, it shoves a &#8220;piston&#8221; inside the cylinder on a powerful back-and-forth motion. That&#8217;s (a dramatic oversimplification of) how a steam engine works. Depending on the vehicle, the back-and-forth motion of the piston can do different things. In the example of a locomotive, the piston is attached to a rod whose back-and-forth motion turns the wheels:<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3667\" id=\"note2-2-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3681 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif\" alt=\"rodsmed\" width=\"549\" height=\"168\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using the steam engine, humanity upgraded from sailboats to steamships and from animal-drawn carts to locomotives.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3667\" id=\"note-4-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> Inside factories, people put steam to work too, swapping out their water wheels for much more effective steam-powered wheels.</p><p>With the new ability to transport many more goods and materials, much farther away, much more quickly, and to far more efficient factories, the Industrial Revolution ignited in full force. People say the Industrial Revolution was powered by steam, but steam was just the middleman—after hundreds of thousands of years of existing as passive benefactors of combustion, we had tamed the dragon, and the Industrial Revolution was powered by <em>fire.</em></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Striking Gold</strong></span></p><p>The one thing about having made fire our bitch is that we now wanted to burn a lot more things than we ever had before. For most of human history, when people wanted to burn something, they just went and found some wood. Easy. Except now it was the 19th century, and with our new appetite to burn, wood wouldn&#8217;t cut it anymore.</p><p>We knew there were other things we could burn—in Britain, they would often supplement wood by burning a black rocky substance they found on their shores. They called it coal.</p><p>The problem is that unlike wood, most of the coal in Britain wasn&#8217;t just sitting conveniently on land—it was underground. When the Industrial Revolution got going, the British started digging—they were gonna need a lot of coal. As the revolution spread through Europe and to North America, Europeans and Americans started digging too—they also were gonna need a lot of coal.</p><p>As everyone dug, they started finding other things too. They found pockets of burnable air we call natural gas and underground lakes of thick, black burnable liquid we call crude oil. It turns out that this whole time, humans had been walking around with a vast untapped treasure of tightly packed, burnable joules right underneath them. It was like a dog digging in the woods to bury a bone and uncovering an underground cave full of pulled pork.</p><p>And what does a dog do who finds a cave of pulled pork? Does he pause to think cautiously about how to proceed or consider consequences for his health? No—he eats the shit out of it. Mindlessly, at full speed.</p><p>And throughout the 19th century, coal mines and oil rigs popped up everywhere. Burning this new treasure of joules made economies soar and the incentive to innovate soared along with them—and new, fantastic technologies were born.</p><p>Like steam engine technology, the credit for the electricity revolution is owed to a collaboration of dozens of innovators spanning centuries, but it was in the 1880s that it all finally came together. In what is still probably the most significant technological shift of all time, electricity allowed the raucous power of burning to be converted into a highly tame and remarkably versatile form of energy called electrical energy. With steam as a key middleman, all those spastic combustion joules could now be sent into an organized grid of wires, transferred long distances, and delivered into residential and commercial buildings where it would wait patiently in an outlet ready to be discharged at the user&#8217;s convenience.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3667\" id=\"note-5-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> At that point, the now electrical joules could be converted into almost any kind of energy—they could boil water, freeze ice, light up the room, or make a phone call. If steam had tamed the dragon, electricity had turned the dragon into a magical butler, forever at our service. And for the first time in human history, the power was on.</p><p>Right around the time this was happening, another revolution was underway. Fire was now powering our ships, our trains, our factories, and even the new wizardry of electricity, but individual transportation was still powered by hay like it was 1775—and late 19th century humanity knew we could do better. Biological horses got super upset if you tried to power them by fire, so again, humanity got innovating, and a couple decades later, there were big, metal, horses everywhere with engine cylinders full of fire.</p><p>As coal, oil, and natural gas motivated unprecedented innovation, the resulting waves of new technologies created an unprecedented need to burn stuff—which motivated the diggers. Companies that focused on digging, sucking, and siphoning up more and more of our underground joule treasure, like John D. Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil, became the world&#8217;s biggest corporate empires. It was a new world, powered by an endless cave of pulled pork, being gorged upon by the world&#8217;s happiest dog&#8230;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Flash forward to the present day.</p><p>Burning our bounty of underground joule-packed fuel to power our world is now an innovation more than two centuries old—but in 2015, it&#8217;s still the main way humans get their power:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3667\" id=\"note2-3-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3729\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png\" alt=\"Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013\" width=\"600\" height=\"298\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s the thing about dogs—if given something delicious, they tend to eat until the food runs out or they get sick, whichever comes first, and there aren&#8217;t too many other factors in play. The modern energy debate essentially boils down to whether it&#8217;s okay that the dog is still fully enjoying himself in the cave or whether it&#8217;s not because he might be making himself dangerously sick or risk running out of pulled pork—which would be a problem, because he has grown increasingly large since finding the cave, and he has no way outside the cave of feeding his now-immense appetite.</p><p>As you might have noticed, there are a lot of people who have a lot of opinions for a lot of reasons saying a lot of things about this situation. And some are saying real things, but a large portion of them either don&#8217;t especially know what they&#8217;re talking about or they have some ulterior motive for saying what they&#8217;re saying. This makes an already complex, murky, multi-faceted topic even more confusing.</p><p>So let&#8217;s lay out what we do know and try to clarify what the hell is really going on.</p><p>To begin with—what exactly are fossil fuels and where do they come from?</p><p>Fossil fuels are called fossil fuels because they&#8217;re the remains of ancient living things. &#8220;Ancient&#8221; in this case spans a wide range. The earliest organisms that contribute to today&#8217;s fossil fuels lived during the Precambrian Eon, before there were any plants and animals on land—the fossil organisms then would have been ocean algae. People often think fossil fuels are made of dinosaurs, but any dinosaurs in our gasoline are from the last couple hundred million years—the later stretch of the timespan—and only a small contributor. The largest portion of our fossil fuels comes from plants, animals, and algae that lived during the Carboniferous Period—a 50 million year period that ended about 300 million years ago and during which there were lots of huge, shallow swamps. The swamps were important because it made it more likely that a dead organism would be preserved. You don&#8217;t become a fossil fuel if you die in a normal place and decompose away. But by dying in a swamp and sinking to the bottom, Carboniferous organisms often ended up being quickly covered by sand and clay and were able to make it underground with their joules still intact.</p><p>After hundreds of millions of years, all those organisms were squashed under intense heat and pressure and became converted into joule-dense solid, liquid, or gas—coal, oil, and natural gas. Quick blue box brush-up:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Fossil Fuels Brush-Up</strong></span></p><p><strong>Coal</strong>, a black sedimentary rock that’s found in underground layers called coal beds, is the cheapest and most plentiful of the three and is used almost entirely for making electricity. It’s also the worst culprit for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, releasing about 30% more CO<sub>2</sub> than the burning of oil and about double that of natural gas when generating an equivalent amount of heat.<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3667\" id=\"note2-4-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> The US is to coal as Saudi Arabia is to oil, possessing 22% of the world’s coal, the most of any nation. China, though, has become by far the world’s largest consumer of coal—over <em>half </em>of the coal burned in the world in recent years was burned in China.<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3667\" id=\"note2-5-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p><strong>Oil</strong>, also known as crude oil or petroleum, is a gooey black liquid normally found in deep underground reservoirs. When crude oil is extracted, it heads to the refinery, where it’s separated, using different boiling points, into a bunch of different things. Here&#8217;s how a typical barrel of US oil was broken down in 2014:<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3667\" id=\"note2-6-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><ul><li class=\"p1\">44.9% gas for cars</li><li class=\"p1\">29.8% heating oil and diesel fuels</li><li class=\"p1\">13.8% other products like wax, synthetic rubber, and plastics</li><li class=\"p1\">9.5% jet fuel (kerosene)</li><li class=\"p1\">2.0% asphalt</li></ul><p>The United States is by far the biggest consumer of oil in the world, consuming over 20% of the world’s oil and about double the next biggest consumer. The US is also one of the three biggest oil producers in the world, alongside Saudi Arabia and Russia, who all produce roughly the same amount.<a href=\"#footnote-6-3667\" id=\"note-6-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p><strong>Natural gas</strong>, which is formed when underground oil gets to a super-high temperature and vaporizes, is found in underground pockets, usually in the vicinity of oil reserves. The &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of the three fossil fuels, it&#8217;s the gas that fires up your stove or heats your apartment (if those aren’t electricity-powered or heated by oil), and it&#8217;s one of the major sources of electricity (it makes up about 20% of electricity in the US). Natural gas is on the rise and now makes up almost a quarter of the world’s energy. One of the reasons it’s on the rise is that scientists have found a new way of extracting natural gas from the Earth called hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” which uses a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals to create cracks in natural gas-rich shale and force out the gas. This method has been hugely effective, but it’s also controversial because of some serious environmental concerns—<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> explains it well.</p></div><p>As for the reasons people argue that fossil fuels are problematic, we&#8217;re going to focus on the two most common—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>ISSUE 1: Climate Change is a Thing</strong></span></p><p>Let&#8217;s ignore all the politicians and professors and CEOs and filmmakers and look at three facts:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 1) Burning Fossil Fuels Makes Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Rise</strong></span></p><p>We&#8217;ll get to the data in a second, but first—why does burning fossil fuels emit CO<sub>2</sub>?</p><p>The answer is simple: <strong>combustion is reverse photosynthesis.</strong></p><p>When a plant grows, it makes its own food through photosynthesis. At its most oversimplified, during photosynthesis, the plant takes CO<sub>2</sub> from the air<a href=\"#footnote-7-3667\" id=\"note-7-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> and absorbs light energy from the sun to split the CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon (C) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The plant keeps the carbon and emits the oxygen as a waste product. The sun&#8217;s light energy stays in the plant as chemical energy the plant can use.</p><p>So wood is essentially a block of carbon and stored chemical energy.</p><p>When you burn a log, all you&#8217;re doing is reversing the photosynthesis. Normally, oxygen in the air just bounces off carbon molecules in wood—that&#8217;s why trees aren&#8217;t constantly on fire. But when an oxygen molecule gets moving fast enough and <em>smashes </em>into a log&#8217;s carbon molecule, they <em>snap</em> together and the oxygen and carbon are reunited again as CO<sub>2</sub>. This snapping releases chemical energy, which knocks into other nearby oxygen molecules, causing <em>them </em>to get going fast—and if they get going fast enough, they&#8217;ll snap together with another of the log&#8217;s carbon molecules, which releases <em>more</em> chemical energy. This causes a chain reaction, and the log is now on fire. So a log burning is the process of the carbon in the log combining with oxygen in the air and floating off as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Of course, that&#8217;s all irrelevant to the person burning the log—what <em>they </em>care about is the <em>energy </em>released during all of this CO<sub>2 </sub>formation. The release of all of the log&#8217;s stored chemical energy creates a glorious blaze of heat and light. The tree spent years quietly absorbing carbon<sub> </sub>molecules and sunshine joules, and all at once, during combustion, that carbon and sunshine explode back out into the world.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3667\" id=\"note-8-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><p>To put it another way, photosynthesis just kidnaps carbon and sun energy out of the atmosphere, and after years of holding them hostage, combustion sets them both free—the carbon as a billowing eruption of newly reunited CO<sub>2</sub>, and the sun energy as fire—meaning that fire is essentially just tightly packed sunshine.</p><p>But burning a log and releasing all that CO<sub>2 </sub>does <em>not </em>tamper with the atmosphere&#8217;s carbon levels. Why? Because the carbon that&#8217;s being released was recently <em>in</em> the atmosphere, and if you hadn&#8217;t set the log on fire, it would have likely decomposed, which would release the carbon back into the world anyway. The log&#8217;s carbon was only being held <em>temporarily</em> hostage, and releasing it through combustion has little effect.</p><p>Carbon flows from the atmosphere into plants and animals, into the ground and water, and then back out of all those things into the atmosphere—that&#8217;s called the carbon cycle. At any given point in time, the Earth&#8217;s active carbon cycle contains a specific amount of carbon. Burning a log doesn&#8217;t change that level because the carbon cycle &#8220;expects&#8221; that carbon to be hanging around the ground, water, or air.</p><p>But sometimes, a small portion of carbon in the cycle drops <em>out </em>of the cycle for the long term—it happens when a plant or animal dies but for some reason <em>doesn&#8217;t </em>decay normally. Instead, before it can decay and release its carbon back into the cycle, it&#8217;s buried underground. Over time, that lost carbon adds up. And today, the Earth&#8217;s fossil fuels make up a huge mass of lost carbon—carbon that long ago was taken hostage <em>permanently</em>, and carbon that the carbon cycle does <em>not </em>expect to be involved in its routine.</p><p>When humans discovered all of this underground kidnapped carbon, you have to remember that for them, the carbon wasn&#8217;t the point. They were staring at an endless sea of 300 million-year-old, densely packed sunshine—trillions of ancient plants with their <em>joules</em><em> intact</em>—and since there are no laws protecting the estates of Carboniferous plants, we could seize it all for ourselves. The grandest joule theft in history.</p><p>And as we helped ourselves, we didn&#8217;t worry about the fact that extracting those joules also meant extracting carbon that had been buried as far back as the Precambrian period—there were locomotives to fuel and cars to power and buildings to heat, and the joules were irresistible.</p><p>And those joules have gone a long way—you can thank them for the comforts and quality of your life today. But those carbon molecules have gone a long way too.</p><p>Starting in 1958, scientist Charles Keeling started measuring atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels from an observatory on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Those measurements are still going on today. Here&#8217;s what they show:<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3667\" id=\"note2-7-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3790 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png\" alt=\"Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg\" width=\"475\" height=\"475\" /></a></p><p>The zig-zaggy motion of the line is due to the level falling each year in the summer when plants are sucking up CO<sub>2</sub> and rising up again during the winter when the leaves are dead. But the overarching trend is unmistakable. To put that into context, ice drilling technology<a href=\"#footnote-9-3667\" id=\"note-9-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> allows scientists to collect accurate data on what CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been throughout the last 400,000 years. Here&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve found:<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3667\" id=\"note2-8-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3707 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png\" alt=\"co2_variations\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" /></a></p><p>So atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels have oscillated<a href=\"#footnote-10-3667\" id=\"note-10-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> between about 180 and 300 parts per million over the last 400,000 years, never eclipsing 300, and suddenly in the last century the level has vaulted up to 400 (it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://co2now.org/\" target=\"_blank\">currently</a> at 403ppm).</p><p>So instead of the atmosphere being .02% or .03% carbon, it&#8217;s now .04% carbon and maybe moving towards .05% and higher. But let&#8217;s not judge anything yet. All we know is Fact #1, which tells us that CO<sub>2</sub> levels are rising quickly.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 2) Where Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Go, Temperatures Follow</strong></span></p><p>The ice cores dug up by scientists don&#8217;t just reveal the CO<sub>2</sub> levels going backwards in time—they reveal temperature too. Here&#8217;s what they show:<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3667\" id=\"note2-9-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3812\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png\" alt=\"temp graph\" width=\"538\" height=\"268\" /></a></p><p>Not a hard correlation to see. The reason for this is simple—CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas. The way an actual greenhouse works is the glass lets in sun energy and traps a lot of it inside as heat. There are a handful of chemicals in our atmosphere that do the same thing—sun rays come in, bounce off the Earth, and they&#8217;re on their way out when the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere block some of them and spread them through the atmosphere, warming things up.</p><p>Mars has an average temperature of -55ºC (-67ºF), which isn&#8217;t fun, but Venus is literally actual hell, with an average temperature of 462ºC (864ºF). No one is more of a dick than Venus. Why? CO<sub>2</sub>. Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth so the sun&#8217;s energy easily escapes, while Venus&#8217;s atmosphere is much thicker, with <em>300 times</em> the CO<sub>2</sub> as Earth, so it traps in a ton of heat. Mercury is <em>closer</em> to the sun than Venus, but with no atmosphere, it&#8217;s cooler than Venus. During the day, Mercury gets almost as hot as Venus, but at night it gets freezing, while Venus is just as hot at night as it is during the day, because the heat lives permanently in its thick atmosphere.</p><p>So it makes sense that an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> here would increase temperature—but by how much? When compared to the Pre-Industrial average temperature, our current average temperature has risen by a little less than 1ºC. But as CO<sub>2 </sub>levels keep rising, most scientists expect temperatures to keep rising. The UN-supported Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from a bunch of different countries, came out with <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> that laid out the temperature projections of a number of independent labs. This is what those labs think will happen if no action is taken to alter the current trends in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3667\" id=\"note2-10-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3715 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png\" alt=\"Global_Warming_Predictions\" width=\"398\" height=\"284\" /></a></p><p>A small minority argue that these future projections are overblown—they <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/fossil-fuels-will-save-the-world-really-1426282420\" target=\"_blank\">point out</a> that they ride on the largely accepted theory that water vapor in the atmosphere multiplies the effect of carbon emissions because of a &#8220;feedback&#8221; loop, whereby a small increase in temperature from extra CO<sub>2 </sub>increases water evaporation, and since water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, that creates more warmth, which further increases more evaporation, and on and on. Without this feedback loop, the temperature increases resulting from CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions would be 2-3 times smaller. But even the greatest skeptics usually agree that CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions do lead to temperature increases.</p><p>The IPCC also puts it at over 90% that the changes in both CO<sub>2 </sub>levels and temperature are caused by human activity (which is kind of like saying there&#8217;s over a 90% chance that a rain storm has been caused by cloud activity). Now the question becomes—how much does the temperature need to change to make everything shitty?</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Fact 3) The Temperature Doesn&#8217;t Need to Change Very Much to Make Everything Shitty</strong></span></p><p>18,000 years ago, global temperatures were about 5ºC lower than the 20th century average. That was enough to put Canada, Scandinavia, and half of England and the US under a half a mile of ice. That&#8217;s what 5ºC can do.<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3667\" id=\"note2-11-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a><p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3702 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"550\" height=\"210\" /></p><p>100 million years ago, temperatures were 6-10ºC higher than they are now—and every region of the Earth was tropical, there was no permanent ice anywhere, ocean levels were <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142729/Cretaceous-Period\" target=\"_blank\">200 meters</a> higher, and this kind of shit was happening:<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3667\" id=\"note2-12-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3810\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg\" alt=\"T-rex-120501\" width=\"297\" height=\"327\" /></a></p><p>So we&#8217;re currently in this not-that-big window we probably should try to stay in:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3763\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png\" alt=\"temp spectrum\" width=\"647\" height=\"303\" /></a></p><p>This is also even more fragile than is intuitive. First, you don&#8217;t need the <em>average</em> temperature to go up by a catastrophic amount to have a catastrophe—because the average temp could go up by only 3ºC but the <em>max </em>temp rises by a lot more. Just <em>one day</em> at an outlier high like 58ºC (136ºF) would wipe out most of the Earth&#8217;s crops and animals. Second, because the total range of temperature a planet can be goes all the way down to absolute zero: -273ºC (-459ºF). So a difference of 5ºC, enough to bury the northern part of the world under an ocean of ice, is really only about a 1.5% fluctuation in temperature—not something like 10%, which is what it seems like. Looking at the window on a spectrum that shows the full range emphasizes that the world we&#8217;re used to is what it is only because of a very specific and delicate balance of conditions.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3782\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"temp spectrum 2\" width=\"683\" height=\"255\" /></a></p><p>As mentioned above, right now, the average temp is edging upwards to 1ºC above the Pre-Industrial norm (the IPCC <a href=\"http://www.climatechange2013.org/\" target=\"_blank\">puts us</a> at +.86ºC currently). Scientists debate how high that number can go before really dramatic changes start to happen. For the last 20 years, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7242/full/nature08017.html\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 countries</a> have agreed to try to limit global warming to a 2ºC increase, but there are all of these different opinions going around about that. Regarding the effects of a 2ºC increase, in my research, I came across some credible sources saying 2º is an unnecessarily low ceiling and that that we can afford to safely go higher and others saying that 2º is <em>too</em> high a target and that we&#8217;re underestimating how catastrophic a change of 2º would be. Regarding our ability to stay under 2º, I&#8217;ve also heard varying opinions—some think we can stay under 2º with proper restrictions; others think there&#8217;s no possible way we can stay under 2º—that there&#8217;s enough upward momentum already that even if we stopped creating carbon emissions in the next few years, the Earth would keep warming past 2º.</p><p>So what are we supposed to make of this?</p><p>Our goal today is <em>not </em>to dig deep into these conflicting opinions and try to figure out the truth, because no one knows for sure anyway. We&#8217;re not going to talk about specific things like sea levels, pollution, storms, or that polar bear in the video who&#8217;s extra sad because his ice is melting.

A common counter to those sources is that even without running out, we could face a serious problem if the extraction of the fuels becomes more and more difficult and expensive over time.</p><p>The problem with running out, whenever it happens, is that if the world is anywhere near as reliant on fossil fuels at that point as we are now, it&#8217;ll cause an epic economic collapse.

(The charts look icky and confusing at first, but they&#8217;re actually really simple—just showing how much of each source is used and how that source is broken up among sectors.)</p><p>Here&#8217;s the<strong> combined world energy flow </strong>in 2007:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/World-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3802\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/World-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"World-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"592\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/World-2007.png\"><br /></a><br />
The unit, PJ, is in petajoules. 1 petajoule = 1 quadrillion joules. Some thoughts:</p><p>&#8211; The most consistent fact I noticed about all countries is how much petroleum (i.e. crude oil) dominates the transportation sector. 94% of the world&#8217;s transportation runs on oil, and in most developed countries, the percentage is even higher.</p><p>&#8211; Biomass use is pretty substantial, and almost all of it comes from developing countries, many of them in Africa. Biomass is typically the burning of things like wood, oil distilled down from food like corn, and manure.</p><p>&#8211; That&#8217;s a whole lot of rejected energy on the right side. Rejected energy is energy we lose, usually in the form of heat, due to inefficiency. Especially unimpressive is the transportation performance, where engines only end up using a quarter of the fuel they burn.</p><p>Next, let&#8217;s look at<strong> France:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3803\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"France-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"603\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/France-2007.png\"><br /></a><br />
Thoughts:</p><p>&#8211; Lots of nuclear, and as a result, very little coal. That makes France a pretty light CO<sub>2</sub> emitter.</p><p>&#8211; Their transportation, though, is like everyone else&#8217;s—running on oil.</p><p>&#8211; France is an example of a factor we&#8217;re not going to discuss in this post, but an important one: <strong>fossil fuels are a bit of a geopolitical nightmare</strong>. Nation interdependence can be productive and important, but nations being dependent on other nations for their <em>survival</em> is never a great thing, and the need to import fossil fuels is one of the major reasons for modern nation ultra-dependency. France is totally reliant on oil for its transportation and totally reliant on other countries for oil—this puts them in a vulnerable position. The US isn&#8217;t as dependent. It relied on other nations for 60% of its oil a decade ago but has since become one of the top three oil-producing countries, and the EIA <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/\" target=\"_blank\">projects</a> net oil imports to make up only 21% of the US&#8217;s 2015 oil consumption. I was also surprised <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_m.htm\" target=\"_blank\">to see</a> that only a small portion of US oil imports were from the Middle East, with only 12.5% of them coming from Saudi Arabia and 20% from the entire combined Persian Gulf. Far more was from the Western Hemisphere, with Canada by far the largest at 37% of imports and Mexico and Venezuela also prominent at 9% each.</p><p>Okay and how about <strong>China?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/China-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3804\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/China-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"China-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\" /></a><br />
China is an energy monster, mostly because they&#8217;re an industrial monster. They&#8217;re also a coal-burning beast, burning through almost half of the world&#8217;s <em>total</em> coal consumption each year. That 57,000 PJ of coal consumption number is insane—over five times France&#8217;s total energy flow.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3805\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi-Arabia-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"598\" /></a><br />
Kind of a one-trick pony.</p><p>North Korea&#8217;s energy flow is, unsurprisingly, just weird:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3806\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"North-Korea-2007-copy-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"589\" /></a><br />

Two things that stand out:</p><p>&#8211; The US has become a natural gas consumption beast and by far the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/?view=consumption\" target=\"_blank\">biggest one</a> in the world.</p><p>&#8211; The US is even <em>more </em>of an oil-consumption beast—almost double the <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/?view=consumption\" target=\"_blank\">second biggest</a> oil-consuming country, China, and more than four times #3 on the list, Japan.</p><p>To put in perspective how much energy the US uses, I found a country in the world that uses a similar amount of energy as each US state:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Energy-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3837\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Energy-Map.jpg\" alt=\"Energy Map\" width=\"900\" height=\"575\" /></a></p><p>Finally, let&#8217;s go back to the reason we started with these charts in the first place—to figure out how we&#8217;re gonna get from the black part of the timeline to the yellow and out of the fossil fuels area. The LLNL also produces a chart showing the US carbon emissions and where they come from. The US is the world&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8\" target=\"_blank\">second biggest</a> carbon emissions culprit (China is first with 50% more than the US) and the world leader in transportation emissions—so if we can figure out what the US needs to fix, that&#8217;s a good start.</p><p>Getting from the black to the yellow means getting rid of carbon emissions. Looking at the US emissions flowchart, I see two glaring numbers:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"US-Emissions-2013-compressor\" width=\"900\" height=\"594\" /></a></p><p>There are many things that need to happen to get us into the yellow zone, but these two figures—which make up 72% of total US emissions—seem like the biggest and most urgent problems to address:</p><p>1) Electricity production throughout the world makes up about 40% of the total energy flow, and roughly two thirds of electricity production comes from burning carbon-emitting fossil fuels, most prominently coal. Or, put simply: <strong>Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty.</strong></p><p>2) Transportation makes up a large chunk of the world&#8217;s energy flow, including near a third in most developed countries, and almost all the world&#8217;s transportation runs on petroleum. Put simply: <strong>Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve spent this post zoomed far out on all of this. Now it&#8217;s time to zoom in, and we&#8217;ll zoom in on the second major problem listed above—transportation, and in particular, cars. Transportation covers planes, trains, ships, trucks, and cars—but cars cause more carbon emissions than the other four combined, and without major changes, car emissions are <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAG&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FMcKinsey%2Fdotcom%2Fclient_service%2FSustainability%2FPDFs%2Froads_toward_low_carbon_future_new.ashx&amp;ei=YbRbVbKpHpDZgwTv1oHgCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3SEeN0mjEnhTVGWEcgP3FFGFzDg&amp;sig2=Ycq_mTE6XiZBtnFhiqOB0Q\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to rise by over 50% by 2030. By zooming in on one major piece of this puzzle—car emissions—and examining how it became a problem, why it&#8217;s still a problem, and the way we might solve that problem, we&#8217;ll get a better sense of what this entire struggle is really made of.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part2\"></a>Part 2: The Story of Cars</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Cars.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3779\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Cars.png\" alt=\"Story of Cars\" width=\"200\" height=\"176\" /></a></p><p>Meet the world&#8217;s first car owner.<a href=\"#footnote2-15-3667\" id=\"note2-15-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3703 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress.jpg\" alt=\"640px-Portrait_of_the_Kangxi_Emperor_in_Court_Dress\" width=\"272\" height=\"453\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s the Chinese Emperor, Kangxi, in his driving clothes.

Edison&#8217;s company was busy rolling out electrical generating systems to power US cities, and working on these, Ford got good at working with the steam-powered engines the company used to make electricity. In his spare time, Ford sat in a little workshop next to his home playing around with the still-novel concept of the internal combustion engine, and in 1896, at the age of 32, he came up with what he called the Ford Quadricycle, powered by a simple internal combustion engine.<a href=\"#footnote2-24-3667\" id=\"note2-24-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">24</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3822\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"FordQuadricycle-compressor\" width=\"500\" height=\"405\" /></a></p><p>Becoming increasingly obsessed with building self-propelled vehicles, Ford quit his job in 1899 and first formed the Detroit Automobile Company, which failed, before forming the Henry Ford company in 1901. But Ford soon left the company over a dispute with the company&#8217;s investors, who then renamed it Cadillac Automobile Company, and in 1903, he went on to partner with a guy named Alexander Malcomson to create a company called Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd., which was later renamed Ford Motor Company. Super annoying for Malcomson.</p><p>Ford and his new company charged ahead making gas-powered cars, but at the time, gas cars were hardly the norm. Cars were a new technology, and at the beginning of the century, 40% of American cars were powered by steam and 38% were electric—gas cars only made up 22% of the American market.</p><p>These numbers make sense. Steam-centered external combustion was the older and best-understood technology of the three and was initially the most common way to power a car. Its fancier new cousin, the internal combustion engine, powered by burning gasoline, cut out the middleman and burned fuel more efficiently. But it&#8217;s no surprise that the quickest up-and-comer type of car was the electric car. It was 1900 and electricity was at the core of all the coolest, newest technology.</p><p>The 35 years between the mid-1860s and the turn of the century had just witnessed an electricity revolution, driven by inventors like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, and George Westinghouse, during which the world went from normal to positively <em>magical</em>. The first magic happened in the middle of the century, when the telegraph used long-range electricity to communicate with people really far away, and in 1866, the first successful cross-Atlantic telegraph message was sent, allowing Europe and the US to magically communicate with each other <em>instantly</em>. The magic revolution hit full force in the late 1870s. The first telephone call happened in 1876, followed by the first time in human history someone could record sound and then play it back, in 1877. Light bulbs began to light up city streets in the early 1880s, and by 1896, the first electrical grid brought widespread electricity into people&#8217;s homes. Also in 1896, the first primitive motion picture went on display in New York, and the first wireless transmission of a human voice—the birth of the radio—went through in Brazil in 1900. Meanwhile, magical horseless cars were appearing on the streets, and only a few years later, in 1903, the Wright Brothers would take humanity&#8217;s first heavier-than-air flight. It&#8217;s hard to imagine how <i>insanely cool </i>a time this must have been for everyone.</p><p>And if you were alive around the year 1900, you&#8217;d probably equate modern tech with electricity, much the way we today equate modern tech with computers, smart phones and the internet. Edison and Tesla were their Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. The idea of powering transportation with a fiery engine dated back to the earliest locomotives almost 100 years earlier, which would seem about as modern to a person in 1900 as black-and-white silent films seem to us today. By 1900, you weren&#8217;t supposed to have to deal with how the energy sausage is really made anymore—the burning fire happened in some remote generator now, allowing consumers to only have to interact with the silent, clean, convenient magical butler—electricity.</p><p>So if someone in the year 1900 had to bet on the outcome of the battle between external steam combustion, internal gasoline combustion, and electricity as the future standard for powering cars, they&#8217;d have probably put their money on electricity. And at the time, electricity was not only winning the battle over gasoline with far more cars on the road, but the world&#8217;s most prominent inventors, including Edison and Tesla, were pouring their efforts into an electric car future. Early in the century, the New York Times referred to the electric car as &#8220;ideal,&#8221; citing it as quieter, cleaner, and more economical than the gas car.<a href=\"#footnote2-25-3667\" id=\"note2-25-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">25</a><p>But <em>ideal</em> wasn&#8217;t the driving force of the early auto industry—<em>scalable</em> was. Cars were, up until that point, fairly impractical toys for rich people. There would be time to idealize everything later—the first step was to figure out how to make the car fast, sturdy, and most importantly, affordable. Money and brains poured into car technology from all over the world, and in 1908, Henry Ford and his five-year-old company came out with the car that launched the automotive industry into the stratosphere: The Model T.<a href=\"#footnote2-26-3667\" id=\"note2-26-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">26</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3737 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg\" alt=\"1908-model-t-ford\" width=\"491\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>Before the Model T, there had been big problems with both electric and gas vehicles. Electric had shorter ranges and longer refueling times. Gas cars were loud, hard to start, and spewed smoke like it was 1802.</p><p>But Ford was a masterful industrialist, and by coming up with the concept of making cars by moving assembly line instead of hand-crafting them, he dramatically brought down costs and created America&#8217;s first car for the masses. In 1912, engineer Charles Kettering invented the electric car starter, eliminating the need to laboriously and dangerously hand crank your gas car on, and the newly invented muffler significantly reduced gas engine noise. Suddenly, a lot of the things that sucked about gas cars didn&#8217;t suck anymore—and they had become much cheaper than electric cars. Ford&#8217;s Model T took over America, and by 1914, 99% of new American cars ran on gas. By 1920, electric cars dropped entirely out of commercial production.<a href=\"#footnote2-27-3667\" id=\"note2-27-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">27</a><p>This was not an inevitable outcome. The future of cars had been up for grabs, and Ford had simply outsmarted his competition. Burning fuel was the way of the past and electricity was the way of the future—but Ford had created a provable, profitable business model for making cars, one that didn&#8217;t yet exist for electric cars, and it quickly became too much of an uphill battle for electric car makers to try to turn the tide. So they stopped.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Now it&#8217;s a century later. The most primitive local telephone call through a wire has become a person in Delhi being able to take a slab of glass out of his pocket, tap it with his finger, and instantly be talking to, and looking at, his friend in Sao Paulo. The grainiest, choppiest black-and-white silent movies have become Pixar. Mixing chemicals in a lab has become splitting atoms in the Large Hadron Collider. The Wright Brothers&#8217; 12 second, 120-foot flight has become routine trips 250 miles up to the International Space Station.</p><p>But instead of me finishing that paragraph with, &#8220;The primitive gas-burning car has become [something rad we can&#8217;t even imagine],&#8221; I have to finish it with, &#8220;The primitive gas-burning car has become the better gas-burning car.&#8221;</p><p>As I said, if you were alive in 1900, you&#8217;d have probably thought the idea of an AC induction electric car motor was awesome and futuristic, and the internal combustion engine, which was only an incremental advance from the early locomotive steam engines invented a century earlier, was kind of cool but not especially futuristic. But we&#8217;re not alive in 1900, we&#8217;re alive in 2015, so when <em>we </em>look at the modern gas engine that&#8217;s in all of our cars, and we see <em>pistons </em>moving back and forth because of something hot exploding inside their cylinders—<a href=\"#footnote2-28-3667\" id=\"note2-28-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">28</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3716 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif\" alt=\"img11\" width=\"490\" height=\"347\" /></a></p><p>—they should seem <em>outrageously ancient</em>. Quick aside:</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Tim Makes Passionate Car People Even More Furious By Describing How a Car Engine Works in a Clearly-Non-Car-Person Way Blue Box</strong></span></p><p>Welcome to the Tim Makes Passionate Car People Even More Furious By Describing How a Car Engine Works in a Clearly-Non-Car-Person Way Blue Box. Here&#8217;s the deal:</p><p>The animation above is of a four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. The four cylinders are those four tubes the pistons are moving up and down inside of. Each time a piston slides up or down, that&#8217;s called a stroke, and the fuel-burning happens in a four-stroke cycle:</p><p><strong>1) The Intake Stroke:</strong> This is the part where the piston is moving down and there&#8217;s blue stuff above it. The blue stuff is air that&#8217;s being sucked in along with a small amount of gasoline that&#8217;s fired in at just the right time by the fuel injector.</p><p><strong>2) The Compression Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke where the piston moves up and as it does, the blue stuff turns orange. What&#8217;s happening is that the valve that let the air in on the intake stroke has now closed and as the piston moves up, there&#8217;s nowhere for the air/gas mixture to go, so it just compresses really tightly.</p><p><strong>3) The Power Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke I feel like passionate car men talk about with a little twinkle in their eye. In the animation, this is where the piston moves down and there&#8217;s orange above it which then turns gray by the end. The previous compression stroke has squeezed the air and gas tightly, and at the top of that stroke, the spark plug at the top of the cylinder emits a spark which ignites the compressed air and gas on fire and creates a little explosion. This explosion blows the piston back downwards. This stroke is where the power of the car engine comes from.</p><p><strong>4) The Exhaust Stroke: </strong>This is the part where the piston pushes the gray stuff up and out of the cylinder. The gray stuff is exhaust—i.e. smoke because you just lit a campfire in that cylinder—that then makes its way out of the car&#8217;s tailpipe. This smoke consists of mostly non-toxic gases with a little carbon monoxide and other poison mixed in for fun. Also in the exhaust is the carbon dioxide that just got created during the explosion, which allows the long-buried carbon in the gasoline to happily re-enter the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere after the most boring 300 million years ever underground.</p><p>The furious back-and-forth motion of the pistons work together to forcefully turn what&#8217;s called a crankshaft—that metal bar contraption they&#8217;re all connected to below—which creates the turning motion that eventually turns the car&#8217;s wheel axles. I think.<a href=\"#footnote-11-3667\" id=\"note-11-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a><p>(For more info: first two minutes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA_19bHxEYg\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> shows this all in action, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W_NRHxekaY\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> is aesthetically pleasing.)</p></div><p>Now.

And this is one of them.</p><p>So the question we need to ask is why.</p><p>If electric motors were the more advanced technology—if they were considered <em>ideal</em> because they were quiet, clean, and took advantage of cutting edge technology—why did the world give up on them? In 1900, neither electric nor gas cars were viable for mass adoption—both needed a few key technological breakthroughs. The key breakthroughs needed for gas cars happened <em>first</em>—but why was that reason for us to just settle, <em>permanently</em>, for the more primitive technology and the one that, over time, would make our cities smoggy and change the chemical makeup of our atmosphere? If 20th-century human invention could go from the Wright Brothers&#8217; 12-second flight to the moon in just 66 years, surely advancing battery technology enough to bring electric car prices and charging times down while increasing range shouldn&#8217;t have been beyond our scope. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why did innovation and progress in something as important to the world as car-powering technology just <em>stop</em>?</span></p><p>This question could be asked about other parts of the bigger story of the Fossil Fuels Era. You could just as easily puzzle over the question, &#8220;America&#8217;s first electricity power station, Edison&#8217;s Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, first lit up in 1882, powered by burning coal—how is it possible that in 2015, burning coal is still by far the primary way humanity produces electricity even though we&#8217;ve known for decades that it&#8217;s not an optimal or sustainable long-term method?&#8221;</p><p>The problem with the question &#8220;Why did X technology stop moving forward?&#8221; is that it&#8217;s misunderstanding how progress works. Instead of asking why technological progress sometimes <em>stops</em>, we have to ask the question:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em>Why does technological progress ever happen at all? </em></span></p><p>The mistake of the first question is the intuitive but incorrect notion that technology naturally moves forward on its own over time—it doesn&#8217;t. I can tell you this for sure, because my Time Warner DVR has the exact same horrible user interface it had in 2004. The way technology works is that by default, it stands still, and it moves forward only when something <em>pushes </em>it forward.</p><p>We often have the same intuitive misconception when we think about evolution. Natural selection doesn&#8217;t make things &#8220;better&#8221;—it just optimizes biology to best survive in whatever environmental circumstances it finds itself. When something in that environment changes—a predator mutates and becomes faster, a certain type of food becomes scarce, an ice age rolls in—it means species that were previously optimized to the environment no longer are. The environmental change alters the natural selection criteria, which applies a <em>pressure </em>on the species as it is, and over time, the genetics of the species will react to the pressure by changing in order to optimize to the new environment.</p><p>When it comes to technology, a totally free and open market is the natural environment. But unlike the world of species, which is the eternal Wild West, human societies have another factor in play—a god-type force called government. So if we&#8217;re trying to figure out what makes technology move and change, we have to look at <em>two</em> sources of pressure: natural market conditions that ebb and flow and apply continual new pressures on all the actors within, and the &#8220;god&#8221; on top who can artificially change the environment below to create manufactured pressures. Let&#8217;s examine both, starting with government:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) Pressure From Government-Induced Environment Changes</strong></span></p><p>The nature and power of a market&#8217;s government-god varies significantly throughout the world. In North Korea, it is a Biblical-style, all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful ruler of the universe to the point where there <em>is</em> no natural market environment—just the one god created and maintains. In Scandinavia, god is a wealthy power mom and the market is nestled in her warm bosom of safety and opportunity. In Central Africa, god made a lifestyle change and got a new job, working for the wealthiest families—huge step up the ladder for him.</p><p>In the US, god has an identity crisis, alternating between feelings of pride and self-loathing. It wants to have the best country, but it&#8217;s standing on the street corner alone yelling out in an argument with itself about the right way to do that. When the US government (or a government like it) wants to play god and alter the American natural market environment to apply certain pressures in certain places, it uses three main tools: funding, regulation, and taxes.</p><p><strong>Funding: </strong>In order for government funding to lead to major progress, there has to be a lot of it, and in an open democracy, that only flies when the nation needs to do something so important that everyone agrees on it—like in the 1960s, when the fear of losing global influence kicked the US government&#8217;s adrenaline in and it put a man on the moon. Likewise, significant US military funding is something the American electorate can agree on enough that it receives tremendous funding and plays an important part in advancing technology in a number of industries. In most cases, though, a divided democracy is too paralyzed by conflicting interests and political squabbling to be the main driver of a serious tech revolution.</p><p><strong>Regulation: </strong>Another democratic government muscle is its ability to make rules—laws, restrictions, quotas, etc. These can be effective at pushing through minor changes—the seatbelt and airbag are both products of government regulation. But at least when it comes to the car industry, I&#8217;m having a hard time thinking of instances of major technological <em>leaps</em> caused by government regulation.</p><p><strong>Tax Code: </strong>The government often uses the tax code to add its own economic pressures into the free market. Again though, while this can be effective for <em>nudging </em>something in a certain direction, it doesn&#8217;t tend to lead to sweeping advances.</p><p>Of course, America is in a big fight about this, with fiscal liberals typically feeling a lot more optimistic about government&#8217;s ability to play a positive role in moving things forward than fiscal conservatives. But I think both would agree that major tech progress being <em>forced </em>forward<em> </em>by the government is more the way of places like the Soviet Union and modern-day China where government has a lot more power. The incredible innovation that often emerges from open democracies tends to come from pressures from below, in the bubbling cauldron of the free market—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) Pressures From Natural Market Forces</strong> </span></p><p>In the natural world, to catch food and stay away from predators, animals will optimize by becoming fast and elusive runners. When food on the ground becomes scarce, species will feel the pressure of hunger and over time, their genetics will re-optimize by developing good bodies for climbing or long necks or wings. A running species that becomes a flying species hasn&#8217;t become <em>better—</em>just better fit for the current circumstances. In the world of species, the definition of optimization is simple because the end goals are simple: the core needs of biological creatures are always the same—to self-preserve and reproduce. So optimization in the natural world always has the same definition: to adjust in a way that makes you mostly likely to self-preserve and reproduce.</p><p>In order to understand what optimization means in the market, we need to know what the core goals are of the actors there. Of course, people are also biological creatures, and self-preservation will always be at the top of the list—if you&#8217;re hungry, cold, or sick, fixing that will be the core goal. But for people whose base needs are being met, what are the yearning desires that then lie at the core of their motivation? What does &#8220;pursuing your self-interest&#8221; mean for them?</p><p>Well, it depends on the culture. In certain cultures, the fear of failure is so strong that it outweighs desires like glory or great fortune, and the primary inner drive becomes to just make sure you&#8217;re passable. In others, the deepest drive of the people might be religious salvation, community or family service, a leisurely lifestyle, or spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>When it comes to technological advancement, those motivations aren&#8217;t likely to get you there because thinking up tech innovations isn&#8217;t a helpful step on the path to optimization for those people. So if we want tech progress, what kind of yearning do we want people to feel?</p><p>I think the ideal mix is a two-part cocktail:</p><p><strong>First ingredient: Greed. </strong>In a perfect, fair, open market, greed works great as the core lifeblood motivation. The way capitalism theoretically works is that the more real-world value you create, the more money you&#8217;ll make. So companies in a competitive landscape will put their effort into creating better and better products and services in order to optimize, which for them means making as much money as they possibly can. Individual people are greedy as a means to all kinds of ends—a lavish lifestyle, personal freedom, security, admiration, power, sex—but <em>what</em> they want is irrelevant. As long as their burning desire makes them <em>really want stuff</em>, their drive to optimize will move technology forward. Greed is a double-edged sword though—to be beneficial, greed has to be contained inside a high-integrity, meritocratic, free market. If it&#8217;s not, greed will turn into the enemy of progress, because the more vulnerable the system is to corruption, the more the greedy on top will be able to game the system to ensure their own long-lasting victory.</p><p><strong>Second ingredient: Raging ambition.</strong> Greed can lead to steady forward progress, but in order for progress to <em>leap </em>forward, a second ingredient is usually key: a burning desire to do something great. Again, the underlying reasons for this kind of ambition can vary. Sometimes it&#8217;ll be an ego-driven desire—to be famous and renowned, to leave one&#8217;s mark, to be thought of and posthumously remembered as <em>great</em>. Other times the ambition will be fueled by a borderline-insane level of confidence and optimism that gives someone the gall to be idealistic. These are the yearnings of the <em>hungry underdog. </em></p><p>An established industry full of existing winners running on greed is like the highest layer of trees in a crowded rainforest. They&#8217;ll push upward only as needed, elbowing each other for little gains and victories as they vie for sunlight, mostly just trying to keep their spot in the canopy. Greed just wants sunlight—it doesn&#8217;t care how high up it is when it gets it.</p><p>But below, the hungry underdog <em>burns</em> for sunlight and will spend 100 hours a week trying to figure out how to get it. When the breakthrough comes, the underdog <em>bursts </em>up through the canopy into the open sky and spreads its leaves out wide. Suddenly, the trees that had been on top are blocked from the sun. Greed is then replaced by the much more powerful drive of <i>survival</i>, and innovation kicks into high gear as they scramble upwards for their life. The environment has changed—it&#8217;s been <i>disrupted</i>—and in this new world, created by the underdog disruptor, companies have to innovate in order to re-optimize. Some end up back on top, others die—and at the end of it all, technology has jolted forward. We all witnessed an example of this when Apple rocketed through the mobile phone canopy in 2007 and forced all of the other companies to make a smartphone or die. Samsung managed to get itself back into the sun. Nokia did not.</p><p>With all this in mind, let&#8217;s go back to the car industry and our original question:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Why hasn&#8217;t the car technology forest moved upward over the past century?</strong> </span></p><p>I see two primary reasons:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) Insanely high barriers to entry—so no leaps forward caused by hungry underdogs</strong></span></p><p>Try to think of something ickier and harder than starting a car company.</p><p>First, before you can sell one product, you&#8217;ll need to put down an absurd amount of capital to buy a factory, figure out how to design a car and all of its parts, build a prototype, use that to raise a lot more money, get a much bigger factory and hire thousands of people, and pump many millions of dollars into marketing to tell the world that your company exists. And you probably need to be incredibly rich and risk-tolerant yourself since very few people are zany enough to invest money in a startup car company.</p><p>Second, in order to be profitable, you have to sell at a high volume. Cars are too expensive to make and margins are too thin to only sell a few each year. So for this to be a good idea, you not only have to create an awesome car, but one that a ton of people will want to buy.</p><p>Third, gas cars are already well-optimized—if you want to aggressively burst through the canopy like an underdog without any brand awareness needs to, you have to create a <em>much better type of car than what&#8217;s out there</em>. In the case of cars, that probably means addressing the core of the car itself and the thing that&#8217;s been stressing everyone out with its billowing emissions—the engine. But since no one has really done this yet, it means you need to not only create the first successful startup car company in a long time, you need to create the first startup to <em>ever </em>succeed at making whatever type of car you&#8217;re creating. And since you&#8217;ll be there first to do it, you&#8217;ll have to put a huge amount of time and money into innovation research and development and bear the brunt of the invention costs for the whole industry. You&#8217;ll also have to bear the marketing costs to educate the world on why they should want this new type of car—that&#8217;s a one-time expense and once it&#8217;s done, other companies will be able to ride on the consumer demand you spent a ton of money building.</p><p>So it&#8217;s not surprising that the last successful startup car company in America was Chrysler in 1925—90 years ago. It&#8217;s basically an impossible endeavor.</p><p>And without any threat from below on the forest floor—from the wild innovation of scrappy entrepreneurs with nothing to lose—the car industry has had the luxury of calmly sunbathing in a tight canopy quilt, making only incremental advances, only when they&#8217;re needed. But there&#8217;s a problem here too—</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) A glitch in the car market separates car company optimization from what&#8217;s best for the world.</strong></span></p><p>As I mentioned above, greed works nicely as an optimization criterion <em>if </em>the market is perfect—open, accurate, and fair.</p><p>Greedy companies will make their decisions based on whatever the best way is to optimize to their environment—i.e. How can we make the most possible money? But a company&#8217;s drive for maximum money is only beneficial to society when the company&#8217;s profit is tightly and accurately correlated with the amount of net positive value its product or service provides to society.</p><p>If I start a lemonade stand, every time I give someone a delicious cup of lemonade, they&#8217;ll be likely to recommend me to their friends and become a recurring customer. I provided positive value and my business&#8217;s success went up with it.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">Value Provided<span style=\"color: #000000;\">.</span></span> </strong>Incentives are aligned.</p><p>If another customer comes to the stand and I give him a cup of lemonade with a fly in it, he won&#8217;t come back and he&#8217;ll tell his friends not to go—I caused harm and my success went down.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">[Value Provided]</span> – <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">[Harm Caused]</span>. </strong>Incentives still aligned.</p><p>But what if I then discover a chemical I can spray on my lemonade that prevents flies from landing on it. The chemical is tasteless, but I know that drinking it regularly will cause customers immense harm a few decades down the road. Customers won&#8217;t experience the harm in the present, so it won&#8217;t affect their opinion of my lemonade or the success of my business.</p><p><strong>Success = <span style=\"color: #339966;\">[Value Provided]</span> – <del><span style=\"color: #808080;\">[Harm Caused]</span></del></strong><b>. </b></p><p>The harm caused is now an <em>unaccounted-for cost</em>, also known as a negative externality, and my incentives are no longer aligned with the customer&#8217;s best interests. If all I care about is greed and maximizing profit, I will continue to use the chemical, because I&#8217;m economically incentivized to do so.</p><p>This kind of negative externality is how tobacco companies got away with murder for so many decades. The long-term cost to customers&#8217; health was unaccounted for because customers were ignorant to the consequences, the negative effects were years away, and there was no regulatory penalty in place to charge for the harm. Thinking purely from a greed-optimizing perspective, cigarette companies acted completely rationally. They kicked up nicotine levels in cigarettes and added shards of glass into filters to create tiny cuts and increase nicotine absorption, which caused further harm but increased demand—but since the harm was unaccounted for, this was a pure net positive for the company. And when anti-tobacco campaigns started to educate customers on cigarette harm—which attaches the harm to the cost of scared customers and lower demand—the tobacco industry hired low-integrity scientists to discredit the negative campaigns and muddle the message. Awareness would get there eventually, but the longer they could delay and keep the harm hidden, the better off they&#8217;d be from a greed standpoint.</p><p>People call this evil, but all it really is is an industry acting in its own best interests within the parameters of its environment. Greed is a simple motivation—it takes whatever it can get, and it&#8217;ll push all available limits it can in order to fully optimize. I used tobacco companies as an example, but you could easily tell the story with fast food, radiation-emitting consumer electronics, politician behavior, the finance industry, and many others.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In the auto industry, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the negative externality.</span> If you have a cheap and easy way to build cars that dump garbage into the atmosphere and no one makes you pay for it, why would you ever change anything?</p><p>It&#8217;s the same story as cigarettes. Instead of the tobacco industry and the cigarette companies who support it, you have the oil industry and the car companies who support it. Instead of short-term emphysema, you have short term city smog. Instead of long-term harm to people&#8217;s health like lung cancer, you have long-term harm to the human way of life like underwater coastal cities.</p><p>A lot of people have written about the hidden cost of carbon emissions, and many of them, on <a href=\"http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">both</a><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/opinion/paul-krugman-conservatives-and-climate-change.html\" target=\"_blank\">sides</a> of the political spectrum, have proposed a logical solution: <strong>a revenue-neutral carbon tax.</strong></p><p>A revenue-neutral carbon tax is revenue-neutral because any increase in government revenue as a result of the tax would be offset by an equal decrease in something else like income taxes. This makes it a politically moot proposal.</p><p>The tax could be applied at any point along the supply chain from oil extraction to the gas pump and the effect would be the same—it would either become more expensive to drive a gas car, less profitable to be in the business of gas, or both. With a carbon tax in place, when you&#8217;re contributing to the carbon problem, you&#8217;re also paying for it—which incentivizes consumers and companies to explore alternatives. This wouldn&#8217;t be the government meddling in the market—it would be the government fixing a glitch in the market.</p><p class=\"p1\">Instead, the government offers tax breaks to people for buying an electric vehicle and subsidies for the renewable energy industry, which is like a town full of businesses who throw their trash in the street, and the government reacting by paying businesses to stop doing that, instead of just charging businesses for doing it. Other times, the government tries to force emissions downwards by forcing car companies to create a minimum number of zero-emissions cars—with limited effect. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton both tried this, to some extent, and both times the next president (Reagan and Bush) removed the regulations upon taking office (ironically, the Clinton mandate for more hybrid cars accomplished nothing in the US, but it scared the shit out of Toyota, who began furiously innovating and created the Prius). Another time, in 1990, the California government tried to institute its own zero-emissions regulations, which the car and oil companies fought until they finally bullied California out of it and the regulations were removed in 2003.<a href=\"#footnote-12-3667\" id=\"note-12-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a> The problem is, giant companies have enough influence that any government attempt at making changes through regulation ends up being watered down to the point where it&#8217;s ineffective.</p><p class=\"p1\">When it comes to a carbon tax, the only explanation for not having one seems to be the power big oil has over the US government—because to me, it seems like every politician in either party should be in favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Right?</p><p>Without any negative consequence of emitting carbon, optimizing for greed pushes certain car technologies forward, like safety, comfort, and drive quality, because getting high safety and quality ratings is tied to demand—but it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> change anything about carbon emissions, because the greed equation doesn&#8217;t currently include that cost.</p><p>So the reason why, 112 years after Ford Motor Company&#8217;s founding, we&#8217;re still using harmful, old-fashioned engines is simple: none of the pressures on the car industry are pushing it to change. The car industry still needs to work hard to optimize in <em>certain</em> areas—that&#8217;s why cars have become safer, smoother, more comfortable, and more efficient over the years. But the most glaring flaw of the modern car—that it constantly dumps garbage into the atmosphere—remains untouched, because doing so is free, because big oil&#8217;s influence means government keeps allowing it, and because there&#8217;s no one from underneath to burst through the canopy and show customers that there&#8217;s a better way.</p><p>It&#8217;s scary. Something really, terribly bad might be happening that could make our actual lives legitimately worse in the future, but we have a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma on our hands—it&#8217;s much, much better for all of us collectively to make a change, but for <em>each individual </em>CEO, lobbyist, or politician, there&#8217;s more to <em>personally </em>gain from maintaining the status quo. People like to say, &#8220;this is the world our children will live in and we&#8217;re botching it for them,&#8221; but for the people with the power to change something, their <em>particular</em> children will be best off if they make the most money possible. The situation is stuck.</p><p>A deeply-set, stagnant industry is like a country led by a deeply-entrenched dynasty—it&#8217;s hard to penetrate the status quo. But even in the case of the most powerful caste systems, sometimes the right person comes along at the right time and starts the right movement, and a revolution can ignite.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part3\"></a>Part 3: The Story of Tesla</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3781\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png\" alt=\"Story of Tesla\" width=\"182\" height=\"182\" /></a></p><p>Christie Nicholson remembers meeting Elon Musk for the first time at a party back in 1989.</p><p>“I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was ‘I think a lot about electric cars,’” Christie said. “And then he turned to me and said, ‘Do you think about electric cars?’”<a href=\"#footnote-13-3667\" id=\"note-13-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a><p>Electric cars seems like an odd thing to spend your time thinking about in 1989. To understand why Musk felt so strongly about them, let&#8217;s start by understanding what electric cars are and how they work.</p><p>There are a handful of common modern types of cars considered greener than traditional gas cars—namely hybrid cars, plug-in hybrid cars, and electric cars (which we&#8217;ll call EVs for &#8220;electric vehicles&#8221;). There&#8217;s also a lot of talk about another type—hydrogen fuel cell cars, which we&#8217;ll just call hydrogen cars. The one thing these cars all have in common is an electric motor.</p><p>There are two types of electric motors—the AC induction motor and the brushless DC electric motor. Since 98% of people reading this aren&#8217;t licking their lips to read a three-paragraph description of the difference, let it suffice to say that they&#8217;re the same basic idea:</p><p>An electric motor is a <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/432632095_8b49ad80ba.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">pig in a blanket</a> where electricity is sent into the outer bread part (called the stator), which is always stationary, and that electric current causes the hot dog part (called the rotor) to rotate. The rotor is attached to the wheel axle which turns the wheels. Like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-29-3667\" id=\"note2-29-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">29</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-3696 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif\" alt=\"indhvtuiction\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /></a></p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><b>How an AC Induction Motor Works Blue Box</b></span></p><p>One of the two common types of electric motor is the AC induction motor (that&#8217;s what Tesla cars use). AC stands for alternating current,<a href=\"#footnote-14-3667\" id=\"note-14-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a> and induction means there&#8217;s no physical contact between the rotor and the stator—electricity in the stator generates a rotating magnetic field which enters the rotor through electrical induction and causes it to spin.</p><p>The stator generates a rotating magnetic field by sending electricity through it in a three phase system:<a href=\"#footnote2-30-3667\" id=\"note2-30-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">30</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3698 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif\" alt=\"inductionmotoranimation\" width=\"513\" height=\"342\" /></a></p><p>So there are three different wires each with an alternating back-and-forth pull—just look at any one color and you&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s just going back and forth. But the three wires&#8217; currents are staggered in just the right way that the point of &#8220;pull&#8221; in the stator rotates in a smooth circle. When the rotor is added in, this rotating magnetic field causes it to spin:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-3697 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif\" alt=\"generatoranimation\" width=\"485\" height=\"323\" /></a></p><p>The idea is that the rotor can never quite catch up to where it wants to be—it&#8217;s always &#8220;chasing&#8221; the rotor&#8217;s field, and that chase is what powers the car. The AC induction motor was invented by Nikola Tesla, and that&#8217;s why Tesla Motors is named after him.<a href=\"#footnote-15-3667\" id=\"note-15-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></div><p>Here are the types of cars that use an electric motor:</p><p><strong>Hybrids </strong>(also called HEVs for hybrid electric vehicles), like the Toyota Prius, have both an electric motor <em>and </em>an internal combustion engine. You don&#8217;t plug a hybrid car in—the gas charges the battery. The battery also gets charge from an electric motor trick called regenerative braking. Normally, all the joules of kinetic energy a car is harnessing when it&#8217;s moving are lost when the car brakes and they&#8217;re just converted into heat. With regenerative braking, electric cars send some of that kinetic energy back into the battery, holding onto those joules to be used again later. The electric component of a hybrid replaces some of the need to burn gas, increasing the miles per gallon, decreasing the car&#8217;s emissions, and saving the driver gas money. Hybrids are a big step up in technology from normal gas cars.</p><p>But they still kind of suck. Why? Because they&#8217;re only kind of helping the emissions problem, not solving it, and they still need to burn gas to work. As I&#8217;ve heard people say, a world 100% full of Prius drivers is still a world 100% addicted to oil.</p><p><strong>Plug-in hybrids </strong>(also called PHEVs) are a better option. Plug-in hybrid cars, like the Chevy Volt, the Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid, and the Ford Fusion Energi, allow you to charge the battery at home and typically drive 10-40 miles just on battery power before the gas kicks in. That&#8217;s often enough to get most people through most of their day, meaning they may rarely need to use gas.</p><p>But if we&#8217;re gonna get <em>so close</em>, why not just go all the way?</p><p><strong>Hydrogen cars </strong>are entirely electric—but they don&#8217;t use a battery. Instead, they fill up with fuel at a station just like a gas car—except they fill up with compressed hydrogen, not gas. The hydrogen mixes with oxygen in the air to produce electricity, which it sends to the motor to power the car. They produce no tailpipe emissions because the only byproduct is clean water. Sounds great, right?</p><p>Musk, for the life of him, cannot understand how anyone could make an argument in favor of hydrogen cars,<a href=\"#footnote-16-3667\" id=\"note-16-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> but it&#8217;s confusing because lots of car companies, like Toyota, Honda, and General Motors, are currently pouring big investments into making hydrogen cars. I wanted to understand the disagreement, so I read like 12 articles in favor and opposed to the technology. At the end of it, I&#8217;m having a hard time seeing why hydrogen cars would have a more promising future than electric vehicles. For those who want details, here&#8217;s a footnote.<a href=\"#footnote-17-3667\" id=\"note-17-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a><p>Finally, there are <strong>electric cars, or</strong><strong>EVs</strong>, like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Ford Focus Electric, and the Tesla Model S.<strong> </strong>These are simple—there&#8217;s a big battery, which you charge, and it powers the electric motor. No liquid involved.</p><p>Now, in <em>theory</em>, EVs make a lot of sense. Forgetting the rest of the car for a second, let&#8217;s look at some of the advantages of the electric motor over the internal combustion gas engine:</p><p><strong>Electric motors are more convenient than gas engines most of the time. </strong>Gas cars have to go to the gas station; EV owners plug their car in every night the same way they charge their phone—no stopping for gas. A gas engine is a lot more complicated than an electric motor, with over 200 parts; an electric motor has fewer than 10. A gas engine requires a transmission, a tailpipe, gears, and a bunch of other grease-covered shit; an EV has none of those things—when you open the hood, it&#8217;s more storage space, like the trunk. Gas engines need oil, which means they need oil changes; EVs don&#8217;t. The extra complexity means gas cars end up needing a lot more maintenance than EVs.</p><p><strong>It costs a lot less to power an electric motor than a gas engine. </strong>The extra costs gas car owners incur for oil changes and car repairs aside, the gas engine&#8217;s fuel—gas—is much more expensive than the electric motor&#8217;s fuel—electricity. Let&#8217;s look at the math:</p><p>The average electric car gets about 3 miles per kWh<a href=\"#footnote-18-3667\" id=\"note-18-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> of electricity, and the US national average electricity rate is 12 cents per kWh. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">That means that driving a mile in an electric car costs about 4 cents. </span></p><p>The cost of driving a gas car is harder, because gas prices and car fuel efficiency widely vary. The best case scenario for a gas car is unusually cheap gas (let&#8217;s say $1.40/gallon) coupled with unusually high fuel efficiency (let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a rare gas car that gets 35 mpg). That would produce the same 4 cents/mile that electric cars get. But very few gas car owners ever pay 4 cents/mile. Without being crazy extreme, for the worse case scenario, let&#8217;s say a high $4.00/gallon gas and a below-average 15 mpg—in that case, a mile in a gas car costs 27 cents per mile. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">At a pretty typical 12,000 miles/year, that means at absolute best, gas is tied with electric for cost, and at worst, it costs over $3,000/year more to drive on gas.</span></p><p><strong>The gas engine is one of the two major causes of the energy/climate crisis. </strong>We&#8217;ve already discussed this—transportation burning oil makes up a third of the world emissions, pollutes cities, and makes nations over-dependent on other nations. The electric motor emits nothing. Yes, it may run on electricity that was produced in a dirty way—but we&#8217;ll get to that later.</p><p>So that&#8217;s why Musk told Christie Nicholson that he thinks a lot about electric cars. The electric motor is clearly the easier, cheaper, and more sensible long-term plan for powering cars.</p><p>But when the electric motor made its first appearance over 100 years ago, there were serious drawbacks that prevented it from becoming the norm—and since electric cars went out of production back then, little time or money has been spent trying to fix those issues. There tend to be three age-old concerns about the viability of the electric car:</p><p><strong>EV Concern 1) Range. </strong>This is really three issues rolled into one:</p><p>A) Will the battery life be too short for long drives, limiting an EV to a car only for local driving?</p><p>B) If I&#8217;m out and about and need to recharge my battery on the road, is there anywhere to do it? Or will I end up stranded?</p><p>C) If I do find a charging station while on the road, will I have to sit there for five hours while it charges?</p><p>These issues are such a prevalent concern among potential EV-owners that they have their own term: range anxiety.</p><p><b>EV Concern 2) Performance. </b>The most common electric vehicle you&#8217;ll see around today is the golf cart. Which doesn&#8217;t excite car owners very much. No one wants a car that drives like shit, and when people think about zooming acceleration, they tend to think about powerful gas engines, not electric motors.</p><p><strong>EV Concern 3) Price. </strong>Ever since the beginning, EVs have cost more than gas cars, mainly because of the high cost of the battery.</p><p>Back in 1910, people cited these exact same three concerns over electric cars, and they&#8217;re part of the reason gas cars won the day. Gas cars had had their own major problems, but Ford had figured out how to make them viable—something no one has yet done for the electric car.</p><p>I asked Musk about his opinion on Henry Ford. He said, &#8220;Ford was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn’t know what they needed.&#8221;</p><p>When he decided in 2003 to stop thinking about electric cars and start making them, the odds weren&#8217;t in Musk&#8217;s favor. There were the high barriers to entry that had prevented any startup car company from succeeding in almost a century; there was the unaccounted for cost of carbon emissions, which made starting an EV company like trying to stand out on a basketball court as a rookie when all the players except you can foul with no penalty; there was the gargantuan oil industry, which would do everything in its power to stomp on any effort to make it obsolete; and on top of that, the EV was a new kind of car whose development had essentially been on pause ever since EV makers threw in the towel a century earlier, and a daunting and costly catch-up process would lay ahead—the three concerns listed above would all need to somehow be addressed for this to have a chance.</p><p>The overarching question was, had electric cars never had their day because of irreconcilable issues? Or had the right person—the Henry Ford of EVs—just not come along yet?</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Car companies aren&#8217;t supposed to start in Silicon Valley, and Silicon Valley startups aren&#8217;t supposed to make cars.</p><p>But the electric car industry is not your grandfather&#8217;s car industry. And in 2003, it wasn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s car industry. After the brief bubble of new electric cars in California in the 1990s between the year the state passed the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate and the year they were bullied into repealing it, the electric car industry had withered into the oblivion of the scattered California garages and tech labs of car geeks. But big things have emerged out of small groups of cutting-edge California geek labs. Apple. Microsoft. Google. So why not the modern electric car industry?</p><p>One of these little car technology companies was AC Propulsion, and while carmakers in Detroit, Tokyo, and Munich continued to not realize that electric cars were clearly the future, the guys at AC Propulsion were experimenting away, quietly making one giant EV breakthrough after another.</p><p>One day last week, I cold called AC Propulsion and accosted their CTO, Paul Carosa, who had been there since the beginning. He was too polite to figure out how to get off the phone with me, so he told me about those years in the late 90s and early 2000s when they created their fanciest car to date—the tzero (pronounced t-zero). AC Propulsion had figured out two huge things:</p><p>First, the tzero was <em>fast—</em>it went 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds, which was crazy fast for an electric car and put it on par with the fast gas cars.</p><p>Second, they had made big progress on an enormous EV shortcoming by getting innovative with the battery. Previous EVs had used lead-acid batteries, which were heavy and limited. AC Propulsion realized that the laptop and mobile phone industry had been pouring development into making small 18650 lithium-ion batteries increasingly efficient, and that those batteries had gotten <em>really</em><em> </em>advanced. 18650 batteries look like AA batteries, which seems like an odd match for a car, but by lining up a few <em>thousand </em>of them in a big battery case, they had just created by <em>far </em>the world&#8217;s best ever car battery. EVs had always been limited to a 60 or 80 or <em>maybe</em> a 120-mile range. The tzero could go 250 miles on a single charge.</p><p>In 2003, a California engineer named JB Straubel was then tinkering around with EVs himself, met Musk to ask for funding for a car project he was working on. Soon after that, Straubel brought Musk by the AC Propulsion office to see the tzero. Musk was blown away. Musk had suspected for a while that EVs were the way of the future, and now that he saw the possibilities with his own eyes, he was convinced.</p><p>At the time, he was already running SpaceX and trying to colonize Mars, so launching a startup car company wasn&#8217;t something he could really fit into his calendar. He really wanted the world to see the tzero because he was sure it would excite people and help to stoke a new wave of EV interest—and he tried to convince the AC Propulsion guys to bring the tzero to market, with his funding, but they didn&#8217;t want to deal with that because it sounded icky. Instead, AC Propulsion introduced Musk to a group of three other entrepreneurs who had also recently approached them with a similar idea and had also been rebuffed. Those three guys, who included Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, had come up with the idea of licensing AC Propulsion&#8217;s technology and bringing it to market themselves as a new company called Tesla Motors<a href=\"#footnote-19-3667\" id=\"note-19-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a>—but to make any of this real, they needed money. It was a perfect match, so they decided to make a run at it together. Musk, who could only dedicate part time to the project, could fund the effort, become Chairman and maintain a strong influence, but by making Eberhard CEO, he could focus on SpaceX with the bulk of his time. And Tesla was on its way.</p><p>The group formed a team and started figuring out how to be a car company. One big problem they had was that this was a new technology, and the R&amp;D costs early on for a new technology drive up the price of the product—that&#8217;s the same reason the very first cell phones and computers started out really expensive. Except in those cases, they were the first of their kind, so the product could be super expensive and still sell. Because perfectly good, affordable gas cars already exist, it wouldn&#8217;t work to come out with the equivalent quality of a $25,000 gas car for $100,000+. So this became the business plan:</p><p><strong>Step 1: High-priced, low-volume car for the super rich.</strong> Come out with the expensive first product, but make the car so fancy that it&#8217;s worth that price—i.e. just make it a legit Ferrari competitor and then it&#8217;s okay to charge over $100,000 for it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Mid-priced, mid-volume car for the pretty rich. </strong>Use the profits from Step 1 to develop the Step 2 car. It would still be expensive, but more like a $75,000 Mercedes or BMW competitor instead of Ferrari.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Low-priced, high-volume car for the masses. </strong>Use the profits from Step 2 to develop a $35,000-ish car that, after the government&#8217;s $7,500 EV tax credit and the savings on gas, would be affordable to the middle class.</p><p>It&#8217;s kind of a Hershey&#8217;s Kiss business plan:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3791\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png\" alt=\"pyramid\" width=\"527\" height=\"397\" /></a></p><p>The overarching mission wasn&#8217;t to build the biggest car company in the world. It was to solve a bunch of long-standing EV shortcomings and build such an insanely great car that it could change everyone&#8217;s perception of what an EV could be and force the world&#8217;s big car companies to have to develop their own line of great EVs. Their end goal, and the company&#8217;s official mission, was &#8220;to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.&#8221; In other words, EVs are gonna happen, but we&#8217;re gonna make them happen a lot <em>sooner</em>. Sooner, in this case, is important, because it means carbon emissions decrease earlier and the long term effects of them are much less damaging.</p><p>So they got working. And four years later, they had their Step 1 car, the<strong> Roadster:</strong><a href=\"#footnote2-31-3667\" id=\"note2-31-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">31</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3739 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla1\" width=\"506\" height=\"337\" /></a></p><p>With the Roadster, Tesla wasn&#8217;t trying to make their long term car (one Tesla employee told me that from the beginning, Musk would make sure everyone knew that the company&#8217;s long-term mission &#8220;was <em>not</em> to make toys for rich people.&#8221;) They just wanted to build something awesome to A) show the world how great an EV could be, and B) generate revenue to develop their Step 2 car. So they didn&#8217;t start from scratch on the body design, instead basing it on a Lotus Elise.</p><p>The Roadster didn&#8217;t change the world—no $110,000 car ever could—but it sent a message to the industry that Tesla was for real. You may not have heard of the Roadster when it was announced in 2006 or when it started shipping in 2008, but some of the major car companies took notice—Nissan soon launched the all-electric Leaf and GM launched the plug-in electric Chevy Volt soon after the Roadster&#8217;s appearance (Bob Lutz, who was Chairman of GM at the time, openly credits Tesla for their decision to make the Volt, saying that after the Roadster unveiling, he went to the GM board and asked, &#8220;If a little company in California can do this, why can’t we?”).</p><p>But there were some pretty big problems with the first product. Finishing the car was taking way longer than planned, the cost of making each Roadster was way higher than planned, and the early shipments often had defects. This made Musk sad, so he and the board fired Eberhard as CEO, which made Eberhard sad.<a href=\"#footnote-20-3667\" id=\"note-20-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a> Just as this was going down, the most inconvenient thing ever happened—the 2008 recession—which made the entire car industry sad, but especially Tesla, who didn&#8217;t yet have brand recognition and wasn&#8217;t yet profitable because of all the upfront investment they had been pouring in. A crippling recession is never helpful, but it was <em>really, really </em>bad timing for Tesla.</p><p>Musk had hired a second CEO, but a year in, in late 2008, the company was in one of those movie scenes where the person&#8217;s been badly wounded and clearly about to die and there&#8217;s this dramatic dialogue scene and the dying person is saying some last words and every time they pause for a second the audience is like, &#8220;Is that it? Are they dead? Oh no they just talked again I guess there&#8217;s one more line.&#8221; Musk, who wasn&#8217;t enjoying the drama of the scene, finally was like, &#8220;PAUSE THE MOVIE QUICKLY PAUSE IT PAUSE IT&#8221; and took over as CEO,<a href=\"#footnote-21-3667\" id=\"note-21-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a>going into full adrenaline mode to try to keep the company alive. And as mentioned in the last post, SpaceX was in the same movie at the same time playing the same role, so Musk&#8217;s life was like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3772\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png\" alt=\"S-T\" width=\"550\" height=\"342\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But enough people had been impressed enough by Tesla that a couple key investments at critical moments came in and kept the company alive, and at the end of the whole mess, Tesla was now a new company. Musk was CEO, and the Jonathan Ive of the car industry, star car designer Franz von Holzhausen, who had been the Design Director at GM and then Mazda, had decided to bet his career on the barely-standing Tesla and became their chief designer.</p><p>A few weeks ago, when I stepped into the Tesla design studio to meet von Holzhausen, I was excited to meet the uber-flamboyant diva celebrity car designer, just hoping I would understand what he was saying through his unbelievably thick German accent—and was horribly disappointed to meet an extremely normal-acting American man.</p><p>The studio, which I described in the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">last post</a>, is a shiny playroom of art and physics. Von Holzhausen showed me a full-size clay car that was simultaneously testing two different possible designs for the upcoming Model 3 by making the two halves of the model different. He explained how precise everything about car design is and how &#8220;a difference of a quarter millimeter can spread itself across the entire car.&#8221;</p><p>I asked him what it was like to come to Tesla after having spent years at more established car companies. He described the difference like this: &#8220;A company like GM is a finance-driven company who always has to live up to financial expectations. Here we look at it the other way around—the product is successful when it’s great, and the company becomes great because of that.&#8221; (This mirrored what Musk had told me earlier in the day: &#8220;The moment the person leading a company thinks numbers have value in themselves, the company&#8217;s done. The moment the CFO becomes CEO—it&#8217;s done. Game over.&#8221;) Von Holzhausen went on, saying, &#8220;Another difference is that at other companies, engineering comes first—a design package is prescribed on the designer and they’re told to make it beautiful. At Tesla, design and engineering are assigned equal value, and Elon keeps them opposed to each other.&#8221; Now that von Holzhausen has gotten used to his freedom to be obsessed with the product at Tesla, he says he &#8220;would dread to go back to pre-historic ways.”</p><p>Von Holzhausen&#8217;s first mission at Tesla was to design their Step 2 car—the mid-priced, mid-volume one—that would be called the<strong> Model S</strong>. The Roadster was based on existing design and was a springboard for the company more than a long-term product. The Model S would be Tesla&#8217;s first flagship product, and it was their chance to reinvent the concept of a car, from scratch. Von Holzhausen said, &#8220;When we started Model S, it was a clean sheet of paper.&#8221;</p><p>This all sounded uncannily similar to how Steve Jobs had done things at Apple. He obsessed over making &#8220;insanely great products,&#8221; and he never paid attention to what other companies were doing, always coming at things from a clean sheet of paper perspective. When Apple decided to make a phone, they didn&#8217;t try to make a better Blackberry—they asked, &#8220;What should a mobile phone be?&#8221;</p><p>Over time, big industries tend to get flabby and uncreative and risk-averse—and if the right outsider company has the means and creativity to come at the industry with a fresh perspective and rethink the whole thing, there&#8217;s often a huge opportunity there.</p><p>When the iPhone came out, it turned the phone industry on its head. So should we be surprised that when the Tesla Model S came out, Consumer Reports <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/04/consumer-reports-10-top-picks-of-2015/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anointed it</a> the best car that had ever been made with an unheard of 99/100 rating, and that Tesla owners are <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/In-Gear/2014/1205/Tesla-Model-S-leads-the-pack-in-customer-satisfaction.-Again.\" target=\"_blank\">across-the-board</a> obsessed with the car? No, because it&#8217;s like the iPhone—it&#8217;s a 15-year leap into the future.<a href=\"#footnote2-32-3667\" id=\"note2-32-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3830\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg\" alt=\"6667\" width=\"600\" height=\"367\" /></a></p><p>The Model S is the fastest 4-door sedan in history, with 3.2-second 0-60 time. It saves battery power by being insanely aerodynamic with the industry&#8217;s lowest drag coefficient (.24). A bunch of engineering innovations have combined to give it the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/tesla-model-s-highest-safety-rating/\" target=\"_blank\">highest NHTSA safety rating</a> of any car ever tested by the US government, 5.4 stars.</p><p>The Model S is already <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=EJmhpgW0Dmc\" target=\"_blank\">driving itself</a> and soon, it&#8217;ll be able to drive itself to meet you out in the driveway in the morning with the temperature already set and the right music on; at night, you&#8217;ll be able to pull up to the house and just get out of the car and the car will park itself into the garage and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2894345/Tesla-teases-electric-car-plugs-charge-Elon-Musk-describes-metal-snake-automatically-connects-vehicles.html\" target=\"_blank\">plug itself in</a>. They did away with model years (i.e. the 2014 Toyota Camry, the 2015 Toyota Camry, etc.), so instead of holding all the year&#8217;s new features until the new release, they just put features in as they go. Someone who buys a Tesla today might have a slightly different car than someone who bought one two weeks ago. And they&#8217;re constantly rolling out fixes and new features through automatic wifi software updates—owners often wake up in the morning to discover the car has a new capability.</p><p>In a bunch of cases, Tesla has wanted to do something that wasn&#8217;t technically possible with the current world or industry limitations—so they&#8217;d build what they needed to build to change those limitations:</p><p>The Tesla battery is heavy and they wanted to make the body super light to offset some of that weight—so they turned to SpaceX and used its advanced rocket technology to make Tesla the only North American car with an all aluminum body.</p><p>Musk and von Holzhausen&#8217;s<a href=\"#footnote-22-3667\" id=\"note-22-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a> team had spent all this time perfecting the design of the car before it was time to put the door handles on, and they got really used to it that way. When it was time for handles, they didn&#8217;t want to ruin how it was, so they figured out how to make the handles lay <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIU73kK7ZUk\" target=\"_blank\">flush</a> with the door.</p><p>They didn&#8217;t like the dealership model and wanted to sell directly to customers, but many states don&#8217;t allow that, so one by one, they&#8217;re <a href=\"http://my.teslamotors.com/fr_CH/forum/forums/where-can-tesla-sell-cars\" target=\"_blank\">fighting</a> the states that won&#8217;t and slowly overturning direct car sales bans.</p><p>They wanted to get rid of buttons altogether and have all controls on a huge, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVsHEZivqm8\" target=\"_blank\">17&#8243; touchscreen</a>—but when their first car came out, there was no iPad yet, and 17&#8243; touchscreens suitable for a car didn&#8217;t exist. So they built their own.<a href=\"#footnote2-33-3667\" id=\"note2-33-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">33</a><p>Innovations like these helped make the Tesla a standout car, but there were still questions around the major shortcomings of EV cars. Of the three EV concerns we listed earlier, AC Propulsion had made significant headway on two—performance and battery range—and the Tesla team had picked it up from there and had continued to improve both. Performance was now the best in the world for a sedan and the battery range—between 208 and 270 miles per charge, depending on the model—was excellent.</p><p>But there were still two problematic questions that needed to be addressed:</p><p>Can you take a road trip? And can anyone afford the car? Tesla is working on both.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How Tesla is solving the road trip problem:</strong></span></p><p>With a 200+ range, the Tesla battery has plenty of juice to get most people through the day on any normal day. Even a busy day of commuting and errands and exploration rarely gets close to 200 miles driving. But on long city-to-city drives or road trips, EVs have always had an issue. So Musk came up with a solution:</p><p>Build a worldwide energy network. Tesla came up with the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/tesla-motors-supercharger-event\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharger</a>—a high-caliber, on-the-road charger—and there would be public stations that would contain a whole row of Superchargers, just like a row of gas pumps at a gas station. A normal garage charger takes either 5 or 10 hours to fully charge the Model S battery, depending on which type of in-car charging system you opted for. Clearly no one wants to stop for multiple hours while on the road to accomplish what a gas car can by stopping for five minutes—so the Supercharger goes much faster. It can charge a Model S at a rate that gives it about 60 miles of range for every 10 minutes of charging time. So if you&#8217;re driving between Boston and New York (215 miles), you might make it with no stopping, but if you did need to stop, you could just charge up for 5 or 10 minutes—not that much more than a stop for gas. Driving from LA to San Francisco (382 miles), you&#8217;d need to stop for 20 or 30 minutes.</p><p>And the thing is—on a 4-hour drive from Boston to New York, isn&#8217;t a 5-10 minute stop desirable anyway? On a 6-7 hour drive from LA to SF, wouldn&#8217;t most people stop for 20-30 minutes to get some food and go to the bathroom anyway?</p><p>The more I thought about this, the more I realized how little of an issue range is for an EV with a good battery like the Tesla. Just say you do a long drive five days a year. That means on 360 of the 365 days, you have to do nothing. You just drive, and <em>you never need to stop at a gas station.</em> And the other five days? You&#8217;d probably just need to stop for about as long as you would stop on a long drive anyway.</p><p>Seems like a perfect solution, but you need to have a Supercharger along <em>your </em>drive if it&#8217;s going to work. Here&#8217;s where Superchargers are today in the US:<a href=\"#footnote2-34-3667\" id=\"note2-34-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">34</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3742\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg\" alt=\"Supercharger US 14\" width=\"600\" height=\"286\" /></a></p><p>And they&#8217;re building them at a furious pace—here&#8217;s where they&#8217;ll be by the end of 2016:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3820\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"Supercharger-US-16-compressor\" width=\"600\" height=\"284\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Europe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Europe</a> and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Asia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Asia</a> will be equally well-covered.</p><p>For now, only Teslas can use the Supercharger stations, and only the Tesla can really make long-distance drives right now anyway. But down the road, Musk plans to partner with other EV car companies so any EV can stop at one.</p><p>A couple other things about Superchargers: they&#8217;re all free to use, and soon, they&#8217;ll all be entirely solar-powered. Musk jokes that if there&#8217;s a zombie apocalypse, Tesla owners will be fine because they won&#8217;t need the grid to fuel their car. And it means that if you had friends to stay with, you could technically drive across the US without taking a wallet.</p><p>This is also going to become even easier with time, because Tesla is making new innovations every year. For example, the Roadster now has a 350 mile range battery and you can just about do LA to SF without stopping—it&#8217;s only a matter of time before their cheaper cars have a similar range. Tesla also recently <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/battery-swap-event\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled</a> a new Supercharger feature—<strong>the battery swap</strong>. A Tesla driver will be able to pull up to a little rectangle and stop the car. The ground opens up and a machine comes out and takes the car&#8217;s battery off, brings up a fresh battery and puts it on, and you&#8217;re good to go—<em>all in 90 seconds</em>. This would cost $60-80, or as much as an expensive tank of gas—so Tesla drivers would now have the option of &#8220;fast or free.&#8221;</p><p>So with that problem very close to being out of the way, Tesla seems to only have one issue left:</p><p><em>Who the hell can afford a $75,000 car? </em></p><p>The starting price of a Tesla Model S is technically $69,900. But if you want the higher-range cars and the faster charging battery, the price jumps up. There are a bunch of other &#8220;well shit now that you mention it yeah I do want that too&#8221; features, and a Model S can quickly work its way toward the $100,000 mark.</p><p>Musk is always quick to point out that for the moment, the US offers a $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV of sufficient range. He also points out what I mentioned above about the $2,000-ish a year gas savings. Sure—but even subtracting all that, we&#8217;re around $55,000 for a Tesla Model S, which is prohibitive for most people. Tesla has a new car coming out soon—their SUV with <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx\" target=\"_blank\">Falcon Wing doors</a>, called the Model X—but it&#8217;s another Step 2, mid-price / mid-volume expensive car. Doesn&#8217;t solve the pricing problem.</p><p>It&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089555_electric-car-market-share-in-2013-understanding-the-numbers-better\" target=\"_blank\">rule of thumb</a> in the car world that every $5,000 decrease in car price approximately doubles the number of buyers who can afford the car. So if Tesla can somehow come out with a stellar EV for about $35,000 less than the Model S, it would double the buyer pool 7 times, or multiply it by 125-fold. Which would now mean <em>most</em> people could afford it. Let&#8217;s bring back Tesla&#8217;s Hershey&#8217;s Kiss business plan from earlier:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3792\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png\" alt=\"pyramid2\" width=\"550\" height=\"414\" /></a></p><p>So Step 3 is what this is all about. Step 3 is why Tesla exists and if Tesla ends up changing the world, it&#8217;ll be because of Step 3.</p><p>That car is the Model 3, and it&#8217;s coming out in 2017. Supposedly. And it&#8217;ll cost $35,000—$27,500 after the tax credit, and after taking gas savings into account, under $20,000. Supposedly.</p><p>But <em>how? </em>Right now, the Model 3 battery costs around $20,000. Even if Tesla ditches the high-tech aluminum body, makes the car smaller, and ditches some of the fanciest things about the Model S, the battery pack alone makes a price like $35,000 impossible.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>How Tesla is solving the high-price problem:</strong></span></p><p>Big problems call for big solutions. To solve the range problem, Tesla is building a worldwide energy network of Superchargers. And to solve the price problem, they&#8217;re building this:<a href=\"#footnote2-35-3667\" id=\"note2-35-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">35</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3821\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"hero-compressor\" width=\"800\" height=\"375\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s what Musk has named the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/gigafactory\" target=\"_blank\">Gigafactory</a>. It&#8217;s a $5 billion lithium-ion battery factory, currently being built in Nevada. The factory will be self-sufficient, powered entirely by on-site solar, wind, and geothermal energy, and it will employ 6,500 people.</p><p>Right now, the world&#8217;s combined annual output of lithium-ion batteries is 30GWh—mostly for use in laptops and mobile phones. The Gigafactory will make more than that each year, which means it will <em>more than double the total lithium-ion batteries made each year globally</em>. There are two huge benefits to doing this:</p><p>First, Tesla is planning to ramp up production of their cars until they&#8217;re producing 500,000 of them a year, and they&#8217;re going to need a lot of lithium-ion batteries when they do. Musk&#8217;s reasoning is simple: “I know we can’t get enough lithium-ion batteries unless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is building this thing.” The numbers make this necessity clear. To  make enough batteries for their planned 500,000 cars a year, Tesla will need about 30GWh of lithium-ion batteries a year—the current world output—meaning that without building the Gigafactory, they&#8217;d have to use every single lithium-ion battery in the world. Tesla&#8217;s Gigafactory will just barely cover Tesla&#8217;s needs—if a day comes when every car company is making a ton of EVs, there will need to be many Gigafactories built by many companies.</p><p>Second, by both doubling the world supply of lithium-ion batteries and by continuing to innovate with battery technology, Tesla&#8217;s work at the Gigafactory will make batteries a lot cheaper. Musk says the price of the battery should go down by <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/05/14/the-logic-of-teslas-gigafactory-the-economics-are-a-no-brainer/\" target=\"_blank\">at least 30%</a>. Right now, Musk says Tesla could make their cars with a <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/26/elon-musk-says-500-mile-ev-happen-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">500 mile range</a>—they don&#8217;t do it because it would increase the cost of the car. But as battery prices go down, EV ranges will go up as well.</p><p>I&#8217;m pretty convinced that the Model S is the best expensive car ever made. In its first year, its sales blew away its well-known direct competitors—the S-Class Mercedes, BMW 7-Series, the Lexus LS, and the Audi A8—and it&#8217;s been in the lead ever since. But those cars all play in a small space for the very rich.</p><p>It&#8217;s the Model 3 that will turn the industry on its head. You may not know much about Tesla today—or particularly care—but I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone will know about the Model 3 soon. Maybe that&#8217;s why Musk refuses to do any advertising—because he knows that when the Model 3 comes out, he won&#8217;t have to.</p><p>The market has taken notice. Tesla&#8217;s $226 million IPO in June of 2010 marks the first IPO for an American car company since Ford went public in 1956. Since then, the company&#8217;s value has soared upwards. Today, seven years after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Tesla&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:TSLA\" target=\"_blank\">market cap</a> is a massive $31 billion. To put in perspective how big a deal that is, I set Tesla&#8217;s path to that number down on a graph with the Big Three US automakers (just using straight lines to simplify):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3829\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg\" alt=\"Car Graphs\" width=\"638\" height=\"399\" /></a></p><p>The car industry forest canopy has been pretty stagnant for a long time, and for decades, no hungry underdog has been able to make a run at it. Tesla hasn&#8217;t cracked the canopy yet, but for the first time in a long time, there&#8217;s a new company bolting upwards from the ground at lightning speed.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>A Ripple Effect</strong></span></p><p>If you&#8217;re another one of the big car companies, and you&#8217;ve been around for decades, and you&#8217;re comfortably doing your thing, making slight incremental improvements each year to your existing line of cars—could <em>anything in the world</em> be more annoying than Tesla?</p><p>Remember, the car companies know alllll about electric cars and their benefits. Most of them made an electric car in the 1990s when California mandated that they do, and then the second the mandate went away, they confiscated and literally <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F\" target=\"_blank\">crushed</a> the cars. Then they whipped the cars into the dump and covered the pile with a tablecloth with a &#8220;nothing to see here folks&#8221; look on their faces. The scare was over and they could go back to their comfort zone, incrementally improving their gas vehicles.</p><p>Their feelings on EVs make perfect sense:</p><p>Dealerships make a huge amount of profit fixing gas engines, oil filters, and doing oil changes—money they&#8217;d stop making when they sold EVs with motors that rarely broke.</p><p>The car companies already know gas cars back and forth, and they&#8217;ve mastered the art of making a few tiny new changes to them each year so the new year&#8217;s models will be a little better than the previous year&#8217;s. But EVs are a new world for them, and they don&#8217;t know any more about how to make a good powertrain or improve battery energy density than Tesla does—in fact, they know less, as evidenced by Toyota and Mercedes both buying the Tesla powertrain for their EVs. What a pain in the ass all that R&amp;D would be.</p><p>Most importantly, the world already wants to buy gas cars. There&#8217;s no convincing needed—just a few standard TV ads to hone the latest phase of the brand&#8217;s image and inform customers about the latest product updates. But EVs are new and scary to customers, and there&#8217;s a hump to get over in educating the world about why they should buy one. But the <em>really </em>problematic thing about this is that in order to market an EV well, you need to do what I&#8217;m doing in this post and explain all the reasons EVs are obviously a huge step forward from gas cars—which simultaneously sends the message, &#8220;Gas cars are dirty, inconvenient, and old-fashioned.&#8221; Not a thing you want to do when your current bread and butter is selling 10 million gas cars a year.</p><p>And who wants to deal with all of these things when they could just skip it <i>if Tesla would just go away.</i></p><p>Franz von Holzhausen has worked at three of these other companies. The way he sees it, &#8220;they’re trapped in their manufacturing legacy process, trapped in gas engines being their bread and butter, trapped in their dealership model, trapped in their own history.&#8221;</p><p>Musk explains it as a lack of guts and originality: “The big car companies are so derivative. They want to see it work somewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward.”<a href=\"#footnote2-36-3667\" id=\"note2-36-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">36</a><p>But the Tesla tree is racing upwards, and its impending burst through the canopy has successfully scared the industry. We know this for sure, because when the first Tesla Roadster shipped in 2008, there were <em>no </em>big company EVs on the market. Today, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Mitsubishi, and Smart <em>all </em><a href=\"http://www.plugincars.com/cars\" target=\"_blank\">have an EV</a> on the road. Not a coincidence.</p><p>So what&#8217;s the deal with all of these other EVs?</p><p>Most notable is the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/nissan-leaf\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan Leaf</a>, introduced in 2010, which has been the highest-selling EV in the world in recent years (though the much more expensive Tesla Model S has topped the industry in EVs sold <a href=\"http://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/\" target=\"_blank\">so far in 2015</a>). The Leaf costs about $30,000 ($22,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 84 miles. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has for a while been one of the few strongly pro-EV voices in the car industry outside of Tesla. He <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1095851_electric-cars-win-for-4-reasons-says-nissans-carlos-ghosn\" target=\"_blank\">talks about</a> the &#8220;cul-de-sac&#8221; effect that will begin to accelerate EV sales—i.e. people will be jealous that their neighbor has a more futuristic car and doesn&#8217;t have to get gas, will ask questions, and then might get one themselves.</p><p>The recently introduced <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/bmw-i3.html\" target=\"_blank\">BMW i3</a> is currently selling next best after the Leaf and Model S. It costs $43,000 ($35,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 81 miles. BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer has jumped on the EV train, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578635543525172364\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a>, &#8220;You have to look into the future, 10, 15, 20 years…cars like the BMW i3 are a must.&#8221;</p><p>No other EV has had significant sales yet.<a href=\"#footnote-23-3667\" id=\"note-23-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a> I asked Musk about the Leaf and the i3. About the Leaf, he said, &#8220;The range is too low, but if they keep iterating on that, they’ll eventually get there.&#8221; On the i3: &#8220;They&#8217;re trying to do something there. The range is low, but it&#8217;s a step in the right direction, and if they keep going, they’ll get something there.&#8221;</p><p>This &#8220;Congrats on your first big boy toilet poop, Johnny, now next time try to get the whole thing inside the bowl and you&#8217;ll be on your way!&#8221; tone is about as effusive as Musk gets when assessing the industry&#8217;s current attempts at an EV.</p><p>Volkswagen just hired BMW&#8217;s ex-CEO and also <a href=\"http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/\" target=\"_blank\">seems to be</a> bullish on EVs, and GM is promising big things with their upcoming EV, the Chevy Bolt.</p><p>Other car companies still aren&#8217;t convinced. Mercedes CEO Dieter Zetsche <a href=\"http://ecomento.com/2015/04/02/mercedes-ceo-dieter-zetsche-looks-at-the-electric-car-future/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he doesn&#8217;t expect EVs to sell well for a while, because &#8220;the customer gets a car with less range, longer refueling times, somewhat less space, and a higher price tag.&#8221; The major Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, are both skeptical about EVs and have been pouring their future into hybrids and hydrogen cars instead. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne is so anti-EV that he&#8217;s told the world <em>not </em>to buy their Fiat 500e EV, saying they&#8217;re only selling it because regulations have forced them to.</p><p>If EVs are the dominant car of the future, they have a long way to go to get there. As of January 2015, there were a total of <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/28/ev-demand-growing-global-market-hits-740000-units/\" target=\"_blank\">740,000</a> EVs on the road worldwide. Compare that to the whole picture of over 80 million cars sold worldwide annually and over a billion total cars on the road. EVs make up only a fraction of a percent of the car industry. But they&#8217;re on the move:<a href=\"#footnote2-37-3667\" id=\"note2-37-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">37</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3710 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png\" alt=\"ev-fleet-count\" width=\"532\" height=\"352\" /></a></p><p>So we&#8217;re either at the cusp of a new EV-dominated car era or in the middle of another little EV bubble before they vanish from existence <em>again</em>—and as you can see from the quotes above, the car industry is currently divided in which way they&#8217;re betting.</p><p>I think we&#8217;ll learn a lot more soon, because the world is still yet to see its first true potential EV disruptor. The issue with Tesla right now is most people can&#8217;t afford one, and the issue with <em>every </em>other EV is the range sucks. It looks like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3775\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png\" alt=\"Plot\" width=\"500\" height=\"471\" /></a></p><p>The truth is, the typical American drives <a href=\"http://www.facethefactsusa.org/facts/the-asphalts-getting-crowded-video-\" target=\"_blank\">37 miles a day</a> on average, and the 80+ mile range options are probably actually plenty for most people. But 80 miles seems like an insufficient range to prospective buyers, and mass adoption won&#8217;t happen with that kind of range.</p><p>Tesla&#8217;s plan all along was to plant a stellar car right in that Quadrant 4 box, and that&#8217;s what they say they&#8217;re going to do in 2017 when the Model 3 comes out. A number of other carmakers, including <a href=\"http://www.leftlanenews.com/nissan-leaf-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan</a>, <a href=\"http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/\" target=\"_blank\">Volkswagen</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/01/14/what-mary-barras-growth-strategy-says-about-the-new-gm/\" target=\"_blank\">GM</a> have all declared their intention to release a not-that-expensive long-range EV soon. It&#8217;s not clear if any or all of these companies will get into Quadrant 4, but if they do&#8230;</p><p>If there are high-quality, affordable EVs for sale that also have a high range&#8230;</p><p><strong>I cannot think of <em>one </em>reason <em>anyone </em>would <em>ever </em>buy a gas car again.</strong></p><p>A Tesla-quality car that&#8217;s affordable to the middle class would seem to have only pros in the Pro/Con list:</p><p><strong>Pros of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Drives better. </strong>The instant torque of an EV is like exploding out of a gun. There&#8217;s no lag time between your foot touching the pedal and the car moving. Without gears, it accelerates perfectly smoothly. The handling is incredible. It&#8217;s silent.</li><li><strong>More convenient. </strong>No stops for gas. Much less need to take the car in for maintenance. No oil changes. More storage because with no engine, the hood is now the frunk (the front trunk).</li><li><strong>Safer. </strong>With no engine, the entire front of the car becomes a crumple zone. That&#8217;s part of why the Model S has blown away the safety ratings.</li><li><strong>Cheaper. </strong>No gas or oil, and less maintenance. No longer beholden to fluctuating gas prices.</li><li><strong>Healthier. </strong>No smog in cities, which cause <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/dangers-smog-what-you-need-know-about-air-pollution#2\" target=\"_blank\">many, many health problems.</a></li><li><strong>Oh yeah, and the whole thing about avoiding an environmental, economic, or geopolitical catastrophe.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Cons of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p><ul><li>People who love to shift the manual stick around with all their muscle because they&#8217;re a cool cat on the open road to destiny can&#8217;t do that.</li><li>Five days a year, when you&#8217;re on a long drive, you have to stop for 30 minutes every three hours instead of five minutes every four hours—a con that becomes moot if you would have stopped for 30 minutes anyway every few hours.</li></ul><p>EVs aren&#8217;t there yet. Right now, there are legit cons. But as the next few years pass, EVs will get cheaper, battery ranges will get longer and longer, Superchargers will pop up more and more until they&#8217;re everywhere, and charging times will just decrease as technology advances. Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, and I&#8217;m sure a bunch of seething commenters will try to make that very clear to me, but it seems like a given to me: the gas era is over and EVs are the obvious, <em>obvious </em>future.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>An Angry Giant</strong></span></p><p>The car companies, as I mentioned, aren&#8217;t happy about all of this—they&#8217;re acting like a kid with a cupcake whose parents are forcing them to eat their vegetables.</p><p>But how about the oil industry?</p><p>Unlike car companies, the oil industry can&#8217;t suck it up, get on the EV train, and after an unpleasant hump, continue to thrive. If EVs catch on in a serious way and end up being the ubiquitous type of car, oil companies are ruined. 45% of all the world&#8217;s extracted oil is used for transportation, but in the developed world, it&#8217;s much higher—in the US, 71% of extracted oil is used for transportation, and most of that is for cars.</p><p>So if the car industry has a cupcake and its parents are forcing it to eat vegetables, the oil industry has a cupcake but <i>its </i>parents are forcing it to eat <em>razor blades.</em> The car industry will resist the veggies and have a little tantrum before grudgingly giving in—the oil industry will <em>furiously try to gouge the parents&#8217; eyes out in resistance </em>because for him, this is life and death.</p><p>And that&#8217;s how the oil industry sees EVs—horrifying razor blades. And giant industries don&#8217;t just roll over and eat razor blades without a serious fight.</p><p>We&#8217;ve seen this before. Tobacco companies fought tooth and nail to stay alive and strong as long as possible when the tide started to turn against them. And the oil industry itself has been fighting tooth and nail for a while now on another front—the battle to keep people confused about whether global warming is a thing.</p><p>Usually in these cases, the industry clawing for survival knows it&#8217;s on the way out. But in the meantime, they&#8217;re making money, and the longer it takes before the public fully gets the situation, the longer it&#8217;ll be before the public uniformly rejects them, politicians are able to regulate against them, and the money finally stops. Time is very much money in these situations.</p><p>The tactic to stay alive longer is always the same—put out misinformation to create confusion, and make it political so half the country feels like they&#8217;re going against &#8220;their own team&#8221; if they side against the industry.</p><p>The super-clever way they create confusion is by generating the public perception that there&#8217;s a genuine debate among scientists. That&#8217;s how you make a 97% consensus seem like an open question:<a href=\"#footnote2-38-3667\" id=\"note2-38-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">38</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3708\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg\" alt=\"consensus_gap\" width=\"563\" height=\"422\" /></a></p><p>The same tactic was used a few decades ago when 98% of scientists said smoking caused lung cancer, but the tobacco industry convinced the public for a long time that &#8220;scientists disagree&#8221; about whether smoking is harmful. The book <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> details how many of the same pro-smoking &#8220;scientists&#8221; a generation later became the &#8220;global warming isn&#8217;t a thing&#8221; scientists—the actual same <em>people.</em></p><p>When the 1990 California Zero Emissions Mandate forced car companies to make an EV in order to continue selling cars in CA, the oil industry saw it as a small tumor they needed to swiftly nip in the bud before it grew into a serious threat. Soon, a new voice popped up, a grassroots campaign called &#8220;Californians Against Utility Company Abuse&#8221; (CAUCA). The campaign staged protests against the state&#8217;s proposed utility investments in alternative-vehicle support systems. They also mentioned that &#8220;the environmental benefits of electric cars were dubious.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-39-3667\" id=\"note2-39-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">39</a> But as it turns out, CAUCA was created by a PR firm who was hired and funded by the oil industry. Eventually, the mandate was repealed, EVs disappeared, and the tumor was squashed.</p><p>Now, there&#8217;s a new tumor for the oil industry—Elon Musk. Tesla is showing the public directly that EVs are the future and funding the development of technology that&#8217;s making EVs better than anyone thought possible. A government mandate is crushable—obsessed Model S owners are not.</p><p>But again, oil doesn&#8217;t need to avoid an EV future to have a reason to fight—it just needs to <em>delay </em>the EV future for <em>as long as it possibly can. </em>Tesla&#8217;s mission is &#8220;to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.&#8221; Big oil&#8217;s current mission is &#8220;to <em>delay </em>the advent of sustainable transport by making people think EVs aren&#8217;t actually better for the environment than gas cars.&#8221;</p><p>EVs are most definitely better for the environment—so the oil industry reaches for a key tool.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3832\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png\" alt=\"BS 2\" width=\"450\" height=\"322\" /></a></p><p>There are now a bunch of myths floating around. I didn&#8217;t treat them like automatic myths—each time I heard an argument for why EVs are dirty, I dug in and read about it, but each time, there was little basis in fact. Some examples of myths I&#8217;ve seen floating around about EVs or Tesla in particular:</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>EV battery disposal is <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/01/09/electric-car-subsidies-transferring-wealth-from-poor-to-rich/\" target=\"_blank\">hazardous</a>.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>A) Lithium-ion cells used in cars aren&#8217;t especially hazardous and are classified as landfill safe, B) They&#8217;re almost all recycled anyway, and C) They&#8217;ll continue to be recycled, because a used car battery still has a lot of value, either as a stationary battery or in the raw materials themselves.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>Manufacturing a Tesla is much dirtier than manufacturing a Prius or many other gas cars.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>Expensive cars are dirtier to manufacture than cheap ones. Comparing the manufacturing of a Tesla to a Prius is like saying &#8220;Prius&#8217;s are dirty because it&#8217;s dirtier to manufacture a Prius than a golf cart.&#8221; If you compare apples to apples, it&#8217;s no dirtier to make a Tesla than a similarly-priced luxury car.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>EVs are a huge burden on the electric grid.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>The grid is sized for the worst second of the worst day of the worst year—so there&#8217;s usually a lot of excess capacity. You could replace 70% of US gas car miles with EV miles with no changes to the grid. That percentage will also grow even higher as more homes get their power from solar panels.</p><p><strong>Myth: </strong>The Tesla uses a lot of graphite in their battery, which <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-14/teslas-in-california-help-bring-dirty-rain-to-china\" target=\"_blank\">contributes</a> to China&#8217;s pollution problem.</p><p><strong>Actually: </strong>The logic here is: &#8220;Tesla batteries use graphite; the world&#8217;s biggest source of graphite is in China; China has terrible pollution; therefore, Tesla is partially responsible for China&#8217;s pollution.&#8221; Except when I did some digging, I learned that Tesla uses synthetic graphite made mostly in Japan and Poland, and that the average Model S uses 100kg of it. That 100kg lasts for ten years, so the amount of graphite used to make a Model S is similar to the amount you&#8217;d use if you had a few barbecues a year.</p><p>But there&#8217;s one myth which has been more effective and more pervasive than any of these—<strong>the long tailpipe theory.</strong></p><p>The long tailpipe theory is everywhere. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t like EVs points it out immediately. So what&#8217;s the theory? I&#8217;ll let Fox News&#8217; Greg Gutfeld do the honors:</p><p>&#8220;The entire reason for doing these stupid little cars is a lie because electricity comes from coal. In some cases, some studies show that these can produce more pollution than internal combustion engines.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-40-3667\" id=\"note2-40-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">40</a><p>Upon first examination, this makes sense. Let&#8217;s bring back our US emissions chart to see what Greg means:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3768\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png\" alt=\"US Emissions 2013 2\" width=\"900\" height=\"515\" /></a></p><p>Earlier in the post, we identified the two biggest causes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: cars running on gas and coal making electricity. The long tailpipe theory&#8217;s logic is that all an EV does is shift energy production from the first bad category to the second bad category. Since coal is the most prominent source of electricity in the world, and coal emits about 1.5 times more carbon than oil per joule of energy produced, EVs are actually worse emissions culprits than gas cars.</p><p>When you read about EVs or talk to people about them, you&#8217;ll hear this theory come up <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/17/unplug-the-volt/\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-10/opinion/ct-oped-0810-goldberg-20100810_1_electric-cars-chevy-volt-ev1\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102273164\" target=\"_blank\">again</a> and <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/049504_electric_cars_ethanol_greenwashing.html#\" target=\"_blank\">again</a>.</p><p>The thing you&#8217;ll notice, though, is that every time you hear someone all mad about the long tailpipe emissions of EVs, they&#8217;re using wording like, &#8220;may be&#8221; and &#8220;often&#8221; and, in the case of Greg, &#8220;in some cases, some studies show.&#8221; That&#8217;s because you have to use words like that when you&#8217;re saying things that you wish were true but actually aren&#8217;t.</p><p>Taking the US as an example, here&#8217;s why they&#8217;re wrong:</p><p><strong>1) US electricity production is mixed, not just coal. </strong>Coal only makes up 39% of US electricity production. And that number&#8217;s going down:<a href=\"#footnote2-41-3667\" id=\"note2-41-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">41</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3818\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.56.42 PM\" width=\"633\" height=\"302\" /></a></p><p>Natural gas, which emits less than half the CO<sub>2</sub> of coal, now makes up over a quarter of US electricity production. Nuclear and renewables emit almost no CO<sub>2</sub> and now produce a third of US electricity.</p><p><strong>2) Energy production is more efficient in a power plant than it is in a car engine. </strong>To use an example with an identical source fuel, burning natural gas in a power plant is about <a href=\"http://www.npc.org/study_topic_papers/4-dtg-electricefficiency.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">60% efficient</a>, meaning 40% of the energy of the fuel is lost in the energy production process. In a car, burning gas is less than 25% efficient, with the vast majority of the energy lost to heat. The larger more complex system at a power plant will always be far better at capturing waste heat than a tiny car engine. The increased efficiency means that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">even a car running <em>purely </em>on coal-generated electricity will emit carbon at the same rate as a gas car that gets 30 miles per gallon</span>—which would be a significantly cleaner-than-average gas car.</p><p>Because the breakdown of energy source is different in different states, an EV will be greener in some places than others. The US Department of Energy has a <a href=\"http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php\" target=\"_blank\">great tool</a> to assess exactly how an EV stacks up against a gas car in any zip code in the country.</p><p>In the parts of the country that use very little coal, like upstate New York, an EV&#8217;s well-to-wheel emissions are <em>far </em>less than that of a gas car (on the chart, HEV = a traditional hybrid car, PHEV = a plug-in hybrid car):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3724\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.05.59 PM\" width=\"601\" height=\"268\" /></a></p><p>In the heaviest coal states, like Colorado, EVs cause a lot more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions—but still less than a gas car:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3723\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.04.39 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"270\" /></a></p><p>The national average is somewhere in between, putting an EV at 61% of a gas car&#8217;s emissions overall:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3725\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.06.20 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"262\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Union of Concerned Scientists</a><a href=\"#footnote-24-3667\" id=\"note-24-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a> came up with a way to directly compare car emissions, regardless of the type of car it is—a metric called &#8220;miles per gallon equivalent,&#8221; or MPG<sub>ghg</sub> (ghg stands for greenhouse gases).</p><p>MPG<sub>ghg</sub> is how many miles per gallon a gas car would need to achieve in order to match the carbon emissions of an EV (in the EV&#8217;s case, the emissions come from the plant that makes the electricity). In other words, if an EV gets 40 MPG<sub>ghg</sub>, it means it emits the exact same amount of carbon as a gas car that gets 40 MPG.</p><p>The average new gas car gets 23 MPG. Anything above 30 MPG is really good for a gas car, and anything below 15 or 17 is bad. For reference, remember that an EV running on <em>just </em>coal-produced electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg </sub>of 30 (so even in a hypothetical entirely coal-powered state, an EV would be the same as a highly efficient gas car), and an EV running on just natural gas-powered electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg</sub> of 54 and just top the Toyota Prius, which runs at 50 MPG.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a useful map that shows the kind of MPG<sub>ghg</sub> EVs get in different parts of the US:<a href=\"#footnote2-42-3667\" id=\"note2-42-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">42</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3828\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg\" alt=\"MPG Map\" width=\"738\" height=\"822\" /></a></p><p>So even for the 17% of the population living in the worst coal states, an EV beats almost all gas cars. This sums it up:<a href=\"#footnote2-43-3667\" id=\"note2-43-3667\" rel=\"footnote2\">43</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3721\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.52.33 PM\" width=\"672\" height=\"197\" /></a></p><p>And the thing is, each year, that already-nicely-positioned blue bar will make a little jump to the right. Because the grid is getting cleaner every year, it means an EV gets cleaner as time goes by. Gas cars are locked where they are, and they&#8217;ll be stuck watching as the future pulls away from them.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>I didn&#8217;t feel strongly about this topic before I spent a lot of recent time learning about it—and now that I have, I kind of think the only way someone could feel positive about a gas car future is if they&#8217;re misinformed, personally financially interested in gas cars, hopelessly old-fashioned, drunk with politics, or kind of just being a dick? Right? They would have to be one of those five things to be super pro-gas car—right?</p><p>The battle going on isn&#8217;t about gas cars vs. electric cars. That one&#8217;s already decided. This is a war about time. Oil companies will try to slow things down, and they may succeed—but they&#8217;re not winning this one. I just don&#8217;t see how they could. A company that makes lantern fuel can stay strong for a while by shielding the public from understanding what a light bulb is, but eventually, people will figure it out and lanterns will be out of business, bringing the lantern fuel company down with it. Greasy hoods are old, noisy acceleration is old, overheating engines are old, oil changes are old, and it won&#8217;t be long before everyone realizes that. A fun field trip in 2050 will be taking your grandkid to see an old 20th-century gas station and explaining how it worked.<a href=\"#footnote-25-3667\" id=\"note-25-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a> Driving a gas car is like littering on a camping trail, smoking on an airplane, and throwing a big stack of paper in the trash, and it&#8217;s just a matter of time until public disgust catches up to it.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Zooming Back Out</strong></span></p><p>Learning to harness the dragon of fire launched our modern world, and still today, we live in the age of burning. But we need to move on—we need to stop plowing through the trust fund and get a job. The dog needs to let the cave go. We need to learn to make energy the adult way—sustainably.</p><p>The sustainable energy world of the future—the yellow zone of our <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png\" target=\"_blank\">timeline</a> from earlier in the post—is simple. It looks like this:</p><p><strong>1) Almost everything we use will run on electricity.</strong></p><p><strong>2) Almost all of our electricity will be produced from sustainable sources.</strong></p><p>That&#8217;s a world running on sunlight and electricity, and burning has no part in that world.</p><p>This transition will happen in steps, over time. At the beginning of the post, we identified the two problems we needed to address most urgently: 1) Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty. 2) Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</p><p>We spent the rest of the post zoomed in on Problem 2 to examine how things got that way, stayed that way, and why we may be witnessing the moment it finally changes.</p><p>We won&#8217;t get into Problem 1 today—but both Musk, through the US-leading solar panel installation company he co-founded, <a href=\"http://www.solarcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SolarCity</a>, and Tesla, with their new product, the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall\" target=\"_blank\">Powerwall</a> stationary battery,<a href=\"#footnote-26-3667\" id=\"note-26-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a> are leading the way in this half of the energy equation too. For those interested, I put up a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html\" target=\"_blank\">mini post</a> on solar power and SolarCity.</p><p>People don&#8217;t quite realize it yet, but as of this moment, a family or business has the option to individually move themselves into the sustainable future. Using products made by SolarCity and Tesla alone, you can today live in a home and drive a car that are both powered by a solar panel-connected battery and live entirely on sunlight. Musk and his companies have made a little yellow brick road right out of the Fossil Fuel Era for anyone who wants to leave. And if modern technology can allow individual people, businesses, or even whole cities to live without fossil fuels, it hints that the only era any of us has ever known might be soon coming to an end.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>How to Change the World</strong></span></p><p>A study of Tesla isn&#8217;t about a car or a car company—it&#8217;s about how change happens. And about why it often doesn&#8217;t happen.</p><p>Our intuition tells us that technology, social norms, movements and ideas just move forward through time, as if forward progress is a river and those things are on a raft gliding through. We so associate the passage of time with progress that we use the term &#8220;the future&#8221; to refer to a better, more advanced version of our present world.</p><p>In reality, if a more advanced future does happen, it&#8217;s because that future was <em>willed</em> into our lives by a few brave people. The present isn&#8217;t welcoming of an advanced future because the present is run by a thick canopy made up of the<span class=\"s1\"> ideas, norms, and technologies of the <em>past. </em>There&#8217;ll be incremental tweaks and slight iterations on proven-to-work concepts, which may <em>seem </em>to us like moving into the future, but it&#8217;s really just a polishing up of the past.</span></p><p>When the real change arrives, you know you&#8217;re seeing it. <span class=\"s1\">It&#8217;s a distinct and exhilarating feeling when you witness a disrupting innovator ram its way through the canopy. I had that feeling when I watched Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OEsI0Sc_s\" target=\"_blank\">introduce</a> the iPhone in 2007. Before that moment, I had assumed that the ubiquitous Blackberrys and Nokias and Razors of the world were cutting-edge technology—but that keynote was an epiphany about how buried in the past those phones actually were. You don&#8217;t realize your Blackberry sucks until the iPhone exists. The feeling I had watching that keynote is the same feeling I had when I was six and I saw someone type on a computer word processor for the first time, and the last word on the line would magically jump to the line below when it hit the edge. Typewriters, which had seemed normal that morning, were suddenly ancient. The same thing happened when I saw the first iPod and became instantly disgusted with my horribly clunky and inefficient big booklet of CDs.</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I had this feeling again, last month, when I test drove a Tesla Model S. I had driven to the Tesla factory that morning in what had felt like a brand new rental car, and I left the factory in the same car, now feeling like a 1982 model. I get now why Matthew Inman <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s\" target=\"_blank\">calls</a> his Model S a &#8220;magical space car&#8221;—because that&#8217;s how it felt. That&#8217;s how a new, revolutionary technology always feels. Our modern world became as advanced as it is not by floating up an inevitable advancement river, but because of a collection of moments over time when a person or company has done something that makes everyone&#8217;s jaw drop.</span></p><p>But those world-changing moments don&#8217;t just smoothly glide into the world: these leaps into the future usually have to <span class=\"s1\"><em>jam </em>themselves through the canopy and then battle to keep themselves there. The past, which likes to loiter casually in our present world, hates when a piece of the future bursts onto the scene, because that exposes the past for being what it really is—the past. So a new and disruptive technology is often met with hostility as it emerges, as the existing canopy does whatever it can to squash the potential disruptor out of existence before it can gain momentum and start to spread. The old guard knows that once a disruptor gets a foothold and starts quickly spreading its ideas, the entire game changes—and once that balance tips, now instead of trying to squash the disruptor, everyone has to scramble </span><span class=\"s1\">to try to <em>emulate</em> it.</span></p><p>What Tesla is doing right now is an up-close example of how that kind of change happens.</p><p>The idea to change the car industry started as brainwaves zipping around Elon Musk&#8217;s head, as Christie Nicholson learned the hard way, but Musk couldn&#8217;t do much about it on his own. To make the idea real, he had to <em>scale </em>those brainwaves up, and he did that by building Tesla. That brought a new player into the car industry, run by a collective super-brain made up of 11,000 Tesla employees who also happened to think a lot about electric cars.</p><p>Change doesn&#8217;t happen on a familiar landscape—change has to construct the landscape itself. This is part of the reason the challenges Tesla has taken on are so enormous. Henry Ford didn&#8217;t just build a car—he built a landscape, defining what a car was. Since then, car companies have worked within Ford&#8217;s landscape. Bringing back what Musk said about Ford—<em>He was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn’t know what they needed</em>—it&#8217;s clear that this is exactly what Musk and Tesla are doing right now. If there aren&#8217;t enough charging stations for long-trips, build an energy network of Superchargers. If scalability is held back by the high price of lithium-ion batteries, build a factory that doubles the world supply of them to bring the price down. Just get it done.</p><p>But with a goal as ambitious as &#8220;accelerating the advent of sustainable transport&#8221; and a victory condition as far-reaching as &#8220;half of all new cars being electric,&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote-27-3667\" id=\"note-27-3667\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a> building one great car company isn&#8217;t enough. To bring Musk&#8217;s original idea to the next level, Tesla would need to scale <em>itself</em>. To do that, Tesla is building a line of cars so stellar that it&#8217;s going to change the public&#8217;s expectations of a what a car should be, and the whole industry will have to adjust to that new expectation.</p><p>And by solving so many EV problems for its own cars, it&#8217;s forging the path to an EV-dominated world for all the other companies too. A company trying to rise to the top of their industry would hold their innovation secrets close—but because Tesla&#8217;s goal is to<em> transform</em> the industry, in 2014, Tesla made <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you\" target=\"_blank\">all of their patents</a> available to whomever wanted them.</p><p class=\"p1\">Other companies are critical to the mission, because Tesla&#8217;s goal is to ramp production up to 500,000 cars, which is only around half a percent of the total cars made each year. He explained, &#8220;The impact that Tesla will have is fairly small in and of itself. It will change people’s perception perhaps, but it will not in and of itself change the world. But if large numbers of people are choosing to buy the Model 3, and the car companies see that there’s no excuse left anymore because the car’s long range and the car’s handling and acceleration is better in every way than a gasoline car, and it&#8217;s affordable—and people are pretty sure this is what they want to buy—then that&#8217;s what will prompt car companies to invest real money into electric vehicle programs of their own, and indirectly, by spurring competition, Tesla can be the catalyst for a multi-order of magnitude shift of the entire industry towards electric.&#8221;</p><p>That&#8217;s how to spread the brainwaves of a single person throughout a huge industry and the global public—and by the time it&#8217;s done, everyone will think a lot about electric cars.</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about something, or maybe something unexpected happens—but from what I&#8217;ve seen, read, and talked about, it really seems like Tesla is going to fulfill its mission and change the world. It&#8217;s going to <em>accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. </em>If the Model 3 ends up being as great as they say it&#8217;s gonna be, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that electric cars will be the norm far earlier than they would have been. Which will, in turn, mean that 50 years from now, the atmosphere&#8217;s CO<sub>2</sub> level will probably be lower than it would have otherwise been, cities will be less smoggy than they would have otherwise been, global temperatures will be lower than they would have otherwise been, the sad polar bear will get to eat seals again, along with about 12 other positive effects that will legitimately affect our lives. Pretty down-the-middle definition of changing the world.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is what Musk spends <em>two</em> days of his week on.

The sun is full of particles that have mass. Mass has gravitational potential energy. When so many particles are gathered in one place like they are in the sun, they squish together unpleasantly until they combine with each other, which is called nuclear fusion, and it&#8217;s an intense process that releases a ton of energy. So to say it boringly, the gravitational potential energy of the sun&#8217;s particles ignites fusion, which generates radiation energy, and that&#8217;s the energy we receive from the sun on Earth. I&#8217;m regretful that this was the first footnote, because people are likely to click on the first one to see whether footnotes are actually interesting or not and then plan accordingly from there—and this was a kind of dull first footnote.<a href=\"#note-2-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-3-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>A calorie is about 4 joules.<a href=\"#note-3-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-4-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>People would indicate the power of a particular steam engine by how many horses it could replace—the origin of the term &#8220;horsepower.&#8221;<a href=\"#note-4-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-5-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>When you see power lines on the street, all they&#8217;re doing is delivering the joules of a far-away fire to people&#8217;s homes.

General Motors actually had made a great electric car in the 90s that customers loved, called the EV1. But GM realized that if the car caught on too much, the California mandate would look like a huge success and other states might decide to do it too. Meanwhile, customers might also decide they all wanted electric cars. None of this would be ideal, considering that GM makes 10 million new cars a year, 99.9% of them run on gas, and it would suck if GM&#8217;s entire inventory was suddenly seen as outdated. So GM and the other companies did their best <em>not </em>to sell their electric cars, to show how little the world wanted them and how big a failure the California mandate was. After using all the muscle they had to shut down the mandate (with the help of the Bush administration, whose Chief of Staff, Andy Card, was CEO of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association previously), car companies whisked the new electric vehicles they had made off the roads. GM, who had only <em>leased</em> the EV1 to customers, demanded each one returned, against the pleading wishes of their lessees, and then had all of them crushed like the mafia offing a bad apple they wanted to make disappear. EV1 lovers staged a <em>funeral</em> for the cars. Not many instances in history when a company has torn a product away from paying customers who cared so much about it they&#8217;d read eulogies about it. The well-made documentary <a href=\"http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Who Killed the Electric Car?</em></a>, made in 2006,<em> </em>tells the whole story (the sequel, <a href=\"http://www.revengeoftheelectriccar.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Revenge of the Electric Car</em></a>, made in 2011, tells the story of Tesla and the recent resurgence of the electric vehicle market).<a href=\"#note-12-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-13-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk reportedly did not get laid that night.<a href=\"#note-13-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-14-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Alternating current is the type of current that comes out of your home outlets and it generates power by electrons moving back and forth in a quick vibration in the wire. This is opposed to DC, or direct current, which is the more intuitive type, used with batteries, where electrons flow through a wire in a single direction (since electric cars use batteries, the battery produces direct current, which then has to be converted into alternating current through a box in the car called an inverter). Back in the 1880s, Thomas Edison, who was heavily invested in DC, engaged in a battle with George Westinghouse, who had teamed up with Nikola Tesla to push AC, over the best way to power homes. This was called The War of Currents. Tesla&#8217;s AC won because it could travel over much larger distances without overheating—Edison&#8217;s way would have needed lots of small power stations so that each home was relatively close to one of them, while AC could be produced in a huge power plant and then travel far away through a grid.<a href=\"#note-14-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-15-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Faraday, who discovered induction, was their second choice.<a href=\"#note-15-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-16-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I cued up <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MmQb94EF1UY?t=29m14s\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> to where you can hear Musk call hydrogen cars &#8220;bullshit&#8221; and then go on a little rant about them.<a href=\"#note-16-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-17-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Among many reasons hydrogen cars seem inferior to EVs, here are four:</p><p>1) Hydrogen cars seem beholden to natural gas, a fossil fuel, in order to extract the hydrogen fuel, while electric cars get cleaner over time as electricity production gets cleaner.</p><p>2) When it comes to energy density, driving range, and cost, the best case scenario for hydrogen cells is similar to where EV batteries are now, and EV batteries will get better with time.</p><p>3) Hydrogen is a somewhat dangerous and difficult-to-handle substance that&#8217;s a nightmare compared to the simple wall-outlet electricity EVs use.</p><p>4) Down the road, when the norm is to charge the car up in your garage, it&#8217;s going to seem primitive to have to go to a station to fuel up.</p><p>In an email exchange I had with Musk about hydrogen cars, he explained it like this:</p><p><em>If you take electricity coming from a solar panel and charge a battery, you can get ~90% efficiency. Simple and cheap. Instead, if you use that electricity to split water, separate the hydrogen with extreme purity, pressurize it to crazy levels (or, even worse, liquefy), transfer it to a giant (even in liquid form) hydrogen storage tank in the car and then recombine it with oxygen to generate electricity, you would be lucky to get ~20% efficiency. Expensive, complex, bulky and super inefficient. It loses on every dimension, including refuel time when pack swap is factored in. </em></p><p><em>Cost is bad for fuel cells, but that is only one of many bad dimensions. If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million. They are not.</em></p><p>Finally, if I wasn&#8217;t already convinced, this highly-detailed, fairly devastating <a href=\"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/04/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-about-not-clean/\" target=\"_blank\">takedown</a> of the argument hydrogen cars left me feeling eternally puzzled about why the Japanese companies would want to go further down that road.<a href=\"#note-17-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-18-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>When you click a footnote next to &#8220;kWh,&#8221; you&#8217;re signing up to learn what a kWh is. Here we go:</p><p>A watt isn&#8217;t a unit of energy, it&#8217;s a <em>rate </em>of energy usage—which is a unit of <em>power</em>. The unit of <em>energy </em>is the joule (which itself is the energy required to move one newton one meter). 1 watt = 1 joule/second. 1 kilowatt is 1,000 joules/second. A megawatt is 1 million joules/second, and a gigawatt is 1 billion joules/second. They&#8217;re units of power.</p><p>But a watt-<em>hour, </em>like a joule, is a unit of <em>energy. </em>It&#8217;s the amount of energy needed to run something at a rate of one watt for one hour. When we talk about car batteries, we don&#8217;t use joules because the numbers would be too big and inconvenient. Instead, we use kWh. 1 kWh = 1,000 joules/second over an entire hour = 3,600,000 joules.<a href=\"#note-18-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-19-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>At the time, they didn&#8217;t own the rights to the name yet—some guy in Sacramento did.<a href=\"#note-19-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-20-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>They were both so sad about this that they still aren&#8217;t on speaking terms today.<a href=\"#note-20-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-21-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk&#8217;s thoughts on the role of CEO: &#8220;The CEO receives the distillation of all the worst problems in the company, only spending time on the things that are going wrong, and you get all the stuff other people can’t take care of, so you have a filter for the crappiest problems in the company.&#8221;<a href=\"#note-21-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-22-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>I&#8217;m sick of writing von Holzhausen with the little v and the upsetting spelling and I wish he had a different name.<a href=\"#note-22-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-23-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>In the almost-an-EV world of plug-in hybrids, the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/chevrolet-volt\" target=\"_blank\">Chevy Volt</a> ($35,000, 38 mile range before gas kicks in) and the <a href=\"http://plugincars.com/toyota-prius-plugin-hybrid\" target=\"_blank\">Toyota Prius Plug-In</a> ($31,000, 11 mi range before gas) are the clear leaders.<a href=\"#note-23-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-24-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>No one in the world sounds less fun to hang out with than a group of concerned scientists.<a href=\"#note-24-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-25-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCs8B-TlylY\" target=\"_blank\">This Nissan commercial</a> does a good job of hammering home the message.<a href=\"#note-25-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-26-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>You can watch Musk explain everything about the Powerwall <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<a href=\"#note-26-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><li id=\"footnote-27-3667\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Musk has a bet going with someone that that will happen by 2027.<a href=\"#note-27-3667\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div><div class=\"footnotes2\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote2-1-3667\" class=\"footnote2\"><p>Gray square footnotes are as boring as you&#8217;d think a gray square footnote would be.

Remember in the 1990s, when we would call strangers and give them our credit-card numbers? Elon dreamed up a little thing called PayPal. His Tesla Motors and SolarCity companies are making a clean, renewable-energy future a reality…his SpaceX [is] reopening space for exploration…it’s a paradox that Elon is working to improve our planet at the same time he’s building spacecraft to help us leave it.</em></p><p>So no, that was not a phone call I had been expecting.</p><p>A few days later, I found myself in pajama pants, pacing frantically around my apartment, on the phone with Elon Musk. We had a discussion about Tesla, SpaceX, the automotive and aerospace and solar power industries, and he told me what he thought confused people about each of these things. He suggested that if these were topics I’d be interested in writing about, and it might be helpful, I could come out to California and sit down with him in person for a longer discussion.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3625\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call1.png\" alt=\"2Call1\" width=\"400\" height=\"291\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call21.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3653\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Call21.png\" alt=\"2Call2\" width=\"400\" height=\"271\" /></a></p><p>For me, this project was one of the biggest no-brainers in history. Not just because Elon Musk is Elon Musk, but because here are two <em>separate </em>items that have been sitting for a while in my “Future Post Topics” document, verbatim:</p><p>– “electric vs hybrid vs gas cars, deal with tesla, sustainable energy”</p><p>– “spacex, musk, mars?? how learn to do rockets??”</p><p>I already wanted to write about these topics, for the same reason I <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> Artificial Intelligence—I knew they would be hugely important in the future but that I also didn’t understand them well enough. And Musk is leading a revolution in both of these worlds.</p><p>It would be like if you had plans to write about the process of throwing lightning bolts and then one day out of the blue Zeus called and asked if you wanted to question him about a lot of stuff.</p><p>So it was on. The plan was that I’d come out to California, see the Tesla and SpaceX factories, meet with some of the engineers at each company, and have an extended sit down with Musk. <em>Exciting.</em></p><p>The first order of business was to have a full panic. I needed to not sit down with these people—these world-class engineers and rocket scientists—and know almost nothing about anything. I had a lot of quick learning to do.</p><p>The problem with Elon Fucking Musk, though, is that he happens to be involved in <em>all </em>of the following industries:</p><ul><li>Automotive</li><li>Aerospace</li><li>Solar Energy</li><li>Energy Storage</li><li>Satellite</li><li>High-Speed Ground Transportation</li><li>And, um, Multi-Planetary Expansion</li></ul><p>Zeus would have been less stressful.</p><p>So I spent the two weeks leading up to the West Coast visit reading and reading and reading, and it became quickly clear that this was gonna need to be a multi-post series. There’s a <em>lot </em>to get into.</p><p>We’ll dive deep into Musk’s companies and the industries surrounding them in the coming posts, but today, let’s start by going over exactly who this dude is and why he’s such a big deal.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3623\" id=\"note-1-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-2-3623\" id=\"note2-2-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><sup>← <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">click these</span></sup></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The Making of Elon Musk</strong></span></p><p><em>Note: There’s a great biography on Musk coming out May 19th, written by tech writer Ashlee Vance. I was able to get an advance copy, and it’s been a key source in putting together these posts. I’m going to keep to a brief overview of his life here—if you want the full story, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062301233/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062301233&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=UMV6CN256IWSDQDR\" target=\"_blank\">get the bio</a>.</em></p><p>Musk was born in 1971 in South Africa. Childhood wasn’t a great time for him—he had a tough family life and never fit in well at school.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3623\" id=\"note-2-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> But, like you often read in the bios of extraordinary people, he was an avid self-learner early on. His brother Kimbal has said Elon would often read for 10 hours a day—a lot of science fiction and eventually, a lot of non-fiction too. By fourth grade, he was constantly buried in the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica. </i></p><p>One thing you’ll learn about Musk as you read these posts is that he thinks of humans as computers, which, in their most literal sense, they are. A human’s hardware is his physical body and brain. His software is the way he learns to think, his value system, his habits, his personality. And learning, for Musk, is simply the process of “downloading data and algorithms into your brain.”<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3623\" id=\"note2-3-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> Among his many frustrations with formal classroom learning is the “ridiculously slow download speed” of sitting in a classroom while a teacher explains something, and to this day, most of what he knows he’s learned through reading.</p><p>He became consumed with a second fixation at the age of nine when he got his hands on his first computer, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore VIC-20</a>. It came with five kilobytes of memory and a “how to program” guide that was intended to take the user six months to complete. Nine-year-old Elon finished it in three days. At 12, he used his skills to create a video game called Blastar, which he told me was “a trivial game…but better than Flappy Bird.” But in 1983, it was good enough to be sold to a computer magazine for $500 ($1,200 in today’s money)—not bad for a 12-year-old.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3623\" id=\"note-3-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p>Musk never felt much of a connection to South Africa—he didn’t fit in with the jockish, white Afrikaner culture, and it was a nightmare country for a potential entrepreneur. He saw Silicon Valley as the Promised Land, and at the age of 17, he left South Africa forever. He started out in Canada, which was an easier place to immigrate to because his mom is a Canadian citizen, and a few years later, used a college transfer to the University of Pennsylvania as a way into the US.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3623\" id=\"note-4-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p>In college, he thought about what he wanted to do with his life, using as his starting point the question, “What will most affect the future of humanity?” The answer he came up with was a list of five things: “the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3623\" id=\"note2-4-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p>He was iffy about how positive the impact of the latter two would be, and though he was optimistic about each of the first three, he never considered at the time that he’d ever be involved in space exploration. That left the internet and sustainable energy as his options.</p><p>He decided to go with sustainable energy. After finishing college, he enrolled in a Stanford PhD program to study high energy density capacitors, a technology aimed at coming up with a more efficient way than traditional batteries to store energy—which he knew could be key to a sustainable energy future and help accelerate the advent of an electric car industry.</p><p>But two days into the program, he got massive FOMO because it was 1995 and he “couldn’t stand to just watch the internet go by—[he] wanted to jump in and make it better.”<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3623\" id=\"note2-5-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a> So he dropped out and decided to try the internet instead.</p><p>His first move was to go try to get a job at the monster of the 1995 internet, Netscape. The tactic he came up with was to walk into the lobby, uninvited, stand there awkwardly, be too shy to talk to anyone, and walk out.</p><p>Musk bounced back from the unimpressive career beginning by teaming up with his brother Kimbal (who had followed Elon to the US) to start their own company—Zip2. Zip2 was like a primitive combination of Yelp and Google Maps, far before anything like either of those existed. The goal was to get businesses to realize that being in the Yellow Pages would become outdated at some point and that it was a good idea to get themselves into an online directory. The brothers had no money, slept in the office and showered at the YMCA, and Elon, their lead programmer, sat obsessively at his computer working around the clock. In 1995, it was hard to convince businesses that the internet was important—many told them that advertising on the internet sounded like “the dumbest thing they had ever heard of”<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3623\" id=\"note2-6-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a>—but eventually, they began to rack up customers and the company grew. It was the heat of the 90s internet boom, startup companies were being snatched up left and right, and in 1999, Compaq snatched up Zip2 for $307 million. Musk, who was 27, made off with $22 million.</p><p>In what would become a recurring theme for Musk, he finished one venture and immediately dove into a new, harder, more complex one. If he were following the dot-com millionaire rulebook, he’d have known that what you’re supposed to do after hitting it big during the 90s boom is either retire off into the sunset of leisure and angel investing, or if you still have ambition, start a new company with someone else’s money. But Musk doesn’t tend to follow normal rulebooks, and he plunged three quarters of his net worth into his new idea, an outrageously bold plan to build essentially an online bank—replete with checking, savings, and brokerage accounts—called X.com. This seems less insane now, but in 1999, an internet startup trying to compete with the large banks was unheard of.</p><p>In the same building that X.com worked out of was another internet finance company called Confinity, founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin. One of X.com’s many features was an easy money-transfer service, and later, Confinity would develop a similar service. Both companies began to notice a strong demand for their money-transfer service, which put the two companies in sudden furious competition with each other, and they finally decided to just merge into what we know today as PayPal.</p><p>This brought together a lot of egos and conflicting opinions—Musk was now joined by Peter Thiel and a bunch of other now-super-successful internet guys—and despite the company growing rapidly, things inside the office did not go smoothly. The conflicts boiled over in late 2000, and when Musk was on a half fundraising trip / half honeymoon (with his first wife Justine), the anti-Musk crowd staged a coup and replaced him as CEO with Thiel. Musk handled this surprisingly well, and to this day, he says he doesn’t agree with that decision but he understands why they did it. He stayed on the team in a senior role, continued investing in the company, and played an instrumental role in selling the company to eBay in 2002, for $1.5 billion. Musk, the company’s largest shareholder, walked away with $180 million (after taxes).<a href=\"#footnote-5-3623\" id=\"note-5-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p>If there was ever a semblance of the normal life rulebook in Musk’s decision-making, it was at this point in his life—as a beyond-wealthy 31-year-old in 2002—that he dropped the rulebook into the fire for good.</p><p>The subject of what he did over the next 13 years leading up to today is what we’ll thoroughly explore over the rest of this series. For now, here’s the short story:</p><p>In 2002, before the sale of PayPal even went through, Musk starting voraciously reading about rocket technology, and later that year, with $100 million, he started one of the most unthinkable and ill-advised ventures of all time: a rocket company called SpaceX, whose stated purpose was to revolutionize the cost of space travel in order to make humans a multi-planetary species by colonizing Mars with at least a million people over the next century.</p><p>Mm hm.</p><p>Then, in 2004, as that “project” was just getting going, Musk decided to multi-task by launching the second-most unthinkable and ill-advised venture of all time: an electric car company called Tesla, whose stated purpose was to revolutionize the worldwide car industry by significantly accelerating the advent of a mostly-electric-car world—in order to bring humanity on a huge leap toward a sustainable energy future. Musk funded this one personally as well, pouring in $70 million, despite the tiny fact that the last time a US car startup succeeded was Chrysler in 1925, and the last time someone<em> </em>started a successful <em>electric</em> car startup was never.</p><p>And since why the fuck not, a couple years later, in 2006, he threw in $10 million to found, with his cousins, <em>another </em>company, called SolarCity, whose goal was to revolutionize energy production by creating a large, distributed utility that would install solar panel systems on millions of people’s homes, dramatically reducing their consumption of fossil fuel-generated electricity and ultimately “accelerating mass adoption of sustainable energy.”<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3623\" id=\"note2-7-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p>If you were observing all of this in those four years following the PayPal sale, you’d think it was a sad story. A delusional internet millionaire, comically in over his head with a slew of impossible projects, doing everything he could to squander his fortune.</p><p>By 2008, this seemed to be playing out, to the letter. SpaceX had figured out how to build rockets, just not rockets that actually worked—it had attempted three launches so far and all three had blown up before reaching orbit. In order to bring in any serious outside investment or payload contracts, SpaceX had to show that they could successfully launch a rocket—but Musk said he had funds left for one and only one more launch. If the fourth launch also failed, SpaceX would be done.</p><p>Meanwhile, up in the Bay Area, Tesla was also in the shit. They had yet to deliver their first car—the Tesla Roadster—to the market, which didn’t look good to the outside world. Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag made the Tesla Roadster its #1 tech company fail of 2007. This would have been more okay if the global economy hadn’t suddenly crashed, hitting the automotive industry the absolute hardest and sucking dry any flow of investments into car companies, especially new and unproven ones. And Tesla was running out of money fast.</p><p>During this double implosion of his career, the one thing that held stable and strong in Musk’s life was his marriage of eight years, if by stable and strong you mean falling apart entirely in a soul-crushing, messy divorce.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>But here’s the thing—Musk is not a fool, and he hadn’t built bad companies. He had built very, <em>very </em>good companies. It’s just that creating a reliable rocket is unfathomably difficult, as is launching a startup car company, and because no one wanted to invest in what seemed to the outside world like overambitious and probably-doomed ventures—especially during a recession—Musk had to rely on his own personal funds. PayPal made him rich, but not rich enough to keep these companies afloat for very long on his own. Without outside money, both SpaceX and Tesla had a short runway. So it’s not that SpaceX and Tesla were bad—it’s that they needed more time to succeed, and they were out of time.</p><p>And then, in the most dire hour, everything turned around.</p><p>First, in September of 2008, SpaceX launched their fourth rocket—and their last one if it didn’t successfully put a payload into orbit—and it succeeded. Perfectly.</p><p>That was enough for NASA to say “fuck it, let’s give this Musk guy a try,” and it took a gamble, offering SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to carry out 12 launches for the agency. Runway extended. SpaceX saved.</p><p><em>The next day,</em> on Christmas Eve 2008, when Musk scrounged up the last money he could manage to keep Tesla going, Tesla’s investors reluctantly agreed to match his investment. Runway extended. Five months later, things began looking up, and another critical investment came in—$50 million from Daimler. Tesla saved.</p><p>While 2008 hardly marked the end of the bumps in the road for Musk, the overarching story of the next seven years would be the soaring, earthshaking success of Elon Musk and his companies.</p><p>Since their first three failed launches, SpaceX has launched 20 times—all successes. NASA is now a regular client, and one of many, since the innovations at SpaceX have allowed companies to launch things to space for the lowest cost in history. Within those 20 launches have been all kinds of “firsts” for a commercial rocket company—to this day, the four entities in history who have managed to launch a spacecraft into orbit and successfully return it to Earth are the US, Russia, China—and SpaceX. SpaceX is currently testing their new spacecraft, which will bring humans to space, and they’re busy at work on the much larger rocket that will be able to bring 100 people to Mars at once. A recent investment by Google and Fidelity has valued the company at $12 billion.</p><p>Tesla’s Model S has become a smashing success, blowing away the automotive industry with the highest ever Consumer Reports rating of a 99/100, and the highest safety rating in history from the National Highway Safety Administration, a 5.4/5. Now they’re getting closer and closer to releasing their true disruptor—the much more affordable Model 3—and the company’s market cap is just under $30 billion. They’re also becoming the world’s most formidable battery company, currently working on their giant Nevada “Gigafactory,” which will more than double the world’s <em>total </em>annual production of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>SolarCity, which went public in 2012, now has a market cap of just under $6 billion and has become the largest installer of solar panels in the US. They’re now building the country’s largest solar panel-manufacturing factory in Buffalo, and they’ll likely be entering into a partnership with Tesla to package their product with Tesla’s new home battery, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVjW9XdPlhg\" target=\"_blank\">Powerwall</a>.</p><p>And since that’s not enough, in his spare time, Musk is pushing the development a whole new mode of transport—the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop</a>.</p><p>In a couple of years, when their newest factories are complete, Musk’s three companies will employ over 30,000 people. After nearly going broke in 2008 and telling a friend that he and his wife may have to “move into his wife’s parents’ basement,”<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3623\" id=\"note2-8-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a> Musk’s current net worth <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">clocks in</a> at $12.9 billion.</p><p>All of this has made Musk somewhat of a living legend. In building a successful automotive startup and its worldwide network of Supercharger stations, Musk has been compared to visionary industrialists like Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. The pioneering work of SpaceX on rocket technology has led to comparisons to Howard Hughes, and many have drawn parallels between Musk and Thomas Edison because of the advancements in engineering Musk has been able to achieve across industries. Perhaps most often, he’s compared to Steve Jobs, for his remarkable ability to disrupt giant, long-stagnant industries with things customers didn’t even know they wanted. Some believe he’ll be remembered in a class of his own. Tech writer and Musk biographer Ashlee Vance has suggested that what Musk is building “has the potential to be much grander than anything Hughes or Jobs produced. Musk has taken industries like aerospace and automotive that America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new and fantastic.”<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3623\" id=\"note2-9-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/F.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-3657\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/F.jpg\" alt=\"F\" width=\"219\" height=\"148\" /></a>Chris Anderson, who runs TED Talks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUMZTtQU10o\" target=\"_blank\">calls</a> Musk “the world’s most remarkable living entrepreneur.” Others know him as “the real life Iron Man,” and not for no reason—Jon Favreau actually sent Robert Downey, Jr. to spend time with Musk in the SpaceX factory prior to filming the first <em>Iron Man</em> movie so he could model his character off of Musk.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3623\" id=\"note2-10-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a> He’s even <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Musk_Who_Fell_to_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">been on</a> The Simpsons.</p><p>And this is the man I was somehow on the phone with as I frantically paced back and forth in my apartment, in pajama pants.</p><p>On the call, he made it clear that he wasn’t looking for me to advertise his companies—he only wanted me to help explain what’s going on in the worlds surrounding those companies and why the things happening with electric cars, sustainable energy production, and aerospace matter so much.</p><p>He seemed particularly bored with people spending time writing about <em>him—</em>he feels there are so many things of critical importance going on in the industries he’s involved in, and every time someone writes about him, he wishes they were writing about fossil fuel supply or battery advancements or the importance of making humanity multi-planetary (this is especially clear in the intro to the upcoming biography on him, when the author explains how <em>not</em> interested Musk was in having a bio written about him).</p><p>So I’m sure this first post, whose title is “Elon Musk: The World’s Raddest Man,” will annoy him.</p><p>But I have reasons. To me, there are two worthy areas of exploration in this post series:</p><p><strong>1) To understand why Musk is doing what he’s doing.</strong> He deeply believes that he’s taken on the most pressing possible causes to give humanity the best chance of a good future. I want to explore those causes in depth and the reasons he’s so concerned about them.</p><p><strong>2) To understand why Musk is <em>able to </em>do what he’s doing. </strong>There are a few people in each generation who dramatically change the world, and those people are worth studying. They do things differently from everyone else—and I think there’s a lot to learn from them.</p><p>So on my visit to California, I had two goals in mind: to understand as best I could what Musk and his teams were working on so feverishly and why it mattered so much, and to try to gain insight into what it is that makes him so capable of changing the world.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Visiting the Factories</strong></span></p><p>The Tesla Factory (in Northern CA) and the SpaceX Factory (in Southern CA), in addition to both being huge, and rad, have a lot in common.</p><p>Both factories are bright and clean, shiny and painted white, with super high ceilings. Both feel more like laboratories than traditional factories. And in both places, the engineers doing white collar jobs and the technicians doing blue collar jobs are deliberately placed in the same working quarters so they’ll work closely together and give each other feedback—and Musk believes it’s crucial for those designing the machines to be around those machines as they’re being manufactured. And while a traditional factory environment wouldn’t be ideal for an engineer on a computer and a traditional office environment wouldn’t be a good workplace for a technician, a clean, futuristic laboratory feels right for both professions. There are almost no closed offices in either factory—everyone is out in the open, exposed to everyone else.</p><p>When I pulled up to the Tesla factory (joined by Andrew), I was first taken by its size—and when I looked it up, I wasn’t surprised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_buildings_in_the_world\" target=\"_blank\">to see</a> that it has the second largest building footprint (aka base area) in the world.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6427.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3645\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6427.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6427\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" /></a></p><p>The factory was formerly jointly owned by GM and Toyota, who sold it to Tesla in 2010. We started off the day with a full tour of the factory—a sea of red robots making cars and being silly:<a href=\"#footnote-6-3623\" id=\"note-6-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6434.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3646\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6434.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6434\" width=\"700\" height=\"261\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6439.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3647\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6439.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6439\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6444.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3648\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6444.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6444\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p>And other cool things, like a vast section of the factory that just makes the car battery, and another that houses the 20,000 pound rolls of aluminum they slice and press and weld into Teslas.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/130.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3643\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/130.jpg\" alt=\"130\" width=\"600\" height=\"379\" /></a></p><p>And this giant press, which costs $50 million and presses metal with <em>4,500 tons </em>of pressure (the same pressure you’d get if you stacked 2,500 cars on top of something).</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/142.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3644\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/142.jpg\" alt=\"142\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a></p><p>The Tesla factory is working on upping its output from 30,000 cars/year to 50,000, or about 1,000 per week. They seemed to be pumping out cars incredibly quickly, so I was blown away to learn that Toyota had been on a 1,000 cars per <em>day </em>clip when they inhabited the factory.</p><p>I had a chance to visit the Tesla design studio (no pictures allowed), where there were designers sketching car designs on computer screens and, on the other side of the room, full-size car models made of clay. An actual-size clay version of the upcoming Model 3 was surrounded by specialists sculpting it with tiny instruments and blades, shaving off fractions of a millimeter to examine the way light bounced off the curves. There was also a 3D printer that could quickly “print” out a shoe-sized 3D model of a sketched Tesla design so a designer could actually hold their design and look at it from different angles. Deliciously futuristic.</p><p>The next day was the SpaceX factory, which might be even cooler, but the building contains advanced rocket technology, which according to the government is “weapons technology,” and apparently random bloggers aren’t allowed to take pictures of weapons technology.</p><p>Anyway, after the tours, I had a chance to sit down with several senior engineers and designers at both companies. They’d explain that they were a foremost expert in their field, I’d explain that I had recently figured out how big the building would be that could hold all humans, and we’d begin our discussion. I’d ask them about their work, their thoughts on the company as a whole and the broader industry, and then I’d ask them about their relationship with Elon and what it was like to work for him. Without exception, they were really nice-seeming, friendly people, who all came off as ridiculously smart but in a non-pretentious way. Musk has said he has a strict “no assholes” hiring policy, and I could see that at work in these meetings.</p><p>So what’s Musk like as a boss?</p><p>Let’s start by seeing what the internet says—there’s a <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-with-Elon-Musk\" target=\"_blank\">Quora thread</a> that poses the question: “What is it like to work with Elon Musk?”</p><p>The first answer is from a longtime SpaceX employee who no longer works there, who describes the day that their 3rd launch failed, a devastating blow for the company and for all the people who had worked for years to try to make it work.</p><p>She describes Elon emerging from mission command to address the company and delivering a rousing speech. She refers to Elon’s “infinite wisdom” and says, “I think most of us would have followed him into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil after that.  It was the most impressive display of leadership that I have ever witnessed.”</p><p>Right below that answer is another answer, from an anonymous SpaceX engineer, who describes working for Musk like this:</p><p>“You can always tell when someone’s left an Elon meeting: they’re defeated…nothing you ever do will be good enough so you have to find your own value, not depending on praise to get you through your obviously insufficient 80 hour work weeks.”</p><p>Reading about Musk online and in Vance’s book, I was struck by how representative both of these Quora comments were of whole camps of opinion on working for Musk. Doing so seems to bring out a tremendous amount of adoration and a tremendous amount of exasperation, sometimes with a tone of bitterness—and even more oddly, much of the time, you hear both sides of this story expressed by the same person. For example, later in the comment of the effusive Quora commenter comes “Working with him isn’t a comfortable experience, he is never satisfied with himself so he is never really satisfied with anyone around him…the challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t.” And the frustrated anonymous commenter later concedes that the way Elon is “is understandable” given the enormity of the task at hand, and that “it is a great company and I do love it.”</p><p>My own talks with Musk’s engineers and designers told a similar story. I was told: “Elon always wants to know, ‘Why are we not going faster?’ He always wants bigger, better, faster” by the same person who a few minutes later was emphasizing how fair and thoughtful Musk tends to be in handling the terms for a recently fired employee.</p><p>The same person who told me he has “lots of sleepless nights” said in the adjacent sentence how happy he is to be at the company and that he hopes to “never leave.”</p><p>One senior executive described interacting with Musk like this: “Any conversation’s fairly high stakes because he’ll be very opinionated, and he can go deeper than you expect or are prepared for or deeper than your knowledge goes on a given topic, and it does feel like a high wire act interacting with him, especially when you find yourself in a [gulp] technical disagreement.”<a href=\"#footnote-7-3623\" id=\"note-7-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> The same executive, who had previously worked at a huge tech company, also called Musk “the most grounded billionaire I’ve ever worked with.”</p><p>What I began to understand is that the explanation for both sides of the story—the cult-like adulation right alongside the grudging willingness to endure what sounds like blatant hell—comes down to respect. The people who work for Musk, no matter how they feel about his management style, feel an immense amount of respect—for his intelligence, for his work ethic, for his guts, and for the gravity of the missions he’s undertaken, missions that make all other potential jobs seem trivial and pointless.</p><p>Many of the people I talked to also alluded to their respect for his integrity. One way this integrity comes through is in his consistency. He’s been saying the same things in interviews for a decade, often using the same exact phrasing many years apart. He says what he really means, no matter the situation—one employee close to Musk told me that after a press conference or a business negotiation, once in private he’d ask Musk what his real angle was and what he <em>really </em>thinks. Musk’s response would always be boring: “I think exactly what I said.”</p><p>A few people I spoke with referenced Musk’s obsession with truth and accuracy. He’s fine with and even welcoming of negative criticism about him when he believes it’s accurate, but when the press gets something wrong about him or his companies, he usually can’t help himself and will engage them and correct their error. He detests vague spin-doctor phrases like “studies say” and “scientists disagree,” and he refuses to advertise for Tesla, something most startup car companies wouldn’t think twice about—because he sees advertising as manipulative and dishonest.</p><p>There’s even an undertone of integrity in Musk’s tyrannical demands of workers, because while he may be a tyrant, he’s not a hypocrite. Employees pressured to work 80 hours a week tend to be less bitter about it when at least the CEO is in there working 100.</p><p>Speaking of the CEO, let’s go have a hamburger with him.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>My Lunch With Elon</strong></span></p><p>It started like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3634\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-1.png\" alt=\"Lunch 1\" width=\"480\" height=\"398\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3635\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\" alt=\"Lunch 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"321\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3636\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-3.png\" alt=\"Lunch 3\" width=\"481\" height=\"382\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-4.png\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3638\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-5.png\" alt=\"Lunch 5\" width=\"479\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3639\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-6.png\" alt=\"Lunch 6\" width=\"481\" height=\"369\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3635\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\" alt=\"Lunch 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"321\" /></a></p><p>After about seven minutes of this, I was able to get out my first question, a smalltalk-y question about how he thought the recent launch had gone (they had attempted an extremely difficult rocket-landing maneuver—more on that in the SpaceX post). His response included the following words: hypersonic, rarefied, densifying, supersonic, Mach 1, Mach 3, Mach 4, Mach 5, vacuum, regimes, thrusters, nitrogen, helium, mass, momentum, ballistic, and boost-back. While this was happening, I was still mostly blacked out from the surreality of the situation, and when I started to come to, I was scared to ask any questions about what he was saying in case he had already explained it while I was unconscious.</p><p>I eventually regained the ability to have adult human conversation, and we began what turned into a highly interesting and engaging two-hour discussion.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3623\" id=\"note-8-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> This guy has a lot on his mind across a <em>lot </em>of topics. In this one lunch alone, we covered electric cars, climate change, artificial intelligence, the Fermi Paradox, consciousness, reusable rockets, colonizing Mars, creating an atmosphere on Mars, voting on Mars, genetic programming, his kids, population decline, physics vs. engineering, Edison vs. Tesla, solar power, a carbon tax, the definition of a company, warping spacetime and how this isn’t actually something you can do, nanobots in your bloodstream and how this isn’t actually something you can do, Galileo, Shakespeare, the American forefathers, Henry Ford, Isaac Newton, satellites, and ice ages.</p><p>I’ll get into the specifics of what he had to say about many of these things in later posts, but some notes for now:</p><p>— He’s a pretty tall and burly dude. Doesn’t really come through on camera.</p><p>— He ordered a burger and ate it in either two or three bites over a span of about 15 seconds. I’ve never seen anything like it.</p><p>— <strong>He is very, <em>very </em>concerned about AI.</strong> I quoted him in my <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a> on AI saying that he fears that by working to bring about Superintelligent AI (ASI), we’re “summoning the demon,” but I didn’t know how <em>much</em> he thought about the topic. He cited AI safety as one of the <em>three </em>things he thinks about most—the other two being sustainable energy and becoming a multi-planet species, i.e. Tesla and SpaceX. Musk is a smart motherfucker, and he knows a ton about AI, and his sincere concern about this makes me scared.</p><p>— <strong>The Fermi Paradox also worries him.</strong> In <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">my post</a> on that, I divided Fermi thinkers into two camps—those who think there’s no other highly intelligent life out there at all because of some Great Filter, and those who believe there must be plenty of intelligent life and that we don’t see signs of any for some other reason. Musk wasn’t sure which camp seemed more likely, but he suspects that there may be an upsetting Great Filter situation going on. He thinks the paradox “just doesn’t make sense” and that it “gets more and more worrying” the more time that goes by. Considering the possibility that maybe we’re a rare civilization who made it past the Great Filter through a freak occurrence makes him feel even more conviction about SpaceX’s mission: “If we are very rare, we better get to the multi-planet situation <em>fast</em>, because if civilization is tenuous, then we must do whatever we can to ensure that our already-weak probability of surviving is improved dramatically.” Again, his fear here makes me feel not great.</p><p>— <strong>One topic I disagreed with him on is the nature of consciousness.</strong> I think of consciousness as a smooth <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">spectrum</a>. To me, what we experience as consciousness is just what it feels like to be human-level intelligent. We’re smarter, and “more conscious” than an ape, who is more conscious than a chicken, etc. And an alien much smarter than us would be to us as we are to an ape (or an ant) in every way. We talked about this, and Musk seemed convinced that human-level consciousness is a black-and-white thing—that it’s like a switch that flips on at some point in the evolutionary process and that no other animals share. He doesn’t buy the “ants : humans :: humans : [a much smarter extra-terrestrial]” thing, believing that humans are weak computers and that something smarter than humans would just be a stronger computer, not something so beyond us we couldn’t even fathom its existence.</p><p>— <strong>I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming.</strong> He doesn’t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: “The whole system is collapsing. You don’t see someone who’s 90 years old and it’s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The <em>whole system</em> is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.” Now with anyone else—literally <em>anyone</em> else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk <em>fixes shit for humanity.</em> So what did I do?</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>Well…but isn’t this important enough to try? Is this something you’d ever turn your attention to?</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>You’re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.</p><p><strong>Elon:</strong> You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it’s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don’t know.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>I think there’s a way. You’ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that’s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it’s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>I mean I do think there’s…in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That’s the only way to do it.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>[Nods, then pauses as he looks over my shoulder in a daze] It’s software.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) It’s really funny to brashly pressure Elon Musk to take on yet another seemingly-insurmountable task and to act a little disappointed in him that he’s not currently doing it, when he’s already doing more for humanity than literally anyone on the planet.</p><p>2) It’s also super fun to casually brush off the moral issues around genetic programming with “I think there’s a way” and to refer to <em>DNA—</em>literally the smallest and most complex substance ever—as “just a physical material deep down” when I have absolutely no idea what I’m talking about. Because those things will be his problem to figure out, not mine.</p><p>3) I think I’ve successfully planted the seed. If Musk takes on human genetics 15 years from now and we all end up living to 250 because of it, you all owe me a drink.</p><address style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</address><p>Watching interviews with Musk, you see a lot of people ask him some variation of this question Chris Anderson <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity#t-1088953\" target=\"_blank\">asked him</a> on stage at the 2013 TED conference:</p><p><em>How have you done this? These projects—PayPal, SolarCity, Tesla, SpaceX—they’re so spectacularly different. They’re such ambitious projects, at scale. How on Earth has one person been able to innovate in this way—what is it about you? Can we have some of that secret sauce?</em></p><p>There are a lot of things about Musk that make him so successful, but I do think there’s a “secret sauce” that puts Musk in a different league from even the other renowned billionaires of our time. I have a theory about what that is, which has to do with the way Musk thinks, the way that he reasons through problems, and the way he views the world. As this series continues, think about this, and we’ll discuss a lot more in the last post.</p><p>For now, I’ll leave you with Elon Musk holding a <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Panic Monster</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6470.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3641\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6470.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6470\" width=\"300\" height=\"456\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>If you’re into Wait But Why, sign up for the <strong><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/Ffj9D\" target=\"_blank\">Wait But Why email list</a></strong> and we’ll send you the new posts right when they come out.

Not just because Elon Musk is Elon Musk, but because here are two <em>separate </em>items that have been sitting for a while in my &#8220;Future Post Topics&#8221; document, verbatim:</p><p>&#8211; &#8220;electric vs hybrid vs gas cars, deal with tesla, sustainable energy&#8221;</p><p>&#8211; &#8220;spacex, musk, mars?? how learn to do rockets??&#8221;</p><p>I already wanted to write about these topics, for the same reason I <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">wrote about</a> Artificial Intelligence—I knew they would be hugely important in the future but that I also didn&#8217;t understand them well enough. And Musk is leading a revolution in both of these worlds.</p><p>It would be like if you had plans to write about the process of throwing lightning bolts and then one day out of the blue Zeus called and asked if you wanted to question him about a lot of stuff.</p><p>So it was on. The plan was that I&#8217;d come out to California, see the Tesla and SpaceX factories, meet with some of the engineers at each company, and have an extended sit down with Musk. <em>Exciting.</em></p><p>The first order of business was to have a full panic. I needed to not sit down with these people—these world-class engineers and rocket scientists—and know almost nothing about anything. I had a lot of quick learning to do.</p><p>The problem with Elon Fucking Musk, though, is that he happens to be involved in <em>all </em>of the following industries:</p><ul><li>Automotive</li><li>Aerospace</li><li>Solar Energy</li><li>Energy Storage</li><li>Satellite</li><li>High-Speed Ground Transportation</li><li>And, um, Multi-Planetary Expansion</li></ul><p>Zeus would have been less stressful.</p><p>So I spent the two weeks leading up to the West Coast visit reading and reading and reading, and it became quickly clear that this was gonna need to be a multi-post series. There&#8217;s a <em>lot </em>to get into.</p><p>We&#8217;ll dive deep into Musk&#8217;s companies and the industries surrounding them in the coming posts, but today, let&#8217;s start by going over exactly who this dude is and why he&#8217;s such a big deal.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3623\" id=\"note-1-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-2-3623\" id=\"note2-2-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><sup>← <span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">click these</span></sup></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The Making of Elon Musk</strong></span></p><p><em>Note: There&#8217;s a great biography on Musk coming out May 19th, written by tech writer Ashlee Vance. I was able to get an advance copy, and it&#8217;s been a key source in putting together these posts. I&#8217;m going to keep to a brief overview of his life here—if you want the full story, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062301233/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062301233&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=UMV6CN256IWSDQDR\" target=\"_blank\">get the bio</a>.</em></p><p>Musk was born in 1971 in South Africa. Childhood wasn&#8217;t a great time for him—he had a tough family life and never fit in well at school.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3623\" id=\"note-2-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> But, like you often read in the bios of extraordinary people, he was an avid self-learner early on. His brother Kimbal has said Elon would often read for 10 hours a day—a lot of science fiction and eventually, a lot of non-fiction too. By fourth grade, he was constantly buried in the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica. </i></p><p>One thing you&#8217;ll learn about Musk as you read these posts is that he thinks of humans as computers, which, in their most literal sense, they are. A human&#8217;s hardware is his physical body and brain. His software is the way he learns to think, his value system, his habits, his personality. And learning, for Musk, is simply the process of &#8220;downloading data and algorithms into your brain.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3623\" id=\"note2-3-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> Among his many frustrations with formal classroom learning is the &#8220;ridiculously slow download speed&#8221; of sitting in a classroom while a teacher explains something, and to this day, most of what he knows he&#8217;s learned through reading.</p><p>He became consumed with a second fixation at the age of nine when he got his hands on his first computer, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore VIC-20</a>. It came with five kilobytes of memory and a &#8220;how to program&#8221; guide that was intended to take the user six months to complete. Nine-year-old Elon finished it in three days. At 12, he used his skills to create a video game called Blastar, which he told me was &#8220;a trivial game&#8230;but better than Flappy Bird.&#8221; But in 1983, it was good enough to be sold to a computer magazine for $500 ($1,200 in today&#8217;s money)—not bad for a 12-year-old.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3623\" id=\"note-3-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p>Musk never felt much of a connection to South Africa—he didn&#8217;t fit in with the jockish, white Afrikaner culture, and it was a nightmare country for a potential entrepreneur. He saw Silicon Valley as the Promised Land, and at the age of 17, he left South Africa forever. He started out in Canada, which was an easier place to immigrate to because his mom is a Canadian citizen, and a few years later, used a college transfer to the University of Pennsylvania as a way into the US.<a href=\"#footnote-4-3623\" id=\"note-4-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><p>In college, he thought about what he wanted to do with his life, using as his starting point the question, &#8220;What will most affect the future of humanity?&#8221; The answer he came up with was a list of five things: &#8220;the internet; sustainable energy; space exploration, in particular the permanent extension of life beyond Earth; artificial intelligence; and reprogramming the human genetic code.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3623\" id=\"note2-4-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p>He was iffy about how positive the impact of the latter two would be, and though he was optimistic about each of the first three, he never considered at the time that he&#8217;d ever be involved in space exploration. That left the internet and sustainable energy as his options.</p><p>He decided to go with sustainable energy. After finishing college, he enrolled in a Stanford PhD program to study high energy density capacitors, a technology aimed at coming up with a more efficient way than traditional batteries to store energy—which he knew could be key to a sustainable energy future and help accelerate the advent of an electric car industry.</p><p>But two days into the program, he got massive FOMO because it was 1995 and he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t stand to just watch the internet go by—[he] wanted to jump in and make it better.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3623\" id=\"note2-5-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a> So he dropped out and decided to try the internet instead.</p><p>His first move was to go try to get a job at the monster of the 1995 internet, Netscape. The tactic he came up with was to walk into the lobby, uninvited, stand there awkwardly, be too shy to talk to anyone, and walk out.</p><p>Musk bounced back from the unimpressive career beginning by teaming up with his brother Kimbal (who had followed Elon to the US) to start their own company—Zip2. Zip2 was like a primitive combination of Yelp and Google Maps, far before anything like either of those existed. The goal was to get businesses to realize that being in the Yellow Pages would become outdated at some point and that it was a good idea to get themselves into an online directory. The brothers had no money, slept in the office and showered at the YMCA, and Elon, their lead programmer, sat obsessively at his computer working around the clock. In 1995, it was hard to convince businesses that the internet was important—many told them that advertising on the internet sounded like &#8220;the dumbest thing they had ever heard of&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3623\" id=\"note2-6-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a>—but eventually, they began to rack up customers and the company grew. It was the heat of the 90s internet boom, startup companies were being snatched up left and right, and in 1999, Compaq snatched up Zip2 for $307 million. Musk, who was 27, made off with $22 million.</p><p>In what would become a recurring theme for Musk, he finished one venture and immediately dove into a new, harder, more complex one. If he were following the dot-com millionaire rulebook, he&#8217;d have known that what you&#8217;re supposed to do after hitting it big during the 90s boom is either retire off into the sunset of leisure and angel investing, or if you still have ambition, start a new company with someone else&#8217;s money. But Musk doesn&#8217;t tend to follow normal rulebooks, and he plunged three quarters of his net worth into his new idea, an outrageously bold plan to build essentially an online bank—replete with checking, savings, and brokerage accounts—called X.com. This seems less insane now, but in 1999, an internet startup trying to compete with the large banks was unheard of.</p><p>In the same building that X.com worked out of was another internet finance company called Confinity, founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin. One of X.com&#8217;s many features was an easy money-transfer service, and later, Confinity would develop a similar service. Both companies began to notice a strong demand for their money-transfer service, which put the two companies in sudden furious competition with each other, and they finally decided to just merge into what we know today as PayPal.</p><p>This brought together a lot of egos and conflicting opinions—Musk was now joined by Peter Thiel and a bunch of other now-super-successful internet guys—and despite the company growing rapidly, things inside the office did not go smoothly. The conflicts boiled over in late 2000, and when Musk was on a half fundraising trip / half honeymoon (with his first wife Justine), the anti-Musk crowd staged a coup and replaced him as CEO with Thiel. Musk handled this surprisingly well, and to this day, he says he doesn&#8217;t agree with that decision but he understands why they did it. He stayed on the team in a senior role, continued investing in the company, and played an instrumental role in selling the company to eBay in 2002, for $1.5 billion. Musk, the company&#8217;s largest shareholder, walked away with $180 million (after taxes).<a href=\"#footnote-5-3623\" id=\"note-5-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><p>If there was ever a semblance of the normal life rulebook in Musk&#8217;s decision-making, it was at this point in his life—as a beyond-wealthy 31-year-old in 2002—that he dropped the rulebook into the fire for good.</p><p>The subject of what he did over the next 13 years leading up to today is what we&#8217;ll thoroughly explore over the rest of this series. For now, here&#8217;s the short story:</p><p>In 2002, before the sale of PayPal even went through, Musk starting voraciously reading about rocket technology, and later that year, with $100 million, he started one of the most unthinkable and ill-advised ventures of all time: a rocket company called SpaceX, whose stated purpose was to revolutionize the cost of space travel in order to make humans a multi-planetary species by colonizing Mars with at least a million people over the next century.</p><p>Mm hm.</p><p>Then, in 2004, as that &#8220;project&#8221; was just getting going, Musk decided to multi-task by launching the second-most unthinkable and ill-advised venture of all time: an electric car company called Tesla, whose stated purpose was to revolutionize the worldwide car industry by significantly accelerating the advent of a mostly-electric-car world—in order to bring humanity on a huge leap toward a sustainable energy future. Musk funded this one personally as well, pouring in $70 million, despite the tiny fact that the last time a US car startup succeeded was Chrysler in 1925, and the last time someone<em> </em>started a successful <em>electric</em> car startup was never.</p><p>And since why the fuck not, a couple years later, in 2006, he threw in $10 million to found, with his cousins, <em>another </em>company, called SolarCity, whose goal was to revolutionize energy production by creating a large, distributed utility that would install solar panel systems on millions of people&#8217;s homes, dramatically reducing their consumption of fossil fuel-generated electricity and ultimately &#8220;accelerating mass adoption of sustainable energy.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3623\" id=\"note2-7-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p>If you were observing all of this in those four years following the PayPal sale, you&#8217;d think it was a sad story. A delusional internet millionaire, comically in over his head with a slew of impossible projects, doing everything he could to squander his fortune.</p><p>By 2008, this seemed to be playing out, to the letter. SpaceX had figured out how to build rockets, just not rockets that actually worked—it had attempted three launches so far and all three had blown up before reaching orbit. In order to bring in any serious outside investment or payload contracts, SpaceX had to show that they could successfully launch a rocket—but Musk said he had funds left for one and only one more launch. If the fourth launch also failed, SpaceX would be done.</p><p>Meanwhile, up in the Bay Area, Tesla was also in the shit. They had yet to deliver their first car—the Tesla Roadster—to the market, which didn&#8217;t look good to the outside world. Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag made the Tesla Roadster its #1 tech company fail of 2007. This would have been more okay if the global economy hadn&#8217;t suddenly crashed, hitting the automotive industry the absolute hardest and sucking dry any flow of investments into car companies, especially new and unproven ones. And Tesla was running out of money fast.</p><p>During this double implosion of his career, the one thing that held stable and strong in Musk&#8217;s life was his marriage of eight years, if by stable and strong you mean falling apart entirely in a soul-crushing, messy divorce.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the thing—Musk is not a fool, and he hadn&#8217;t built bad companies. He had built very, <em>very </em>good companies. It&#8217;s just that creating a reliable rocket is unfathomably difficult, as is launching a startup car company, and because no one wanted to invest in what seemed to the outside world like overambitious and probably-doomed ventures—especially during a recession—Musk had to rely on his own personal funds. PayPal made him rich, but not rich enough to keep these companies afloat for very long on his own. Without outside money, both SpaceX and Tesla had a short runway. So it&#8217;s not that SpaceX and Tesla were bad—it&#8217;s that they needed more time to succeed, and they were out of time.</p><p>And then, in the most dire hour, everything turned around.</p><p>First, in September of 2008, SpaceX launched their fourth rocket—and their last one if it didn&#8217;t successfully put a payload into orbit—and it succeeded. Perfectly.</p><p>That was enough for NASA to say &#8220;fuck it, let&#8217;s give this Musk guy a try,&#8221; and it took a gamble, offering SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to carry out 12 launches for the agency. Runway extended. SpaceX saved.</p><p><em>The next day,</em> on Christmas Eve 2008, when Musk scrounged up the last money he could manage to keep Tesla going, Tesla&#8217;s investors reluctantly agreed to match his investment. Runway extended. Five months later, things began looking up, and another critical investment came in—$50 million from Daimler. Tesla saved.</p><p>While 2008 hardly marked the end of the bumps in the road for Musk, the overarching story of the next seven years would be the soaring, earthshaking success of Elon Musk and his companies.</p><p>Since their first three failed launches, SpaceX has launched 20 times—all successes. NASA is now a regular client, and one of many, since the innovations at SpaceX have allowed companies to launch things to space for the lowest cost in history. Within those 20 launches have been all kinds of &#8220;firsts&#8221; for a commercial rocket company—to this day, the four entities in history who have managed to launch a spacecraft into orbit and successfully return it to Earth are the US, Russia, China—and SpaceX. SpaceX is currently testing their new spacecraft, which will bring humans to space, and they&#8217;re busy at work on the much larger rocket that will be able to bring 100 people to Mars at once. A recent investment by Google and Fidelity has valued the company at $12 billion.</p><p>Tesla&#8217;s Model S has become a smashing success, blowing away the automotive industry with the highest ever Consumer Reports rating of a 99/100, and the highest safety rating in history from the National Highway Safety Administration, a 5.4/5. Now they&#8217;re getting closer and closer to releasing their true disruptor—the much more affordable Model 3—and the company&#8217;s market cap is just under $30 billion. They&#8217;re also becoming the world&#8217;s most formidable battery company, currently working on their giant Nevada &#8220;Gigafactory,&#8221; which will more than double the world&#8217;s <em>total </em>annual production of lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>SolarCity, which went public in 2012, now has a market cap of just under $6 billion and has become the largest installer of solar panels in the US. They&#8217;re now building the country&#8217;s largest solar panel-manufacturing factory in Buffalo, and they&#8217;ll likely be entering into a partnership with Tesla to package their product with Tesla&#8217;s new home battery, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVjW9XdPlhg\" target=\"_blank\">Powerwall</a>.</p><p>And since that&#8217;s not enough, in his spare time, Musk is pushing the development a whole new mode of transport—the <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperloop</a>.</p><p>In a couple of years, when their newest factories are complete, Musk&#8217;s three companies will employ over 30,000 people. After nearly going broke in 2008 and telling a friend that he and his wife may have to &#8220;move into his wife&#8217;s parents&#8217; basement,&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3623\" id=\"note2-8-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a> Musk&#8217;s current net worth <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">clocks in</a> at $12.9 billion.</p><p>All of this has made Musk somewhat of a living legend. In building a successful automotive startup and its worldwide network of Supercharger stations, Musk has been compared to visionary industrialists like Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. The pioneering work of SpaceX on rocket technology has led to comparisons to Howard Hughes, and many have drawn parallels between Musk and Thomas Edison because of the advancements in engineering Musk has been able to achieve across industries. Perhaps most often, he&#8217;s compared to Steve Jobs, for his remarkable ability to disrupt giant, long-stagnant industries with things customers didn&#8217;t even know they wanted. Some believe he&#8217;ll be remembered in a class of his own. Tech writer and Musk biographer Ashlee Vance has suggested that what Musk is building &#8220;has the potential to be much grander than anything Hughes or Jobs produced. Musk has taken industries like aerospace and automotive that America seemed to have given up on and recast them as something new and fantastic.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3623\" id=\"note2-9-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/F.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-3657\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/F.jpg\" alt=\"F\" width=\"219\" height=\"148\" /></a>Chris Anderson, who runs TED Talks, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUMZTtQU10o\" target=\"_blank\">calls</a> Musk &#8220;the world&#8217;s most remarkable living entrepreneur.&#8221; Others know him as &#8220;the real life Iron Man,&#8221; and not for no reason—Jon Favreau actually sent Robert Downey, Jr. to spend time with Musk in the SpaceX factory prior to filming the first <em>Iron Man</em> movie so he could model his character off of Musk.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3623\" id=\"note2-10-3623\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a> He&#8217;s even <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Musk_Who_Fell_to_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">been on</a> The Simpsons.</p><p>And this is the man I was somehow on the phone with as I frantically paced back and forth in my apartment, in pajama pants.</p><p>On the call, he made it clear that he wasn&#8217;t looking for me to advertise his companies—he only wanted me to help explain what&#8217;s going on in the worlds surrounding those companies and why the things happening with electric cars, sustainable energy production, and aerospace matter so much.</p><p>He seemed particularly bored with people spending time writing about <em>him—</em>he feels there are so many things of critical importance going on in the industries he&#8217;s involved in, and every time someone writes about him, he wishes they were writing about fossil fuel supply or battery advancements or the importance of making humanity multi-planetary (this is especially clear in the intro to the upcoming biography on him, when the author explains how <em>not</em> interested Musk was in having a bio written about him).</p><p>So I&#8217;m sure this first post, whose title is &#8220;Elon Musk: The World&#8217;s Raddest Man,&#8221; will annoy him.</p><p>But I have reasons. To me, there are two worthy areas of exploration in this post series:</p><p><strong>1) To understand why Musk is doing what he&#8217;s doing.</strong> He deeply believes that he&#8217;s taken on the most pressing possible causes to give humanity the best chance of a good future. I want to explore those causes in depth and the reasons he&#8217;s so concerned about them.</p><p><strong>2) To understand why Musk is <em>able to </em>do what he&#8217;s doing. </strong>There are a few people in each generation who dramatically change the world, and those people are worth studying. They do things differently from everyone else—and I think there&#8217;s a lot to learn from them.</p><p>So on my visit to California, I had two goals in mind: to understand as best I could what Musk and his teams were working on so feverishly and why it mattered so much, and to try to gain insight into what it is that makes him so capable of changing the world.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Visiting the Factories</strong></span></p><p>The Tesla Factory (in Northern CA) and the SpaceX Factory (in Southern CA), in addition to both being huge, and rad, have a lot in common.</p><p>Both factories are bright and clean, shiny and painted white, with super high ceilings. Both feel more like laboratories than traditional factories. And in both places, the engineers doing white collar jobs and the technicians doing blue collar jobs are deliberately placed in the same working quarters so they&#8217;ll work closely together and give each other feedback—and Musk believes it&#8217;s crucial for those designing the machines to be around those machines as they&#8217;re being manufactured. And while a traditional factory environment wouldn&#8217;t be ideal for an engineer on a computer and a traditional office environment wouldn&#8217;t be a good workplace for a technician, a clean, futuristic laboratory feels right for both professions. There are almost no closed offices in either factory—everyone is out in the open, exposed to everyone else.</p><p>When I pulled up to the Tesla factory (joined by Andrew), I was first taken by its size—and when I looked it up, I wasn&#8217;t surprised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_buildings_in_the_world\" target=\"_blank\">to see</a> that it has the second largest building footprint (aka base area) in the world.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6427.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3645\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6427.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6427\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" /></a></p><p>The factory was formerly jointly owned by GM and Toyota, who sold it to Tesla in 2010. We started off the day with a full tour of the factory—a sea of red robots making cars and being silly:<a href=\"#footnote-6-3623\" id=\"note-6-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6434.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3646\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6434.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6434\" width=\"700\" height=\"261\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6439.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3647\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6439.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6439\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6444.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3648\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_6444.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6444\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p>And other cool things, like a vast section of the factory that just makes the car battery, and another that houses the 20,000 pound rolls of aluminum they slice and press and weld into Teslas.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/130.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3643\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/130.jpg\" alt=\"130\" width=\"600\" height=\"379\" /></a></p><p>And this giant press, which costs $50 million and presses metal with <em>4,500 tons </em>of pressure (the same pressure you&#8217;d get if you stacked 2,500 cars on top of something).</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/142.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3644\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/142.jpg\" alt=\"142\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a></p><p>The Tesla factory is working on upping its output from 30,000 cars/year to 50,000, or about 1,000 per week. They seemed to be pumping out cars incredibly quickly, so I was blown away to learn that Toyota had been on a 1,000 cars per <em>day </em>clip when they inhabited the factory.</p><p>I had a chance to visit the Tesla design studio (no pictures allowed), where there were designers sketching car designs on computer screens and, on the other side of the room, full-size car models made of clay. An actual-size clay version of the upcoming Model 3 was surrounded by specialists sculpting it with tiny instruments and blades, shaving off fractions of a millimeter to examine the way light bounced off the curves. There was also a 3D printer that could quickly &#8220;print&#8221; out a shoe-sized 3D model of a sketched Tesla design so a designer could actually hold their design and look at it from different angles. Deliciously futuristic.</p><p>The next day was the SpaceX factory, which might be even cooler, but the building contains advanced rocket technology, which according to the government is &#8220;weapons technology,&#8221; and apparently random bloggers aren&#8217;t allowed to take pictures of weapons technology.</p><p>Anyway, after the tours, I had a chance to sit down with several senior engineers and designers at both companies. They&#8217;d explain that they were a foremost expert in their field, I&#8217;d explain that I had recently figured out how big the building would be that could hold all humans, and we&#8217;d begin our discussion. I&#8217;d ask them about their work, their thoughts on the company as a whole and the broader industry, and then I&#8217;d ask them about their relationship with Elon and what it was like to work for him. Without exception, they were really nice-seeming, friendly people, who all came off as ridiculously smart but in a non-pretentious way. Musk has said he has a strict &#8220;no assholes&#8221; hiring policy, and I could see that at work in these meetings.</p><p>So what&#8217;s Musk like as a boss?</p><p>Let&#8217;s start by seeing what the internet says—there&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-with-Elon-Musk\" target=\"_blank\">Quora thread</a> that poses the question: &#8220;What is it like to work with Elon Musk?&#8221;</p><p>The first answer is from a longtime SpaceX employee who no longer works there, who describes the day that their 3rd launch failed, a devastating blow for the company and for all the people who had worked for years to try to make it work.</p><p>She describes Elon emerging from mission command to address the company and delivering a rousing speech. She refers to Elon&#8217;s &#8220;infinite wisdom&#8221; and says, &#8220;I think most of us would have followed him into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil after that.  It was the most impressive display of leadership that I have ever witnessed.&#8221;</p><p>Right below that answer is another answer, from an anonymous SpaceX engineer, who describes working for Musk like this:</p><p>&#8220;You can always tell when someone&#8217;s left an Elon meeting: they&#8217;re defeated&#8230;nothing you ever do will be good enough so you have to find your own value, not depending on praise to get you through your obviously insufficient 80 hour work weeks.&#8221;</p><p>Reading about Musk online and in Vance&#8217;s book, I was struck by how representative both of these Quora comments were of whole camps of opinion on working for Musk. Doing so seems to bring out a tremendous amount of adoration and a tremendous amount of exasperation, sometimes with a tone of bitterness—and even more oddly, much of the time, you hear both sides of this story expressed by the same person. For example, later in the comment of the effusive Quora commenter comes &#8220;Working with him isn’t a comfortable experience, he is never satisfied with himself so he is never really satisfied with anyone around him&#8230;the challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t.&#8221; And the frustrated anonymous commenter later concedes that the way Elon is &#8220;is understandable&#8221; given the enormity of the task at hand, and that &#8220;it is a great company and I do love it.&#8221;</p><p>My own talks with Musk&#8217;s engineers and designers told a similar story. I was told: &#8220;Elon always wants to know, &#8216;Why are we not going faster?’ He always wants bigger, better, faster&#8221; by the same person who a few minutes later was emphasizing how fair and thoughtful Musk tends to be in handling the terms for a recently fired employee.</p><p>The same person who told me he has &#8220;lots of sleepless nights&#8221; said in the adjacent sentence how happy he is to be at the company and that he hopes to &#8220;never leave.&#8221;</p><p>One senior executive described interacting with Musk like this: “Any conversation’s fairly high stakes because he’ll be very opinionated, and he can go deeper than you expect or are prepared for or deeper than your knowledge goes on a given topic, and it does feel like a high wire act interacting with him, especially when you find yourself in a [gulp] technical disagreement.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote-7-3623\" id=\"note-7-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> The same executive, who had previously worked at a huge tech company, also called Musk &#8220;the most grounded billionaire I&#8217;ve ever worked with.&#8221;</p><p>What I began to understand is that the explanation for both sides of the story—the cult-like adulation right alongside the grudging willingness to endure what sounds like blatant hell—comes down to respect. The people who work for Musk, no matter how they feel about his management style, feel an immense amount of respect—for his intelligence, for his work ethic, for his guts, and for the gravity of the missions he&#8217;s undertaken, missions that make all other potential jobs seem trivial and pointless.</p><p>Many of the people I talked to also alluded to their respect for his integrity. One way this integrity comes through is in his consistency. He&#8217;s been saying the same things in interviews for a decade, often using the same exact phrasing many years apart. He says what he really means, no matter the situation—one employee close to Musk told me that after a press conference or a business negotiation, once in private he&#8217;d ask Musk what his real angle was and what he <em>really </em>thinks. Musk&#8217;s response would always be boring: &#8220;I think exactly what I said.&#8221;</p><p>A few people I spoke with referenced Musk&#8217;s obsession with truth and accuracy. He&#8217;s fine with and even welcoming of negative criticism about him when he believes it&#8217;s accurate, but when the press gets something wrong about him or his companies, he usually can&#8217;t help himself and will engage them and correct their error. He detests vague spin-doctor phrases like &#8220;studies say&#8221; and &#8220;scientists disagree,&#8221; and he refuses to advertise for Tesla, something most startup car companies wouldn&#8217;t think twice about—because he sees advertising as manipulative and dishonest.</p><p>There&#8217;s even an undertone of integrity in Musk&#8217;s tyrannical demands of workers, because while he may be a tyrant, he&#8217;s not a hypocrite. Employees pressured to work 80 hours a week tend to be less bitter about it when at least the CEO is in there working 100.</p><p>Speaking of the CEO, let&#8217;s go have a hamburger with him.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>My Lunch With Elon</strong></span></p><p>It started like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3634\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-1.png\" alt=\"Lunch 1\" width=\"480\" height=\"398\" /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3635\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\" alt=\"Lunch 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"321\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3636\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-3.png\" alt=\"Lunch 3\" width=\"481\" height=\"382\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-4.png\"><br /></a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3638\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-5.png\" alt=\"Lunch 5\" width=\"479\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3639\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-6.png\" alt=\"Lunch 6\" width=\"481\" height=\"369\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3635\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lunch-2.png\" alt=\"Lunch 2\" width=\"400\" height=\"321\" /></a></p><p>After about seven minutes of this, I was able to get out my first question, a smalltalk-y question about how he thought the recent launch had gone (they had attempted an extremely difficult rocket-landing maneuver—more on that in the SpaceX post). His response included the following words: hypersonic, rarefied, densifying, supersonic, Mach 1, Mach 3, Mach 4, Mach 5, vacuum, regimes, thrusters, nitrogen, helium, mass, momentum, ballistic, and boost-back. While this was happening, I was still mostly blacked out from the surreality of the situation, and when I started to come to, I was scared to ask any questions about what he was saying in case he had already explained it while I was unconscious.</p><p>I eventually regained the ability to have adult human conversation, and we began what turned into a highly interesting and engaging two-hour discussion.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3623\" id=\"note-8-3623\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> This guy has a lot on his mind across a <em>lot </em>of topics. In this one lunch alone, we covered electric cars, climate change, artificial intelligence, the Fermi Paradox, consciousness, reusable rockets, colonizing Mars, creating an atmosphere on Mars, voting on Mars, genetic programming, his kids, population decline, physics vs. engineering, Edison vs. Tesla, solar power, a carbon tax, the definition of a company, warping spacetime and how this isn&#8217;t actually something you can do, nanobots in your bloodstream and how this isn&#8217;t actually something you can do, Galileo, Shakespeare, the American forefathers, Henry Ford, Isaac Newton, satellites, and ice ages.</p><p>I&#8217;ll get into the specifics of what he had to say about many of these things in later posts, but some notes for now:</p><p>— He&#8217;s a pretty tall and burly dude. Doesn&#8217;t really come through on camera.</p><p>— He ordered a burger and ate it in either two or three bites over a span of about 15 seconds. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it.</p><p>— <strong>He is very, <em>very </em>concerned about AI.</strong> I quoted him in my <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a> on AI saying that he fears that by working to bring about Superintelligent AI (ASI), we&#8217;re &#8220;summoning the demon,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t know how <em>much</em> he thought about the topic. He cited AI safety as one of the <em>three </em>things he thinks about most—the other two being sustainable energy and becoming a multi-planet species, i.e. Tesla and SpaceX. Musk is a smart motherfucker, and he knows a ton about AI, and his sincere concern about this makes me scared.</p><p>— <strong>The Fermi Paradox also worries him.</strong> In <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">my post</a> on that, I divided Fermi thinkers into two camps—those who think there&#8217;s no other highly intelligent life out there at all because of some Great Filter, and those who believe there must be plenty of intelligent life and that we don&#8217;t see signs of any for some other reason. Musk wasn&#8217;t sure which camp seemed more likely, but he suspects that there may be an upsetting Great Filter situation going on. He thinks the paradox &#8220;just doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8221; and that it &#8220;gets more and more worrying&#8221; the more time that goes by. Considering the possibility that maybe we&#8217;re a rare civilization who made it past the Great Filter through a freak occurrence makes him feel even more conviction about SpaceX&#8217;s mission: &#8220;If we are very rare, we better get to the multi-planet situation <em>fast</em>, because if civilization is tenuous, then we must do whatever we can to ensure that our already-weak probability of surviving is improved dramatically.&#8221; Again, his fear here makes me feel not great.</p><p>— <strong>One topic I disagreed with him on is the nature of consciousness.</strong> I think of consciousness as a smooth <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">spectrum</a>. To me, what we experience as consciousness is just what it feels like to be human-level intelligent. We&#8217;re smarter, and &#8220;more conscious&#8221; than an ape, who is more conscious than a chicken, etc. And an alien much smarter than us would be to us as we are to an ape (or an ant) in every way. We talked about this, and Musk seemed convinced that human-level consciousness is a black-and-white thing—that it&#8217;s like a switch that flips on at some point in the evolutionary process and that no other animals share. He doesn&#8217;t buy the &#8220;ants : humans :: humans : [a much smarter extra-terrestrial]&#8221; thing, believing that humans are weak computers and that something smarter than humans would just be a stronger computer, not something so beyond us we couldn&#8217;t even fathom its existence.</p><p>— <strong>I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming.</strong> He doesn&#8217;t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: &#8220;The whole system is collapsing. You don&#8217;t see someone who&#8217;s 90 years old and it&#8217;s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The <em>whole system</em> is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.&#8221; Now with anyone else—literally <em>anyone</em> else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk <em>fixes shit for humanity.</em> So what did I do?</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>Well&#8230;but isn&#8217;t this important enough to try? Is this something you&#8217;d ever turn your attention to?</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>You&#8217;re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.</p><p><strong>Elon:</strong> You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it&#8217;s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don&#8217;t know.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>I think there&#8217;s a way. You&#8217;ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that&#8217;s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it&#8217;s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>I mean I do think there&#8217;s&#8230;in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That&#8217;s the only way to do it.</p><p><strong>Me: </strong>And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.</p><p><strong>Elon: </strong>[Nods, then pauses as he looks over my shoulder in a daze] It&#8217;s software.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) It&#8217;s really funny to brashly pressure Elon Musk to take on yet another seemingly-insurmountable task and to act a little disappointed in him that he&#8217;s not currently doing it, when he&#8217;s already doing more for humanity than literally anyone on the planet.</p><p>2) It&#8217;s also super fun to casually brush off the moral issues around genetic programming with &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a way&#8221; and to refer to <em>DNA—</em>literally the smallest and most complex substance ever—as &#8220;just a physical material deep down&#8221; when I have absolutely no idea what I&#8217;m talking about. Because those things will be his problem to figure out, not mine.</p><p>3) I think I&#8217;ve successfully planted the seed. If Musk takes on human genetics 15 years from now and we all end up living to 250 because of it, you all owe me a drink.</p><address style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</address><p>Watching interviews with Musk, you see a lot of people ask him some variation of this question Chris Anderson <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity#t-1088953\" target=\"_blank\">asked him</a> on stage at the 2013 TED conference:</p><p><em>How have you done this?

High school students are given all these lectures about “pacing yourself” on longer projects, and I proudly paced myself less than almost anyone I knew. I never missed a deadline, but I only did anything the night before it was due. I was a <em>procrastinator</em>.</p><p>Except I wasn’t. High school is full of regular deadlines and short-term projects, and even longterm projects had sub-deadlines that force pacing upon you. There were a <em>few </em>dire moments, but for the most part, I was just doing everything at the last minute because I knew I could probably still do well that way—so why not.</p><p>There was definitely an <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Gratification Monkey</a><a href=\"#footnote-1-3539\" id=\"note-1-3539\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> in my head, but he was cute more than anything.

College is not like high school. The assignments are big, with a lot of time between deadlines, and since you’re not a child anymore, classes don’t treat you like one—no one forces you to pace anything. As a Government major, most of my classes involved a couple papers, a midterm, and a final exam over a four-month stretch, which means most of the time, there were no hard deadlines anywhere on the horizon.</p><p>Without deadlines to occupy him, my Panic Monster, who can’t think too far ahead, began to spend a lot of time in hibernation. My Rational Decision-Maker, who never realized how much he had relied on the Panic Monster, began to have difficulties carrying out his plans.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3561\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading1.png\" alt=\"Reading1\" width=\"600\" height=\"344\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3562\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading2.png\" alt=\"Reading2\" width=\"600\" height=\"244\" /></a></p><p>The more the Panic Monster slept, the more confidence the monkey gained. The Rational Decision-Maker, the only member of the brain who sees the world clearly, was concerned—he knew that college assignments were a lot bigger than high school assignments, and that pacing was no longer something to scoff at, but a critical thing to do. He’d put his foot down about social commitments when a deadline began to draw closer, but that wouldn’t solve the problem.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3557\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie1.png\" alt=\"movie1\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3558\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie2.png\" alt=\"movie2\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3559\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie3.png\" alt=\"movie3\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /></a></p><p>The RDM would slip further into despair, and only the times when things reached their most dire would anything change.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3560\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper1.png\" alt=\"paper1\" width=\"350\" height=\"418\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3564\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper2.png\" alt=\"paper2\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3565\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper3.png\" alt=\"paper3\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3566\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper4.png\" alt=\"paper4\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p>It didn’t matter how obvious a decision seemed to the RDM, it was becoming clear that he was totally unable to control the monkey without the Panic Monster’s help.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3544\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension1.png\" alt=\"extension1\" width=\"350\" height=\"370\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3545\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension2.png\" alt=\"extension2\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3546\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension3.png\" alt=\"extension3\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3547\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension4.png\" alt=\"extension4\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3548\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension5.png\" alt=\"extension5\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p>While college was often a disheartening experience for my RDM, it was a full renaissance for my Instant Gratification Monkey, who explored a wide range of activities in an effort to find himself. With a Yamaha electric keyboard right next to my desk, the monkey became increasingly passionate about playing the piano. It almost seemed like the times my RDM was stomping his foot the hardest about getting to work were the exact moments the monkey would feel the most spirited about putting on the headphones and becoming lost for hours in the piano.</p><p>When college ended, thrilled to be done forever with formal education, which was clearly not my thing, I burst out into the world with 1,000 ambitions to do 1,000 things. Just wait till the world saw me. I had everything imaginable to offer except knowledge, skills, and work ethic.</p><p>My RDM had done a lot of thinking about this, and he understood that the monkey had spent college trying to tell him something important—I wanted to be a <em>composer</em>. That was clearly the thing I was most drawn to, and finally, it would become the thing I was <em>supposed </em>to do each day. No more fighting the monkey—he was going to get exactly what he wanted. I had figured out life, and I moved to LA to write movie scores.</p><p>In order to pay my bills, I began tutoring kids after school on their homework or for the SAT, a side job I chose because it wouldn’t distract me from becoming the next John Williams. It was the perfect setup, I was brimming with excitement about music, and things were starting to move—when the weirdest thing happened. Just when I was sure I had found myself, the monkey began soul searching. When the RDM and I would sit down at the piano to write something—the exact activity the monkey spent college <em>obsessed </em>with—the monkey would throw a fit and refuse to join us. The RDM began to feel helpless, the same way he did in college.</p><p>Meanwhile, the monkey had found a new interest—he had become fixated with my <i>side job</i>. Tutoring was going well, referrals were increasing, and while the RDM would insist that we were already working with too many students, the monkey would accept every new job that came our way. Soon, the monkey started thinking bigger, and without running it by the rest of us, he began hiring my friends to tutor for me. The RDM would wake up eager to dive into composing, but the whole day would end up being spent on phone calls and buried in spreadsheets. The monkey had started a business.</p><p>My brain and I ended up in an unpleasant no-man’s land. The monkey refused to let us pour ourselves into our music career, and the RDM refused to embrace the monkey’s new business career. I was doing a lot of things and not giving my all to any of them.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spread-thin.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3563\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spread-thin.png\" alt=\"spread thin\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>It was around then that my best friend Andrew moved to LA. Andrew isn’t like me. He lives and breathes business, with no interest in pursuing anything in the arts, and ever since I met him when we were five, his monkey has been a tame little bitch who does what he’s told. After he moved, we started talking about maybe going into business together somehow. My RDM had refused to entertain taking business seriously until then, but the prospect of starting a company with Andrew and actually putting a full effort into it was enticing—and the monkey was clearly into it, so maybe <em>this</em> was the thing I was supposed to be doing all along. I decided to dive in, and building off of what I had started, we founded a new tutoring company together.</p><p>The RDM still wrestled with the decision to put a pause on the music side of things, but the company was growing quickly, being in business with Andrew was a great time—like playing a complex strategy game with your friend—and the RDM finally started to feel okay about becoming totally wrapped up in business.</p><p>Which was the monkey’s cue to become an avid blogger.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monkey-blog.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3556\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monkey-blog.png\" alt=\"monkey blog\" width=\"629\" height=\"386\" /></a></p><p>I had been casually blogging for a few years at that point, but business taking off was just what the monkey needed to kick his new writing hobby into full gear, and over the next few years, I wrote hundreds of blog posts in my off hours. I went into work every day, and I’d be engaged while I was there—but instead of doing what an entrepreneur is supposed to do outside of work and keep the wheels turning, mulling over the strategy and allowing the subconscious to drop key epiphanies on you from time to time, I’d be thinking about what to blog about next.</p><p>In 2013, when Andrew and I decided to start something new, we looked at my monkey, saw how absorbed he always was with his blog, and thought maybe <em>that</em> was the thing I was supposed to be doing this whole time—so we started Wait But Why. Andrew would continue to grow our company while I’d fully immerse myself in this new project, giving the monkey exactly what he so badly wanted.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What was classic procrastination in college morphed into a bizarre form of insanity once I entered the real world. On a day-to-day, micro level, there was still always an element of the normal “RDM tries to do something, monkey makes it difficult” thing, but in a broader, macro sense, it was almost as if I were <em>chasing </em>the monkey. After he defeated me so soundly in college, I wondered if fighting against him in the first place was my mistake. He’s born from some inner, primal part of me, so wouldn’t it make sense to pay attention to his inclinations and use <em>them </em>as my guide?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So that’s what I tried to do—when he’d be continually drawn to something, I’d eventually take his lead and build my life around that. But the problem was, he was almost like a mirage—once I’d get to where he was, he wouldn’t be there anymore. He’d be somewhere else. This was confusing—was he there before because he actually wanted to be, or was he just there because it was where the RDM was <em>not</em>? Did he actually have passions of his own, or was he just some elusive evil contrarian inside of me with a mission to hold me back from ever doing anything great with my talents and energies?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last year, I came across a little diagram that I think holds the key to these questions. It’s called the Eisenhower Matrix:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3577\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Eisenhower Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Eisenhower Matrix places anything you could spend your time doing on two spectrums: one going from the most urgent possible task to the least urgent, the other going from critically important to totally inconsequential—and using these as axes, divides your world into four quadrants.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The matrix was popularized in Stephen Covey’s famous book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451639619/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1451639619&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=NWOAUWNGA6LU6OH3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a> and is named after President Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower was well-known for being tremendously productive, which Covey credits to his “first things first” attitude on how to spend your time. And to Eisenhower, the “first things” were always the <em>important </em>ones. He believed you should spend nearly all of your time in Quadrants 1 and 2, and he accomplished this with a simple D-word for each quadrant:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix-Actions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3576\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix-Actions.png\" alt=\"Eisenhower Matrix Actions\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that’s fantastic for Dwight fucking Eisenhower. But you know what Dwight clearly didn’t have in his bald head? An all-powerful Instant Gratification Monkey. If he had, he’d know that a procrastinator’s matrix looks like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Procrastinators-Matrix1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3582\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Procrastinators-Matrix1.png\" alt=\"Procrastinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you ever want any information on Quadrant 4—directions, places to eat, etc.—just ask a procrastinator. They live there. For a non-procrastinator, Q4 is a happy place to spend time. After a productive day working on important tasks, it feels great to kick back in Q4—and under those circumstances, there’s a name for Q4: <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Happy Playground</a>. But procrastinators don’t tend to hang out in Q4 after an efficient day of high-level work—they’re there far more often than that, against their will, because the monkey has dragged them there, all while the Rational Decision-Maker is <em>begging </em>them to leave. And they have a different name for Q4: <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Dark Playground</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As for Quadrants 1 and 3—the <em>urgent </em>quadrants—most procrastinators will end up there from time to time, usually in a full sweat, with the Panic Monster next to their face screaming. Q1 and Q3 keep the procrastinator off the streets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And then there’s Quadrant 2. To a procrastinator, Quadrant 2 is a strange and foreign land, far, far away. Kind of like Atlantis, or Narnia. He knows it’s an important place, and he’s tried many times to go there, but there’s a big problem—the monkey is repulsed by it, and the Panic Monster isn’t concerned with it. And that’s the deadly combo that defeats the procrastinator every time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reason this is disastrous is that the road to the procrastinator’s dreams—the road to expanding his horizons, exploring his true potential, and achieving work he’s truly proud of—runs directly through Quadrant 2. Q1 and Q3 may be where people survive, but Q2 is where people thrive, grow, and blossom.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But if you’re a procrastinator, you’re in luck. You have an ace up your sleeve—someone daring and fearless, with bountiful energy and dynamic talent, and someone who can defeat the monkey like stepping on an ant: Future You.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Future You is a procrastinator’s most important ally—someone who’s always there and always has your back, no matter what. I know all about this firsthand. Future Tim is an amazing guy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When my alarm goes off and I don’t want to wake up, I just press the snooze button, which doles out the job of getting out of bed to Future Tim instead. My to-do list has two parts—a short, easy one for me, and a long one, full of all the things I can’t imagine ever doing, because they’re so icky-seeming. Future Tim always handles that one, without a complaint. Future Tim also has no problem with even the vilest of social obligations. I was recently invited to attend a feedback-giving session for a three-hour-long play written by someone I barely know—I certainly had no intention of ever doing that, but I would also have felt guilty just saying no, so I explained that I have a busy couple months, but that I’d be more than happy to join when it happens again this summer, a time when it’ll be Future Tim’s problem, not mine.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Future Tim also has a discipline and balance to his lifestyle I could only ever dream of. I’ve never been much of an exerciser—but Future Tim belongs to a gym and does all the jogging for both of us, and I love how into cooking healthy meals Future Tim is, because I personally don’t have the time. Future Tim is the kind of guy we all want to be like—I suggest getting to know him yourself, which you can do by buying his books, since he’s a prolific author.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But the most important role Future Tim plays in my life brings us back to the Eisenhower Matrix. In a convenient stroke of fate, Future Tim happens to spend almost all of his time in the one place I can never seem to get to myself: the all-important Quadrant 2. Future Tim is Quadrant 2’s warden, and when I make a list of important to-do items and notice that most of them seem to land in Q2, I don’t have to despair, because I know Future Tim is on top of them. Which is good, considering how dire a situation Past Tim, that useless fuck, has often left me in:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FT1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3569\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FT1.png\" alt=\"FT\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But for all of Future Tim’s virtues, he has one fatal flaw that kind of ruins everything: he doesn’t exist.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It turns out that Future You is as much of a mirage as the monkey’s passion for a hobby. I banked on Future Tim’s real-world existence for my most important plans, but every time I’d finally arrive at a time when I thought I would find Future Tim, he was nowhere to be found—the only person there would be stupid Present Tim. That’s the thing that really sucks about Future You—whenever time finally gets to him, he’s not Future You anymore, he’s Present You, and Present You can’t do the tasks you assigned to Future You because those tasks can only be done by someone without a monkey. You assigned them to Future You in the first place because he doesn’t <em>have</em> a monkey—that was the whole point. So you do what you always do—you re-delegate them to Future You, hoping that next time time catches up with Future You, he actually exists.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is what left me unable, for years, to give life my full effort. The important work to be done usually lives in Q2, a place I had a hard time going to, so I’d direct the extra energy to a passionate hobby instead. The monkey would get super into these hobbies, because hobbies are, by definition, in Q4—a place the monkey loves to be.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So here’s what went on when I was supposed to be pursuing a composing career:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Composer-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3575\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Composer-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Composer Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And when I decided to “follow the monkey’s lead” and take on business, I was missing the key point: “taking on” business meant making business the thing I was <em>supposed to do</em>, which turned it from a <em>not important </em>task into an <em>important </em>one—moving “business” from Q4, the monkey’s favorite place, to Q2, his least favorite place.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3574\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Business Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fact that I expected the monkey to remain obsessed with business after the switch to Q2 shows how little I understood the monkey. The monkey’s passion never was music, or business, or blogging—the monkey’s passion was always Q4.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the thing the monkey <em>really </em>likes about Q4 isn’t anything about Q4 in particular—it’s that <em>Quadrant 4 isn’t Quadrant 1 or 2.</em> The monkey, whose core drive is to do whatever’s <em>easiest</em>, can’t stand the “important” quadrants, because the important quadrants are where the pressure’s on—it’s where there’s something to prove, where your actions have consequences, where the stakes are high, and where you’re shooting for the stars, <em>which means you might fail to reach them. </em>No fucking thanks, says the monkey. Writing 300 blog posts while I was supposed to be dreaming up brilliant business growth strategies wasn’t “easy” in the sense that I didn’t have to work hard to write them—it was easy in that there was nothing at stake. Stakes are really what’s hard for a human.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I started writing posts for Wait But Why, I knew I wanted to write about procrastination. I needed to try to articulate the madness that went on in my head. After assigning that daunting mission to Future Tim for a while, I finally bit the bullet and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">did it</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reaction was overwhelming. In addition to the over 1,300 comments on the two posts, here’s the breakdown of emails I’ve received from readers:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pie-chart.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3579\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pie-chart.png\" alt=\"pie chart\" width=\"317\" height=\"370\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There have been <em>thousands </em>of emails. Apparently this whole thing isn’t just me.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the emails aren’t quick, “Hey I liked the procrastination posts bye” notes—they’re <em>thorough</em>. And heartfelt. A good number of them mention that the posts made them cry. And they’re not crying because they were moved by my shitty stick drawings—they’re crying because <em>they were reading about</em><em> one of the biggest problems in their lives.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The profiles of those who have emailed range wildly, covering all ages, all kinds of professions, and hailing from almost every country in the world. I’ve heard from a 13-year-old in Pakistan, a middle-aged professor in Argentina, an 80-year-old retired nurse in Mississippi; a German graphic designer, an Australian author, a Ghanaian filmmaker, a Korean entrepreneur. And the PhD students—the hordes of PhD students—doing the ultimate Q2 task.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In one way, these people all have the same exact problem, and the same problem I have—an Instant Gratification Monkey they can’t control. But I’ve noticed, after reading every one of their stories, that the extent to which this problem is ruining their lives varies drastically, depending on a few key facts about their particular circumstances. This distinction places the readers who have emailed into three categories:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) The Disastinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disastinators-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3572\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disastinators-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Disastinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of all procrastinators out there, the Disastinators are in the worst shape. A Disastinator is permanently camped out in Quadrant 4, and procrastination is completely destroying their life. A procrastinator usually becomes a Disastinator for one of two reasons:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A) Their monkey has stopped being scared of the Panic Monster and has become all-powerful</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>B) They’re a normal procrastinator but they’re in a life situation with no external deadlines or pressure</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Situation A is super-dark, and as I’ve learned from reader emails, not that uncommon. These people have lost the ability to do almost anything that matters to them and are either in a downward spiral or have given up entirely.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In Situation B, the Disastinator isn’t a worse procrastinator than any other, it’s just that their circumstances are a catastrophic match for their personality. The nature of their life and work gives the Panic Monster no reason to wake up at all, and unfortunately, the monkey isn’t scared of the Self-Loathing Monster.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/self.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3567\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/self.png\" alt=\"self\" width=\"630\" height=\"239\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The outcome is that the Disastinator gets nothing done, ever. Many of the PhD candidates who emailed me fall into this category.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) The Impostinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We haven’t talked much about Quadrant 3, but it might be the most dangerous quadrant of all, and it’s where the Impostinator reigns king. The Impostinator’s life looks like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Impostinators-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3571\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Impostinators-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Impostinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Impostinator <em>seems</em> productive, but she’s really an imposter—a procrastinator wearing a productive person mask. By spending all of her work time in Q3, she seems busy—she <em>is </em>busy—but she never seems to make much progress on her real goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Impostinators have clever monkeys, and Q3 is the monkey’s most clever trick. The monkey knows that the RDM, who can be gullible, can be appeased if he spends ample time out of the Q4 Dark Playground. So the Impostinator’s monkey creates a battle that goes back and forth between Q4 and Q3, and that works because Q3 <em>feels </em>productive to the Impostinator. It relies on one major delusion of the Impostinator—that busy = productive.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So an Impostinator will spend the whole day answering emails, running errands, making phone calls, organizing lists and schedules, participating in meetings, etc. and if she’s judging herself by time spent out of the Dark Playground, she’s a smashing success. But at the end of the day, the satisfaction she feels has a hint of emptiness to it, and the Happy Playground is never quite fully happy. She may have deluded herself into thinking she’s living a productive life, but in her subconscious, she knows she’s not doing what she’s supposed to be doing. Her feelings of accomplishment come along with an undercurrent of despair.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In reality, she’s living in a grand, overarching procrastination, brilliantly crafted by her monkey. Rather than try to win the tug-of-war between doing what matters—the stuff up in Q2—and the Dark Playground, the Impostinator’s monkey tricks the RDM into fighting on the wrong battlefield, and he lets the RDM “beat” him on this battlefield, which leads her to believe she’s doing a good job.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The other difficulty the Impostinator faces is that sometimes Q3 disguises itself as Q1. A busy Impostinator often believes that the urgent work she’s consumed with <em>is </em>important, but the problem with that is what Eisenhower himself said best:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span class=\"ft\">What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.</span></em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, <em>Quadrant 1 often does not exist. </em>This isn’t always the case, but it’s especially likely to be true for people who have yet to get their career rolling, because usually when your truly important work is also urgent, it means you have something good going on. This creates a catch-22, where the people who most need urgency in order to do things—procrastinators early in their career—are often those with a totally vacant Quadrant 1.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The more time goes on, the more I think that being super busy tends to mean having a packed Q3 (usually mixed in with too much Q4 time). I know that when I’m in one of those zones where I’m telling everyone how <i>busy </i>I am and how little time I have for them, it’s almost always because I’m overloaded with Q3 bullshit. People who are really on top of their life—really in control—tend to have plenty of space in their schedules. But society smiles upon busy people, the phrase “I think you have too much time on your hands” is an insult, and that leaves Impostinators looking—and often feeling—like they’re doing it right. And while the Impostinator will always feel superior to the Disastinator, the truth is that in terms of real productivity on things that matter, they’re equal.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The major lesson here is to beware of Quadrant 3. Q3 grabs you by the collar and thrusts you onto a treadmill of <em>reacting </em>to things. It’s not a place of self control. And if you’re not careful, Q3 will suck your life away. I know, because I’ve spent a lot of my life as an Impostinator.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of the many Impostinators who emailed me, the most common professions were artists of some kind or entrepreneurs. In both of those situations, you’re the boss of your own life, and the important work to do—improving your skills, deepening your network, executing a creative vision—is rarely urgent.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>3) The Successtinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After spending most of my life feeling unable to maximize myself, since starting Wait But Why a year and a half ago, I’ve written over 250,000 words—the equivalent of 1,000 book pages—and what I’m doing really <em>matters </em>to me. For the first time, the satisfaction of accomplishment doesn’t come along with a twinge of guilt or emptiness or despair. I’ve done it! I’m a <em>doer. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not quite.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reality is, I haven’t overcome my monkey problems one ounce more than the Impostinators and Disastinaters who emailed me—the big difference is, I’ve gotten myself into a situation where I have a big, fat Quadrant 1 in my life. Not a fake Q1 that’s really Q3 in disguise—but a genuine Q1, and it’s packed. The intimate relationship a blog has with real, living people—and the pressure that generates—turns a blogger’s important work into urgent work, as soon as there are enough readers that the Panic Monster takes interest in things.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a procrastinator, this is the opposite of the PhD-type situation, which I described as a catastrophic match for a procrasinator. Writing regularly with an immediate audience is an example of a terrific match for a procrastinator’s personality, because it puts his Panic Monster in the optimal location—it aligns the Panic Monster with his most important endeavor.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, my monkey is still wreaking havoc over my whole life in any way he can—I pulled a lifespan-reducing all-nighter to finish this post. But there’s a key distinction between what he’s doing now and what he was doing during my previous projects. With those other projects, he spent his Q4 time pursuing real, ambitious projects—and he was allowed to do that because the RDM wasn’t entirely sure what <em>he</em> wanted, and he would question whether the monkey was actually on to something with his distractions. But at least so far, working on Wait But Why is hitting the nail on the head for the RDM, because he’s actually spending a lot of time above the important line, so he has a <em>conviction </em>about the undertaking he didn’t previously. Because of this, he’ll let the monkey tap dance around Q4 and Q3, mainly because he has no power not to, but he <em>won’t </em>allow the monkey to take on anything <em>serious </em>with his time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have not conquered procrastination, but for the time being, at least, I’m in the least bad type of procrastinator situation—I’m a Successtinator.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Successtinators-Matrix1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3578\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Successtinators-Matrix1.png\" alt=\"Successtinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A successtinator has found a solution-ish to his problems, but it’s not pretty, often not healthy, and usually not sustainable. It’s a clever duct-taping of a troubled machine to hold it over temporarily.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I received a lot of emails from Successtinators, and the patterns were consistent and resonate with my own current situation. A Successtinator can be happy with his life, but isn’t usually that happy <em>in </em>his life. And that’s because being a Successtinator does not make you a success. Someone who does something well professionally at the expense of balance, relationships, and health is not a success. Real success means having both professional life <em>and </em>lifestyle working well and in harmony—and Successtinators are too stressed, too unavailable, and are often completely deprived of Happy Playground time, which is a critical component of a happy life. A Successtinator is also usually limited in his professional possibilities—great work can be done in Q1, but it’s often more on the <em>maintaining </em>side of things. Q2 is still where most of the professional growth and out-of-the-box thinking takes place, and like all procrastinators, Successtinators rarely set foot in Q2.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are bigger problems in the world than procrastination. Things like poverty, disease, mental illness, and drug addiction all make procrastination seem glaringly like a problem of the privileged—something to suffer over for those whose lives have no real suffering.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But if a skeptic spent a few hours reading through the mound of procrastination-related emails I’ve received, I think they’d agree that this is a dire problem in many, many lives. And it doesn’t just harm the procrastinator—it hurts the people close to the procrastinator, spreading the effect.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It’s also the world’s loss. For every Steve Jobs or John Lennon or Hillary Clinton or J.K. Rowling or anyone else whose talents have enhanced our lives, there are thousands of people with just as much potential who never achieve much for the world because they waste away their time in the wrong quadrants.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One way to look at this is that each human life has a certain number of “time points,” and it’s up to you how you “spend” them. Consider the difference between someone who spends 30 hours a week in Q2 and someone else who only manages two hours of Q2 time a week. Since Q2 is, for many, where real advancement happens, over the course of their lives, the 30 hour person will accomplish <em>15 times </em>as much in her life as the two hour person. And in reality, the multiplier is probably even larger than 15, since progress builds upon progress and the rate can accelerate (i.e. Steve Jobs wouldn’t have accomplished 1/15th of what he accomplished if he had put in 1/15th the productive hours—he probably would have accomplished none of it.) The distinction between an ordinary person and an extraordinary person might simply come down to the differences in how they allot their time points.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Clearing away delusion</strong></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we want to improve our time point spending, the first step is learning to see the world through a crystal clear Eisenhower Matrix—which means shaking off all delusion. We need to develop well-thought-out definitions of <em>urgent </em>and <em>important</em>, which will be different for everyone and requires a deep dig into the highly personal question, “What matters most to me?”</p><p>Brett McKay <a href=\"http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/23/eisenhower-decision-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> “important tasks” as<em> things that contribute to our long-term mission, values, and goals. </em>This is broad and straightforward and a good core sentence to come back to when assessing importance down the road.</p><p>The thought process about what is and isn’t urgent should revolve around the self-discussion of what’s most important. Ideally, urgent would <em>not </em>mean, “The thing grabbing me hardest by the collar”—it would be defined by what, of the important tasks on your list, <em>would</em> <em>benefit most from happening sooner rather than later.</em> Using this definition, spending time with your kids would certainly qualify as urgent, while under the typical deadline-related definition of urgent, it would qualify as “not urgent.” In other words, the order of your priorities is much better off being set by your RDM than your Panic Monster. Wisdom resides in the RDM, and when the mindless Panic Monster calls the shots on what’s urgent and what’s not, you take the RDM’s wisdom out of the game.</p><p>You may also want to gather some hard data on how you’re currently spending your time points, by logging your hours for the next week and seeing just how many of them fall into each of the four quadrants (you’ll probably be unpleasantly surprised by the results).</p><h2><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Becoming the boss of your brain</strong></span></h2><p>Once you feel clear on your Eisenhower Matrix and where its various boundaries lie, you’ll need to do the hard part and gain control over how you spend your time points within it. Which, for a procrastinator, is life’s greatest challenge.</p><p>The rewards of gaining control are obvious. It’s incredible how much a person can get done—while also maintaining a balanced lifestyle—if they’re in control of their time point spending. And those not in control will lose most of their time points to Q3 and Q4 and feel like they don’t have time for either their work or their lifestyle, all while accomplishing very little. Time point allotment is everything.</p><p>A procrastinator in desperate straits can take a half step in the right direction through the brute force method of rearranging his life in a way that makes him a successtinator. That’s where I am now, and it’s a hell of a lot better than where I was before.</p><p>But that’s like hiring a bodyguard instead of learning how to fight. The real goal of a procrastinator must be to figure out how to become the boss of his brain. A procrastinator’s reality is that his inner self—his Rational Decision-Maker—is the grandmaster of his life in theory, but in practice, only a spectator. The procrastinator’s RDM goes, helplessly, where the waves take him, shuffled from activity to activity by the primal forces of the monkey and the Panic Monster. Until a procrastinator’s RDM can walk, on his own, from Q4 to Q2, whenever he wants to, he’s not fixed.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you Google “how to stop procrastinating,” you’ll find about 1,000 articles, all offering terrific advice on how to do it. The problem is that the articles are always written for sane people, and procrastinators aren’t sane people. Being insane, procrastinators are always under the delusion that they’re sane, so they read an advice article and <em>think </em>they’ll be able to apply it to their life. But then it doesn’t work out that way.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before a procrastinator can act on good advice, he needs to have control. A race car driver can get all the coaching in the world, but if, when the race starts, someone else is controlling the steering wheel and the pedals, all the coaching is useless.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That’s why the only way a procrastinator can take the wheel in his hands is if his self-fulfilling prophecy—his <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>storyline</em></a>— says that he can. And storylines only change with real-world action. Quite the chicken and egg issue.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At its deepest level, it comes down to a battle of confidence. The RDM and monkey each have their own idea of how to spend your time points, and whichever of them is more confident—whoever has a stronger belief that <em>they’re </em>the alpha dog in the relationship—ends up prevailing. The difference between a procrastinator and a non-procrastinator is simply that the procrastinator’s monkey and RDM both believe that the monkey is the alpha dog, and the non-procrastinator’s pair both believe that the RDM is the boss.</p><p>But as firmly entrenched as these confidence levels may feel, the monkey and the RDM share a single pool of confidence with a fixed sum—when one’s confidence goes up, the other’s goes down—and the balance can begin to be tipped by the smallest changes, taking your storyline with it.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Figuring out the starting point of this chicken and egg paradox is each procrastinator’s personal quest. But a universal starting point is to try to remain <em>aware</em> as much as possible. Aware of what’s important, aware of what’s urgent, and most importantly—aware of the monkey. The monkey is not your friend, and he never will be. But he’s also part of your head and impossible to get rid of, so get in the habit of noticing him. When you wake up in the morning, he’ll be there. When you sit down to work, he’ll be there. Whenever you most badly need all the guts and grit you can muster, he’ll be there to take your guts and grit away.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But he thrives off of unconsciousness. Simply by noticing him and saying to yourself, “Yup, there’s the monkey, right on cue,” you can start to tip the balance out of its default state.

High school students are given all these lectures about &#8220;pacing yourself&#8221; on longer projects, and I proudly paced myself less than almost anyone I knew. I never missed a deadline, but I only did anything the night before it was due. I was a <em>procrastinator</em>.</p><p>Except I wasn&#8217;t. High school is full of regular deadlines and short-term projects, and even longterm projects had sub-deadlines that force pacing upon you. There were a <em>few </em>dire moments, but for the most part, I was just doing everything at the last minute because I knew I could probably still do well that way—so why not.</p><p>There was definitely an <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Instant Gratification Monkey</a><a href=\"#footnote-1-3539\" id=\"note-1-3539\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> in my head, but he was cute more than anything.

College is not like high school. The assignments are big, with a lot of time between deadlines, and since you&#8217;re not a child anymore, classes don&#8217;t treat you like one—no one forces you to pace anything. As a Government major, most of my classes involved a couple papers, a midterm, and a final exam over a four-month stretch, which means most of the time, there were no hard deadlines anywhere on the horizon.</p><p>Without deadlines to occupy him, my Panic Monster, who can&#8217;t think too far ahead, began to spend a lot of time in hibernation. My Rational Decision-Maker, who never realized how much he had relied on the Panic Monster, began to have difficulties carrying out his plans.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3561\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading1.png\" alt=\"Reading1\" width=\"600\" height=\"344\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3562\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reading2.png\" alt=\"Reading2\" width=\"600\" height=\"244\" /></a></p><p>The more the Panic Monster slept, the more confidence the monkey gained. The Rational Decision-Maker, the only member of the brain who sees the world clearly, was concerned—he knew that college assignments were a lot bigger than high school assignments, and that pacing was no longer something to scoff at, but a critical thing to do. He&#8217;d put his foot down about social commitments when a deadline began to draw closer, but that wouldn&#8217;t solve the problem.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3557\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie1.png\" alt=\"movie1\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3558\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie2.png\" alt=\"movie2\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3559\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/movie3.png\" alt=\"movie3\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /></a></p><p>The RDM would slip further into despair, and only the times when things reached their most dire would anything change.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3560\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper1.png\" alt=\"paper1\" width=\"350\" height=\"418\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3564\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper2.png\" alt=\"paper2\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3565\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper3.png\" alt=\"paper3\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3566\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/paper4.png\" alt=\"paper4\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p>It didn&#8217;t matter how obvious a decision seemed to the RDM, it was becoming clear that he was totally unable to control the monkey without the Panic Monster&#8217;s help.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3544\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension1.png\" alt=\"extension1\" width=\"350\" height=\"370\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3545\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension2.png\" alt=\"extension2\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3546\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension3.png\" alt=\"extension3\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3547\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension4.png\" alt=\"extension4\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3548\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/extension5.png\" alt=\"extension5\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" /></a></p><p>While college was often a disheartening experience for my RDM, it was a full renaissance for my Instant Gratification Monkey, who explored a wide range of activities in an effort to find himself. With a Yamaha electric keyboard right next to my desk, the monkey became increasingly passionate about playing the piano. It almost seemed like the times my RDM was stomping his foot the hardest about getting to work were the exact moments the monkey would feel the most spirited about putting on the headphones and becoming lost for hours in the piano.</p><p>When college ended, thrilled to be done forever with formal education, which was clearly not my thing, I burst out into the world with 1,000 ambitions to do 1,000 things. Just wait till the world saw me. I had everything imaginable to offer except knowledge, skills, and work ethic.</p><p>My RDM had done a lot of thinking about this, and he understood that the monkey had spent college trying to tell him something important—I wanted to be a <em>composer</em>. That was clearly the thing I was most drawn to, and finally, it would become the thing I was <em>supposed </em>to do each day. No more fighting the monkey—he was going to get exactly what he wanted. I had figured out life, and I moved to LA to write movie scores.</p><p>In order to pay my bills, I began tutoring kids after school on their homework or for the SAT, a side job I chose because it wouldn&#8217;t distract me from becoming the next John Williams. It was the perfect setup, I was brimming with excitement about music, and things were starting to move—when the weirdest thing happened. Just when I was sure I had found myself, the monkey began soul searching. When the RDM and I would sit down at the piano to write something—the exact activity the monkey spent college <em>obsessed </em>with—the monkey would throw a fit and refuse to join us. The RDM began to feel helpless, the same way he did in college.</p><p>Meanwhile, the monkey had found a new interest—he had become fixated with my <i>side job</i>. Tutoring was going well, referrals were increasing, and while the RDM would insist that we were already working with too many students, the monkey would accept every new job that came our way. Soon, the monkey started thinking bigger, and without running it by the rest of us, he began hiring my friends to tutor for me. The RDM would wake up eager to dive into composing, but the whole day would end up being spent on phone calls and buried in spreadsheets. The monkey had started a business.</p><p>My brain and I ended up in an unpleasant no-man&#8217;s land. The monkey refused to let us pour ourselves into our music career, and the RDM refused to embrace the monkey&#8217;s new business career. I was doing a lot of things and not giving my all to any of them.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spread-thin.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3563\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/spread-thin.png\" alt=\"spread thin\" width=\"600\" height=\"368\" /></a></p><p>It was around then that my best friend Andrew moved to LA. Andrew isn&#8217;t like me. He lives and breathes business, with no interest in pursuing anything in the arts, and ever since I met him when we were five, his monkey has been a tame little bitch who does what he&#8217;s told. After he moved, we started talking about maybe going into business together somehow. My RDM had refused to entertain taking business seriously until then, but the prospect of starting a company with Andrew and actually putting a full effort into it was enticing—and the monkey was clearly into it, so maybe <em>this</em> was the thing I was supposed to be doing all along. I decided to dive in, and building off of what I had started, we founded a new tutoring company together.</p><p>The RDM still wrestled with the decision to put a pause on the music side of things, but the company was growing quickly, being in business with Andrew was a great time—like playing a complex strategy game with your friend—and the RDM finally started to feel okay about becoming totally wrapped up in business.</p><p>Which was the monkey&#8217;s cue to become an avid blogger.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monkey-blog.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3556\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/monkey-blog.png\" alt=\"monkey blog\" width=\"629\" height=\"386\" /></a></p><p>I had been casually blogging for a few years at that point, but business taking off was just what the monkey needed to kick his new writing hobby into full gear, and over the next few years, I wrote hundreds of blog posts in my off hours. I went into work every day, and I&#8217;d be engaged while I was there—but instead of doing what an entrepreneur is supposed to do outside of work and keep the wheels turning, mulling over the strategy and allowing the subconscious to drop key epiphanies on you from time to time, I&#8217;d be thinking about what to blog about next.</p><p>In 2013, when Andrew and I decided to start something new, we looked at my monkey, saw how absorbed he always was with his blog, and thought maybe <em>that</em> was the thing I was supposed to be doing this whole time—so we started Wait But Why. Andrew would continue to grow our company while I&#8217;d fully immerse myself in this new project, giving the monkey exactly what he so badly wanted.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">What was classic procrastination in college morphed into a bizarre form of insanity once I entered the real world. On a day-to-day, micro level, there was still always an element of the normal &#8220;RDM tries to do something, monkey makes it difficult&#8221; thing, but in a broader, macro sense, it was almost as if I were <em>chasing </em>the monkey. After he defeated me so soundly in college, I wondered if fighting against him in the first place was my mistake. He&#8217;s born from some inner, primal part of me, so wouldn&#8217;t it make sense to pay attention to his inclinations and use <em>them </em>as my guide?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So that&#8217;s what I tried to do—when he&#8217;d be continually drawn to something, I&#8217;d eventually take his lead and build my life around that. But the problem was, he was almost like a mirage—once I&#8217;d get to where he was, he wouldn&#8217;t be there anymore. He&#8217;d be somewhere else. This was confusing—was he there before because he actually wanted to be, or was he just there because it was where the RDM was <em>not</em>? Did he actually have passions of his own, or was he just some elusive evil contrarian inside of me with a mission to hold me back from ever doing anything great with my talents and energies?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last year, I came across a little diagram that I think holds the key to these questions. It&#8217;s called the Eisenhower Matrix:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3577\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Eisenhower Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Eisenhower Matrix places anything you could spend your time doing on two spectrums: one going from the most urgent possible task to the least urgent, the other going from critically important to totally inconsequential—and using these as axes, divides your world into four quadrants.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The matrix was popularized in Stephen Covey&#8217;s famous book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451639619/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1451639619&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=NWOAUWNGA6LU6OH3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em></a> and is named after President Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower was well-known for being tremendously productive, which Covey credits to his &#8220;first things first&#8221; attitude on how to spend your time. And to Eisenhower, the &#8220;first things&#8221; were always the <em>important </em>ones. He believed you should spend nearly all of your time in Quadrants 1 and 2, and he accomplished this with a simple D-word for each quadrant:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix-Actions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3576\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower-Matrix-Actions.png\" alt=\"Eisenhower Matrix Actions\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And that&#8217;s fantastic for Dwight fucking Eisenhower. But you know what Dwight clearly didn&#8217;t have in his bald head? An all-powerful Instant Gratification Monkey. If he had, he&#8217;d know that a procrastinator&#8217;s matrix looks like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Procrastinators-Matrix1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3582\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Procrastinators-Matrix1.png\" alt=\"Procrastinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you ever want any information on Quadrant 4—directions, places to eat, etc.—just ask a procrastinator. They live there. For a non-procrastinator, Q4 is a happy place to spend time. After a productive day working on important tasks, it feels great to kick back in Q4—and under those circumstances, there&#8217;s a name for Q4: <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Happy Playground</a>. But procrastinators don&#8217;t tend to hang out in Q4 after an efficient day of high-level work—they&#8217;re there far more often than that, against their will, because the monkey has dragged them there, all while the Rational Decision-Maker is <em>begging </em>them to leave. And they have a different name for Q4: <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Dark Playground</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As for Quadrants 1 and 3—the <em>urgent </em>quadrants—most procrastinators will end up there from time to time, usually in a full sweat, with the Panic Monster next to their face screaming. Q1 and Q3 keep the procrastinator off the streets.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And then there&#8217;s Quadrant 2. To a procrastinator, Quadrant 2 is a strange and foreign land, far, far away. Kind of like Atlantis, or Narnia. He knows it&#8217;s an important place, and he&#8217;s tried many times to go there, but there&#8217;s a big problem—the monkey is repulsed by it, and the Panic Monster isn&#8217;t concerned with it. And that&#8217;s the deadly combo that defeats the procrastinator every time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reason this is disastrous is that the road to the procrastinator&#8217;s dreams—the road to expanding his horizons, exploring his true potential, and achieving work he&#8217;s truly proud of—runs directly through Quadrant 2. Q1 and Q3 may be where people survive, but Q2 is where people thrive, grow, and blossom.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But if you&#8217;re a procrastinator, you&#8217;re in luck. You have an ace up your sleeve—someone daring and fearless, with bountiful energy and dynamic talent, and someone who can defeat the monkey like stepping on an ant: Future You.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Future You is a procrastinator&#8217;s most important ally—someone who&#8217;s always there and always has your back, no matter what. I know all about this firsthand. Future Tim is an amazing guy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When my alarm goes off and I don&#8217;t want to wake up, I just press the snooze button, which doles out the job of getting out of bed to Future Tim instead. My to-do list has two parts—a short, easy one for me, and a long one, full of all the things I can&#8217;t imagine ever doing, because they&#8217;re so icky-seeming. Future Tim always handles that one, without a complaint. Future Tim also has no problem with even the vilest of social obligations. I was recently invited to attend a feedback-giving session for a three-hour-long play written by someone I barely know—I certainly had no intention of ever doing that, but I would also have felt guilty just saying no, so I explained that I have a busy couple months, but that I&#8217;d be more than happy to join when it happens again this summer, a time when it&#8217;ll be Future Tim&#8217;s problem, not mine.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Future Tim also has a discipline and balance to his lifestyle I could only ever dream of. I&#8217;ve never been much of an exerciser—but Future Tim belongs to a gym and does all the jogging for both of us, and I love how into cooking healthy meals Future Tim is, because I personally don&#8217;t have the time. Future Tim is the kind of guy we all want to be like—I suggest getting to know him yourself, which you can do by buying his books, since he&#8217;s a prolific author.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But the most important role Future Tim plays in my life brings us back to the Eisenhower Matrix. In a convenient stroke of fate, Future Tim happens to spend almost all of his time in the one place I can never seem to get to myself: the all-important Quadrant 2. Future Tim is Quadrant 2&#8217;s warden, and when I make a list of important to-do items and notice that most of them seem to land in Q2, I don&#8217;t have to despair, because I know Future Tim is on top of them. Which is good, considering how dire a situation Past Tim, that useless fuck, has often left me in:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FT1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3569\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FT1.png\" alt=\"FT\" width=\"600\" height=\"419\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But for all of Future Tim&#8217;s virtues, he has one fatal flaw that kind of ruins everything: he doesn&#8217;t exist.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It turns out that Future You is as much of a mirage as the monkey&#8217;s passion for a hobby. I banked on Future Tim&#8217;s real-world existence for my most important plans, but every time I&#8217;d finally arrive at a time when I thought I would find Future Tim, he was nowhere to be found—the only person there would be stupid Present Tim. That&#8217;s the thing that really sucks about Future You—whenever time finally gets to him, he&#8217;s not Future You anymore, he&#8217;s Present You, and Present You can&#8217;t do the tasks you assigned to Future You because those tasks can only be done by someone without a monkey. You assigned them to Future You in the first place because he doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> a monkey—that was the whole point. So you do what you always do—you re-delegate them to Future You, hoping that next time time catches up with Future You, he actually exists.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is what left me unable, for years, to give life my full effort. The important work to be done usually lives in Q2, a place I had a hard time going to, so I&#8217;d direct the extra energy to a passionate hobby instead. The monkey would get super into these hobbies, because hobbies are, by definition, in Q4—a place the monkey loves to be.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So here&#8217;s what went on when I was supposed to be pursuing a composing career:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Composer-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3575\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Composer-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Composer Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And when I decided to &#8220;follow the monkey&#8217;s lead&#8221; and take on business, I was missing the key point: &#8220;taking on&#8221; business meant making business the thing I was <em>supposed to do</em>, which turned it from a <em>not important </em>task into an <em>important </em>one—moving &#8220;business&#8221; from Q4, the monkey&#8217;s favorite place, to Q2, his least favorite place.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3574\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Business-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Business Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The fact that I expected the monkey to remain obsessed with business after the switch to Q2 shows how little I understood the monkey. The monkey&#8217;s passion never was music, or business, or blogging—the monkey&#8217;s passion was always Q4.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the thing the monkey <em>really </em>likes about Q4 isn&#8217;t anything about Q4 in particular—it&#8217;s that <em>Quadrant 4 isn&#8217;t Quadrant 1 or 2.</em> The monkey, whose core drive is to do whatever&#8217;s <em>easiest</em>, can&#8217;t stand the &#8220;important&#8221; quadrants, because the important quadrants are where the pressure&#8217;s on—it&#8217;s where there&#8217;s something to prove, where your actions have consequences, where the stakes are high, and where you&#8217;re shooting for the stars, <em>which means you might fail to reach them. </em>No fucking thanks, says the monkey. Writing 300 blog posts while I was supposed to be dreaming up brilliant business growth strategies wasn&#8217;t &#8220;easy&#8221; in the sense that I didn&#8217;t have to work hard to write them—it was easy in that there was nothing at stake. Stakes are really what’s hard for a human.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When I started writing posts for Wait But Why, I knew I wanted to write about procrastination. I needed to try to articulate the madness that went on in my head. After assigning that daunting mission to Future Tim for a while, I finally bit the bullet and <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">did it</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reaction was overwhelming. In addition to the over 1,300 comments on the two posts, here&#8217;s the breakdown of emails I&#8217;ve received from readers:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pie-chart.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3579\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/pie-chart.png\" alt=\"pie chart\" width=\"317\" height=\"370\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There have been <em>thousands </em>of emails. Apparently this whole thing isn&#8217;t just me.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">And the emails aren&#8217;t quick, &#8220;Hey I liked the procrastination posts bye&#8221; notes—they&#8217;re <em>thorough</em>. And heartfelt. A good number of them mention that the posts made them cry. And they&#8217;re not crying because they were moved by my shitty stick drawings—they&#8217;re crying because <em>they were reading about</em><em> one of the biggest problems in their lives.</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The profiles of those who have emailed range wildly, covering all ages, all kinds of professions, and hailing from almost every country in the world. I&#8217;ve heard from a 13-year-old in Pakistan, a middle-aged professor in Argentina, an 80-year-old retired nurse in Mississippi; a German graphic designer, an Australian author, a Ghanaian filmmaker, a Korean entrepreneur. And the PhD students—the hordes of PhD students—doing the ultimate Q2 task.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In one way, these people all have the same exact problem, and the same problem I have—an Instant Gratification Monkey they can&#8217;t control. But I&#8217;ve noticed, after reading every one of their stories, that the extent to which this problem is ruining their lives varies drastically, depending on a few key facts about their particular circumstances. This distinction places the readers who have emailed into three categories:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>1) The Disastinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disastinators-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3572\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Disastinators-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Disastinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of all procrastinators out there, the Disastinators are in the worst shape. A Disastinator is permanently camped out in Quadrant 4, and procrastination is completely destroying their life. A procrastinator usually becomes a Disastinator for one of two reasons:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A) Their monkey has stopped being scared of the Panic Monster and has become all-powerful</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>B) They&#8217;re a normal procrastinator but they&#8217;re in a life situation with no external deadlines or pressure</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Situation A is super-dark, and as I&#8217;ve learned from reader emails, not that uncommon. These people have lost the ability to do almost anything that matters to them and are either in a downward spiral or have given up entirely.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In Situation B, the Disastinator isn&#8217;t a worse procrastinator than any other, it&#8217;s just that their circumstances are a catastrophic match for their personality. The nature of their life and work gives the Panic Monster no reason to wake up at all, and unfortunately, the monkey isn&#8217;t scared of the Self-Loathing Monster.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/self.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3567\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/self.png\" alt=\"self\" width=\"630\" height=\"239\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The outcome is that the Disastinator gets nothing done, ever. Many of the PhD candidates who emailed me fall into this category.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>2) The Impostinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We haven&#8217;t talked much about Quadrant 3, but it might be the most dangerous quadrant of all, and it&#8217;s where the Impostinator reigns king. The Impostinator&#8217;s life looks like this:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Impostinators-Matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3571\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Impostinators-Matrix.png\" alt=\"Impostinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Impostinator <em>seems</em> productive, but she&#8217;s really an imposter—a procrastinator wearing a productive person mask. By spending all of her work time in Q3, she seems busy—she <em>is </em>busy—but she never seems to make much progress on her real goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Impostinators have clever monkeys, and Q3 is the monkey&#8217;s most clever trick. The monkey knows that the RDM, who can be gullible, can be appeased if he spends ample time out of the Q4 Dark Playground. So the Impostinator&#8217;s monkey creates a battle that goes back and forth between Q4 and Q3, and that works because Q3 <em>feels </em>productive to the Impostinator. It relies on one major delusion of the Impostinator—that busy = productive.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So an Impostinator will spend the whole day answering emails, running errands, making phone calls, organizing lists and schedules, participating in meetings, etc. and if she&#8217;s judging herself by time spent out of the Dark Playground, she&#8217;s a smashing success. But at the end of the day, the satisfaction she feels has a hint of emptiness to it, and the Happy Playground is never quite fully happy. She may have deluded herself into thinking she&#8217;s living a productive life, but in her subconscious, she knows she&#8217;s not doing what she&#8217;s supposed to be doing. Her feelings of accomplishment come along with an undercurrent of despair.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In reality, she&#8217;s living in a grand, overarching procrastination, brilliantly crafted by her monkey. Rather than try to win the tug-of-war between doing what matters—the stuff up in Q2—and the Dark Playground, the Impostinator&#8217;s monkey tricks the RDM into fighting on the wrong battlefield, and he lets the RDM &#8220;beat&#8221; him on this battlefield, which leads her to believe she&#8217;s doing a good job.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The other difficulty the Impostinator faces is that sometimes Q3 disguises itself as Q1. A busy Impostinator often believes that the urgent work she&#8217;s consumed with <em>is </em>important, but the problem with that is what Eisenhower himself said best:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span class=\"ft\">What is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.</span></em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In other words, <em>Quadrant 1 often does not exist. </em>This isn&#8217;t always the case, but it&#8217;s especially likely to be true for people who have yet to get their career rolling, because usually when your truly important work is also urgent, it means you have something good going on. This creates a catch-22, where the people who most need urgency in order to do things—procrastinators early in their career—are often those with a totally vacant Quadrant 1.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The more time goes on, the more I think that being super busy tends to mean having a packed Q3 (usually mixed in with too much Q4 time). I know that when I&#8217;m in one of those zones where I&#8217;m telling everyone how <i>busy </i>I am and how little time I have for them, it&#8217;s almost always because I&#8217;m overloaded with Q3 bullshit. People who are really on top of their life—really in control—tend to have plenty of space in their schedules. But society smiles upon busy people, the phrase &#8220;I think you have too much time on your hands&#8221; is an insult, and that leaves Impostinators looking—and often feeling—like they&#8217;re doing it right. And while the Impostinator will always feel superior to the Disastinator, the truth is that in terms of real productivity on things that matter, they&#8217;re equal.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The major lesson here is to beware of Quadrant 3. Q3 grabs you by the collar and thrusts you onto a treadmill of <em>reacting </em>to things. It&#8217;s not a place of self control. And if you&#8217;re not careful, Q3 will suck your life away. I know, because I&#8217;ve spent a lot of my life as an Impostinator.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of the many Impostinators who emailed me, the most common professions were artists of some kind or entrepreneurs. In both of those situations, you&#8217;re the boss of your own life, and the important work to do—improving your skills, deepening your network, executing a creative vision—is rarely urgent.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>3) The Successtinators</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After spending most of my life feeling unable to maximize myself, since starting Wait But Why a year and a half ago, I&#8217;ve written over 250,000 words—the equivalent of 1,000 book pages—and what I&#8217;m doing really <em>matters </em>to me. For the first time, the satisfaction of accomplishment doesn&#8217;t come along with a twinge of guilt or emptiness or despair. I&#8217;ve done it! I&#8217;m a <em>doer. </em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not quite.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The reality is, I haven&#8217;t overcome my monkey problems one ounce more than the Impostinators and Disastinaters who emailed me—the big difference is, I&#8217;ve gotten myself into a situation where I have a big, fat Quadrant 1 in my life. Not a fake Q1 that&#8217;s really Q3 in disguise—but a genuine Q1, and it&#8217;s packed. The intimate relationship a blog has with real, living people—and the pressure that generates—turns a blogger&#8217;s important work into urgent work, as soon as there are enough readers that the Panic Monster takes interest in things.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">For a procrastinator, this is the opposite of the PhD-type situation, which I described as a catastrophic match for a procrasinator. Writing regularly with an immediate audience is an example of a terrific match for a procrastinator&#8217;s personality, because it puts his Panic Monster in the optimal location—it aligns the Panic Monster with his most important endeavor.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, my monkey is still wreaking havoc over my whole life in any way he can—I pulled a lifespan-reducing all-nighter to finish this post. But there&#8217;s a key distinction between what he&#8217;s doing now and what he was doing during my previous projects. With those other projects, he spent his Q4 time pursuing real, ambitious projects—and he was allowed to do that because the RDM wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what <em>he</em> wanted, and he would question whether the monkey was actually on to something with his distractions. But at least so far, working on Wait But Why is hitting the nail on the head for the RDM, because he&#8217;s actually spending a lot of time above the important line, so he has a <em>conviction </em>about the undertaking he didn&#8217;t previously. Because of this, he&#8217;ll let the monkey tap dance around Q4 and Q3, mainly because he has no power not to, but he <em>won&#8217;t </em>allow the monkey to take on anything <em>serious </em>with his time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I have not conquered procrastination, but for the time being, at least, I&#8217;m in the least bad type of procrastinator situation—I&#8217;m a Successtinator.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Successtinators-Matrix1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3578\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Successtinators-Matrix1.png\" alt=\"Successtinator's Matrix\" width=\"400\" height=\"445\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A successtinator has found a solution-ish to his problems, but it&#8217;s not pretty, often not healthy, and usually not sustainable. It&#8217;s a clever duct-taping of a troubled machine to hold it over temporarily.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I received a lot of emails from Successtinators, and the patterns were consistent and resonate with my own current situation. A Successtinator can be happy with his life, but isn&#8217;t usually that happy <em>in </em>his life. And that&#8217;s because being a Successtinator does not make you a success. Someone who does something well professionally at the expense of balance, relationships, and health is not a success. Real success means having both professional life <em>and </em>lifestyle working well and in harmony—and Successtinators are too stressed, too unavailable, and are often completely deprived of Happy Playground time, which is a critical component of a happy life. A Successtinator is also usually limited in his professional possibilities—great work can be done in Q1, but it&#8217;s often more on the <em>maintaining </em>side of things. Q2 is still where most of the professional growth and out-of-the-box thinking takes place, and like all procrastinators, Successtinators rarely set foot in Q2.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are bigger problems in the world than procrastination. Things like poverty, disease, mental illness, and drug addiction all make procrastination seem glaringly like a problem of the privileged—something to suffer over for those whose lives have no real suffering.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But if a skeptic spent a few hours reading through the mound of procrastination-related emails I&#8217;ve received, I think they&#8217;d agree that this is a dire problem in many, many lives. And it doesn&#8217;t just harm the procrastinator—it hurts the people close to the procrastinator, spreading the effect.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It&#8217;s also the world&#8217;s loss. For every Steve Jobs or John Lennon or Hillary Clinton or J.K. Rowling or anyone else whose talents have enhanced our lives, there are thousands of people with just as much potential who never achieve much for the world because they waste away their time in the wrong quadrants.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One way to look at this is that each human life has a certain number of &#8220;time points,&#8221; and it&#8217;s up to you how you &#8220;spend&#8221; them. Consider the difference between someone who spends 30 hours a week in Q2 and someone else who only manages two hours of Q2 time a week. Since Q2 is, for many, where real advancement happens, over the course of their lives, the 30 hour person will accomplish <em>15 times </em>as much in her life as the two hour person. And in reality, the multiplier is probably even larger than 15, since progress builds upon progress and the rate can accelerate (i.e. Steve Jobs wouldn&#8217;t have accomplished 1/15th of what he accomplished if he had put in 1/15th the productive hours—he probably would have accomplished none of it.) The distinction between an ordinary person and an extraordinary person might simply come down to the differences in how they allot their time points.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Clearing away delusion</strong></span></h2><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we want to improve our time point spending, the first step is learning to see the world through a crystal clear Eisenhower Matrix—which means shaking off all delusion. We need to develop well-thought-out definitions of <em>urgent </em>and <em>important</em>, which will be different for everyone and requires a deep dig into the highly personal question, &#8220;What matters most to me?&#8221;</p><p>Brett McKay <a href=\"http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/23/eisenhower-decision-matrix/\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> &#8220;important tasks&#8221; as<em> things that contribute to our long-term mission, values, and goals. </em>This is broad and straightforward and a good core sentence to come back to when assessing importance down the road.</p><p>The thought process about what is and isn&#8217;t urgent should revolve around the self-discussion of what&#8217;s most important. Ideally, urgent would <em>not </em>mean, &#8220;The thing grabbing me hardest by the collar&#8221;—it would be defined by what, of the important tasks on your list, <em>would</em> <em>benefit most from happening sooner rather than later.</em> Using this definition, spending time with your kids would certainly qualify as urgent, while under the typical deadline-related definition of urgent, it would qualify as &#8220;not urgent.&#8221; In other words, the order of your priorities is much better off being set by your RDM than your Panic Monster. Wisdom resides in the RDM, and when the mindless Panic Monster calls the shots on what&#8217;s urgent and what&#8217;s not, you take the RDM&#8217;s wisdom out of the game.</p><p>You may also want to gather some hard data on how you&#8217;re currently spending your time points, by logging your hours for the next week and seeing just how many of them fall into each of the four quadrants (you&#8217;ll probably be unpleasantly surprised by the results).</p><h2><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Becoming the boss of your brain</strong></span></h2><p>Once you feel clear on your Eisenhower Matrix and where its various boundaries lie, you&#8217;ll need to do the hard part and gain control over how you spend your time points within it. Which, for a procrastinator, is life&#8217;s greatest challenge.</p><p>The rewards of gaining control are obvious. It&#8217;s incredible how much a person can get done—while also maintaining a balanced lifestyle—if they&#8217;re in control of their time point spending. And those not in control will lose most of their time points to Q3 and Q4 and feel like they don&#8217;t have time for either their work or their lifestyle, all while accomplishing very little. Time point allotment is everything.</p><p>A procrastinator in desperate straits can take a half step in the right direction through the brute force method of rearranging his life in a way that makes him a successtinator. That&#8217;s where I am now, and it&#8217;s a hell of a lot better than where I was before.</p><p>But that&#8217;s like hiring a bodyguard instead of learning how to fight. The real goal of a procrastinator must be to figure out how to become the boss of his brain. A procrastinator&#8217;s reality is that his inner self—his Rational Decision-Maker—is the grandmaster of his life in theory, but in practice, only a spectator. The procrastinator&#8217;s RDM goes, helplessly, where the waves take him, shuffled from activity to activity by the primal forces of the monkey and the Panic Monster. Until a procrastinator&#8217;s RDM can walk, on his own, from Q4 to Q2, whenever he wants to, he&#8217;s not fixed.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you Google &#8220;how to stop procrastinating,&#8221; you&#8217;ll find about 1,000 articles, all offering terrific advice on how to do it. The problem is that the articles are always written for sane people, and procrastinators aren&#8217;t sane people. Being insane, procrastinators are always under the delusion that they&#8217;re sane, so they read an advice article and <em>think </em>they&#8217;ll be able to apply it to their life. But then it doesn&#8217;t work out that way.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before a procrastinator can act on good advice, he needs to have control. A race car driver can get all the coaching in the world, but if, when the race starts, someone else is controlling the steering wheel and the pedals, all the coaching is useless.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That&#8217;s why the only way a procrastinator can take the wheel in his hands is if his self-fulfilling prophecy—his <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>storyline</em></a>— says that he can. And storylines only change with real-world action. Quite the chicken and egg issue.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At its deepest level, it comes down to a battle of confidence. The RDM and monkey each have their own idea of how to spend your time points, and whichever of them is more confident—whoever has a stronger belief that <em>they&#8217;re </em>the alpha dog in the relationship—ends up prevailing. The difference between a procrastinator and a non-procrastinator is simply that the procrastinator&#8217;s monkey and RDM both believe that the monkey is the alpha dog, and the non-procrastinator&#8217;s pair both believe that the RDM is the boss.</p><p>But as firmly entrenched as these confidence levels may feel, the monkey and the RDM share a single pool of confidence with a fixed sum—when one&#8217;s confidence goes up, the other&#8217;s goes down—and the balance can begin to be tipped by the smallest changes, taking your storyline with it.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Figuring out the starting point of this chicken and egg paradox is each procrastinator&#8217;s personal quest. But a universal starting point is to try to remain <em>aware</em> as much as possible. Aware of what&#8217;s important, aware of what&#8217;s urgent, and most importantly—aware of the monkey. The monkey is not your friend, and he never will be. But he&#8217;s also part of your head and impossible to get rid of, so get in the habit of noticing him. When you wake up in the morning, he&#8217;ll be there. When you sit down to work, he&#8217;ll be there. Whenever you most badly need all the guts and grit you can muster, he&#8217;ll be there to take your guts and grit away.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But he thrives off of unconsciousness. Simply by noticing him and saying to yourself, &#8220;Yup, there&#8217;s the monkey, right on cue,&#8221; you can start to tip the balance out of its default state.

The <a href=\"http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\" target=\"_blank\">world population</a> has grown by 194,000,000, or almost 3%, since then.</p><p>Second, 7.3 billion people is a lot of people. If each living human were represented by a dry grain of rice, the rice would fill a cube-shaped box with a side of 6.1 meters,<a href=\"#footnote2-1-3475\" id=\"note2-1-3475\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> or about 20 feet—around the size of a two-story house.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rice.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3500 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rice.png\" alt=\"Rice\" width=\"651\" height=\"360\" /></a></p><p>That’s a lot of rice grains.</p><p>And how about 7.3 billion grains of sand? Well according to this <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Wentworth-Grain-Size-Chart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">delightful chart</a>, “sand” can mean a lot of things. 7.3 billion “very coarse” grains (about 2mm in diameter) would fill a large cubic room with a height of 4m (13ft). 7.3 billion medium-size grains (.25mm in diameter) would fill a medium, 46cm high (1.5ft) cardboard box. And 7.3 billion of the finest, .0625mm sand grains (any smaller and it wouldn’t be sand anymore—it would be silt) would take up about 1,700 cubic centimeters of space, almost but not quite filling a 2-liter soda bottle.</p><p>Also, walking 7.3 billion steps would take you around the Earth…150 times. (At two steps per second, that would take you 115 years.) (I’m doing that thing where I’m going on divergent math spirals during the post and then just putting what I figured out into the actual post. I’ll try to stay on topic here but it won’t be easy. Let’s keep going.)</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><b>7.3 billion humans in one-dimensional configurations</b></span></p><p>The first activity today will be putting all humans in a single file line. We’ll start near Quito, Ecuador, right on the equator, and the line will follow the equator. We’ll begin with Carlos.

Third is you, Andrea.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3475\" id=\"note-1-3475\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> Since we’re trying to be efficient, I want everyone to stand as close as possible to the people in front of you and behind you without actually touching. Some people will require more or less space than others because people are different sizes, but let’s assume each person we add to the line will make the line one foot (about 30cm) longer on average.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3475\" id=\"note-2-3475\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carlos-and-Others.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3504 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carlos-and-Others.png\" alt=\"Carlos and Others\" width=\"647\" height=\"360\" /></a></p><p>So we do this for a while and the line gets longer and longer. We build bridges over oceans and tunnels through mountains to make a clean line along the equator. Eventually, the line goes around the whole Earth gets back to Carlos. But we’ve only gotten through 131 million people—less than 2% of humans—so we’ll need to wind around the Earth again. And again. Finally, halfway through the 56th loop, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, we get to the final human, and we’re done.</p><p>Okay that kind of annoyed me because it ended up in the shape of spring, not a line. Let’s try another way.</p><p>Carlos, stand on the X again. We’re gonna have Daniela stand on your shoulders, and then Andrea’s gonna stand on hers, and we’ll just keep going up from there.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tower.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3502 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tower.png\" alt=\"Tower\" width=\"300\" height=\"598\" /></a></p><p>The average human is 165cm (5’5″) tall, but about a foot of that is from the shoulders to the top of the head, so when we add someone onto the top person’s shoulders, the height of the tower rises by an average of about 134cm (4’5″).</p><p>We stack and stack and eventually, we reach the moon. Unfortunately, we’ve only used 286 million people at this point and have 96% of humans still left to go. By the time we finally finish, the tower is 9.8 million km (6.1m miles) high, and we’re around 1/5th of the way to Mars, 1/4th of the way to Venus, and 1/15th of the way to the sun.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3475\" id=\"note2-2-3475\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>How about if we all held hands and formed a huge circle?

Doing so gives each of them an average of one 33cm x 33cm (13″ x 13″) square to stand in. You can see in the video that while it’s definitely tight, no one is forced to molest anyone else and everyone can breathe.</p><p>But that’s using all adults. The world’s <a href=\"http://world.bymap.org/MedianAge.html\" target=\"_blank\">median age</a> is 29, and the youngest billion humans tend to be quite little. The <a href=\"http://kelvinroadschool.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-many-children-fit-into-square-metre.html\" target=\"_blank\">second case</a> brings us across the world to a random New Zealand elementary school, where a teacher has decided to get cute and cram as many kids as she can into a square meter. She maxes out at a shocking <em>22 </em>kids.</p><p>Putting these two performances together, it seems reasonable to say that 10 humans per square meter is a safe estimate for what we can use as our human-bunching metric. Nine adults in the square managed fine and the addition of children into the mix should be able to easily increase that total by one to 10 (yes, some adults are much larger than average, but others are tiny—the world’s <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-12-439.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">average adult</a> is a not-that-large 62kg (137lb) person).</p></div><p>At 10 people per square meter, we can fit 1,000 people in a 10m x 10m square. A basketball court is 28m x 15m, which means we can fit 4,200 people on one, all in bounds.</p><p>We can fit 54,000 people on an American football field, which is large enough to hold the entire population of Liechtenstein or Monaco, and if we expand our field to the size of a soccer field—sorry, a <em>football pitch—</em>we can hold over 71,000 people, more than enough space to contain the population of Greenland.</p><p>Tiananmen Square is pretty huge—880m x 500m or just under half a square kilometer.</p><div id=\"attachment_3503\" style=\"width: 618px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/china-tiananmen-square-aerial.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3503\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/china-tiananmen-square-aerial.jpg\" alt=\"china-tiananmen-square-aerial\" width=\"608\" height=\"412\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: <a href=\"http://keithrhiggons.com/tiananmen-square/\" target=\"_blank\">Keith Higgons</a></p></div><p><strong> </strong>If it were empty, it could hold 4.4 million people, or the entire population of Croatia, Oman, Lebanon, Panama, Moldova, Uruguay, Kuwait, Mongolia, or Lithuania.</p><p>A full square kilometer could fit 10 million people—the population of a megacity—and you could pack all 26 million Scandinavians—everyone in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3475\" id=\"note2-3-3475\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a>—into one square mile.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scandinavia.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3501 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/scandinavia.png\" alt=\"scandinavia\" width=\"600\" height=\"503\" /></a></p><p>Central Park, with an area of 3.41 square km (1.3 sq mi), could easily hold the population of Australia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Peru, Venezuela, Malaysia, Nepal, Mozambique or Syria.

The entire human race in 5,000 BC, which historians estimate to be between 5 – 20 million people, would fill up at most a little over half of Central Park.</p><p>We’re just getting started, so settle in.</p><p>You could squeeze all 320 million Americans into a 5.7km x 5.7km (3.5mi x 3.5mi) square, which would take less than five hours to walk around.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Americans.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3497 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Americans.png\" alt=\"Americans\" width=\"500\" height=\"348\" /></a></p><p>And a square 10km x 10km (6.2mi x 6.2mi), or a small island about twice the size of Bermuda, could hold a <em>billion </em>people (which you could walk the perimeter of in about 8 hours). A slightly larger island, Martha’s Vineyard, has an area of 226km<sup>2</sup> and could fit all the world’s Christians on it [insert your own wisecrack here]<em>. </em>Alternatively, Martha’s Vineyard could fit the entire combined population of North America and South America…<em>and still have room for the entire population of Africa. </em>As for the world’s females, if they ever got annoyed with men and wanted to start a club, they could hold their membership-wide meetings in the 360km<sup>2</sup> Gaza Strip.</p><p>Anyway, what we really want to know is how big a piece of land we’d need to hold <em>everyone</em>—all 7.3 billion of us.

With the addition of floors, it could hold 17.6 million people. That’s big enough to fit the entire population of Dallas…plus the populations of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston.</p><p>The largest building in the world, volume-wise, is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory\" target=\"_blank\">Boeing Everett Factory</a> in Washington State. With a 900m x 495m base (which almost exactly matches the dimensions of Tiananmen Square) and a ceiling over 33m high, the factory’s volume is 13.3 million cubic meters—which we could fit all the world’s French people into with room left over for all the Belgians as well (78.7 million person capacity).</p><p>But if we’re gonna fit <em>all </em>of us into a single building, nothing currently on Earth is going to work—we have to build it ourselves.</p><p>At .165 meters per person, we’ll need a little over 1.2 billion cubic meters, or just over one cubic kilometer (1.204km<sup>3</sup> to be exact).<a href=\"#footnote-5-3475\" id=\"note-5-3475\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> This cubic building would have a side of 1.07km (about 2/3 of a mile), giving it a base of about 1.1km—a little over double the size of the Boeing Factory base—and a height of 1,070m (3,511 feet), which is 29% taller than the <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Burj_Khalifa.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Burj Khalifa</a>, the world’s tallest skyscraper.

Somewhere else are all your friends. Somewhere in there is a 16-year-old Cambodian girl and all her friends. Somewhere is a Somali pirate, his barber, and all his barber’s friends. Every NBA player is in there, along with every rockstar, movie star, supermodel, and politician. Every bartender and construction worker and priest and lawyer and prisoner and princess and soldier and dentist are somewhere in that building, along with all 1.4 billion Chinese people, every blond person, and every member of ISIS.</p><p>The human race, which seems overwhelmingly large in one dimension when it’s wrapping 55 times around the Earth or forming a circle that dwarfs the moon’s orbit, seems much more manageable when it can fit inside Bahrain or New York City with room to spare and almost quaint when organized neatly into a cube that would take you only 20 minutes to jog around.</p><p>And with that, our initial goal is accomplished. But what if, instead of ending this post here, we went just one step further? After all that work, who wants to stop now while there’s still so much empty space in all of our atoms?</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>7.3 Billion Humans Compressed Down to Their Atomic Nuclei</strong></span></p><p>Every atom’s different, but a general ballpark rule is that an atom’s diameter is about 100,000 times larger than the diameter of its nucleus, the thing that carries nearly all of the atom’s mass. Translated into three dimensions, that means an atom’s nucleus makes up only around one <i>quadrillionth </i>of an atom’s total volume. The way I visualize this is by imagining an atom to be a cubic kilometer—a hollow cube taller than the tallest skyscraper (around the size of our humanity cube above). This building is so large that if you were inside it, hanging from the ceiling, and you let go, it would take you about 15 seconds of free fall before you hit the ground. If you’re standing on one side of the base, it would take you about 12 minutes to walk across to the other.</p><p>If that huge cube is an atom, somewhere in the middle is a 1 cm<sup>3</sup> <em>sugar cube—</em>and that’s the nucleus. And the atom’s mass would be about exactly the mass of the sugar cube, which takes up one quadrillionth of the total space. Just about all of the other 999,999,999,999,999 quadrillionths of the atom is massless, empty space.</p><p>Your body’s mass is the combined masses of the sugar cubes in the middle of each of your body’s atoms.</p><p>So how big is the human race <em>really</em>? When we get rid of the empty space in all the atoms of all 7.3 billion people, what are we left with?</p><p>An M&amp;M.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MM1.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3508 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MM1.png\" alt=\"M&amp;M\" width=\"168\" height=\"156\" /></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not even, actually. The volume of a human is about .0664 cubic meters, putting the combined volume of all humans at about 485 million cubic meters. When we reduce that to one quadrillionth of its size, we get .485 cubic centimeters. An M&amp;M is .636cm<sup>3</sup>, about 30% too large. A Skittle is too large too (.74cm<sup>3</sup>), as are a quarter (.809cm<sup>3</sup>) and a nickel (.689cm<sup>3</sup>). It’s pretty hard to find everyday objects as small as .485cm<sup>3</sup> (a US penny works, but at .433cm<sup>3</sup>, falls just short of fitting us all in it).</p><p>And that’s where we’ll end things today. With an M&amp;M weighing 450 million tonnes—heavier than 75 Pyramids of Giza—that we could all fit into if someone squished us hard enough.</p><p>___________</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>If you liked this post, here are four more posts in the Pointless Calculations category:</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/03/combined-wealth-world.html\">What Could You Buy With $241 Trillion?</a> More cubes.

The <a href=\"http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/\" target=\"_blank\">world population</a> has grown by 194,000,000, or almost 3%, since then.</p><p>Second, 7.3 billion people is a lot of people. If each living human were represented by a dry grain of rice, the rice would fill a cube-shaped box with a side of 6.1 meters,<a href=\"#footnote2-1-3475\" id=\"note2-1-3475\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> or about 20 feet—around the size of a two-story house.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rice.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3500 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rice.png\" alt=\"Rice\" width=\"651\" height=\"360\" /></a></p><p>That&#8217;s a lot of rice grains.</p><p>And how about 7.3 billion grains of sand? Well according to this <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Wentworth-Grain-Size-Chart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">delightful chart</a>, &#8220;sand&#8221; can mean a lot of things. 7.3 billion &#8220;very coarse&#8221; grains (about 2mm in diameter) would fill a large cubic room with a height of 4m (13ft). 7.3 billion medium-size grains (.25mm in diameter) would fill a medium, 46cm high (1.5ft) cardboard box. And 7.3 billion of the finest, .0625mm sand grains (any smaller and it wouldn&#8217;t be sand anymore—it would be silt) would take up about 1,700 cubic centimeters of space, almost but not quite filling a 2-liter soda bottle.</p><p>Also, walking 7.3 billion steps would take you around the Earth&#8230;150 times. (At two steps per second, that would take you 115 years.) (I&#8217;m doing that thing where I&#8217;m going on divergent math spirals during the post and then just putting what I figured out into the actual post. I&#8217;ll try to stay on topic here but it won&#8217;t be easy. Let&#8217;s keep going.)</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><b>7.3 billion humans in one-dimensional configurations</b></span></p><p>The first activity today will be putting all humans in a single file line.

It’s not for everyone—but I’d click the shit out of that headline if I saw it on Facebook.</p><p>This year, I’ve gone a different direction. I’ve created <em>one of the least clickable headlines in the history of the internet. </em></p><p>Here’s what the full scale looks like:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/clickbait2.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3454 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/clickbait2.png\" alt=\"clickbait\" width=\"550\" height=\"497\" /></a></p><p>So forgive me if I’m a little confused why you’re here right now—why you’re voluntarily involving yourself in a piece of writing that will focus on Andrew Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, and William McKinley.</p><p>Maybe you clicked on this by accident while trying to click “Hide all posts from Wait But Why.” Or maybe, just maybe, you’re like me and you have a morbid fascination with this group of <em>eight consecutive presidents</em><em>who no one has heard of.</em> Sure, you know a bit about Grant. You know Johnson was impeached. You might know Garfield and McKinley were assassinated. But unless you’re a history buff, that’s about all you know. I’m pretty into history, and that was about all I knew.</p><p>So I decided to dig in—way more in depth than I dug into the first 16—to the abyss between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. Because if we’re gonna do this—we’re gonna really do this.</p><p>Three notes before we start:</p><p><strong>1) Here’s this chart again:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PartyVotes-Presidents.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3433\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PartyVotes-Presidents.png\" alt=\"PartyVotes-Presidents\" width=\"797\" height=\"364\" /></a></p><p>You can see that after the political chaos of the first 16 presidencies (a time period which constitutes both what historians call <em>The First Party System</em>—up through Quincy Adams—and <em>The Second Party System</em>—from Jackson to Pierce), things settle down into a clean Republican vs. Democrat divide. The period we’ll cover in this post is 36 years long, running from the Civil War to the dawn of the 20th Century—a period Mark Twain first called The Gilded Age.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3429\" id=\"note-1-3429\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><p>The politics of this period are what historians call <em>The Third Party System</em>—and in this system, there are Republicans and Democrats, which sounds familiar, but those parties barely resemble those same two parties today. If anything, the Republicans of The Gilded Age may have more in common with today’s Democrats and the Democrats of that time may better resemble today’s Republicans (although of course, it’s blurry, and both parties back then contain a mix of the two parties today, as well as having certain characteristics that don’t exist today at all, which makes comparisons of then vs. now a bit of an apples-to-oranges situation).</p><p>As you can see on the chart, the Gilded Age Republicans, who made up most of the Civil War’s victorious North, largely dominated the era.</p><p><strong>2) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s the chart</a> that shows the aggregation of historians’ rankings of the presidents.</strong> Of course, even the aggregate ranks are totally subjective and not at all definitive—but I believe it’s the best way to give each president a ranking that reflects the general scholarly consensus on how the presidents stack up against each other. The aggregate column in that chart is where I draw my rankings from below each president’s name.</p><p>And how does this post’s group fare in the rankings? <em>None </em>of the eight presidents crack the top 18. What a crew.</p><p><strong>3) This is a critical time to refresh yourself on the Mustache Era.</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mustache.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3434\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mustache.png\" alt=\"Mustache\" width=\"756\" height=\"94\" /></a></p><p>The Mustache Era is an unprecedented time in American history, during which presidential mustaches were rampant. And never before or after the mustache era was there <em>any </em>other presidential mustache. The Gilded Age that we’ll be covering today overlaps almost entirely with the Mustache Era.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3429\" id=\"note-2-3429\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a><p>And now it’s time to buckle up and hold on tight as I take you on a whirlwind tour of eight of the most random men in the world. We start in April, 1865. The Civil War has just ended, Lincoln has just been shot, and the country is in total mayhem…</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 36px;\"><strong>17) Andrew Johnson</strong></span></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Johnson.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3450 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Johnson.png\" alt=\"Johnson\" width=\"340\" height=\"278\" /></a></p><p><strong>Presidency:</strong> 1865 – 1869 <strong>Lived:</strong> 1808 – 1875 <strong>Ranking:</strong> 41/43</p><p><strong>Mustache?</strong> No.</p><p><strong>His Deal: </strong>Born in a super-poor log cabin situation in North Carolina, Johnson was raised by a single mom and apprenticed as a tailor before doing the most stereotypical politics ladder climb ever, going from city alderman to city mayor to state House to state Senate to federal Congress to Tennessee governor to federal Senate to vice president to president.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3429\" id=\"note-3-3429\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> Satisfying. Johnson capped off his epic journey by making the odd decision to stand on the top rung of the ladder being a dick for four years and followed that up by plunging all the way back down to the ground in disgrace. He spent the rest of his life losing small elections before finally winning a Senate seat four months before dying. Of his late-life Senate win, Johnson remarked, “Thank God for this vindication,” which was a weird thing to say since today he’s known as the third worst president in US history and mostly just comes up as the answer to the pre-1998 trivia question, “Who is the only US president to be impeached?”</p><p><strong>His Presidency: </strong>Johnson was chosen to be Lincoln’s running mate in 1864 (before Lincoln’s second term) because he was a rare combo: a politician from the South (Tennessee) and one of Lincoln’s rival Democrats, but one who was also fervently pro-Union and anti-secession—this made him the perfect choice to help Lincoln win the election and send the message of cross-party and cross-region collaboration and national unity. Six weeks after winning the election, Johnson and Lincoln held their first and last meeting as president and vice president, because that night, Lincoln was shot.</p><p>New President Johnson inherited a nation that had <em>just </em>come out of Civil War. The smoke was still clearing and the plan had been for Lincoln to spend his second term making a trillion critical decisions for the future of the country. With a clear winner to the war, and one party, Lincoln’s Republicans, in an unusual position of power, it was a rare opportunity to reshape the nation for the future and finally shed off the conflicts of the past, like slavery, that had plagued the country since its beginning. And Lincoln would <em>really </em>have been a great person to do that.</p><p>Instead, the hypercharged Republicans were suddenly led by a Southern Democrat, who it turns out didn’t really agree with much of what Lincoln had planned to do for the post-war Reconstruction effort. Johnson spent the next four years doing everything he could to get in the way of major Republican progress. The Republicans wanted to be tough with the South, punishing prominent Confederate politicians and refusing to offer reconstruction aid until Southern states agreed to grant equal rights and citizenship to newly-freed slaves—but Johnson vetoed most of the bills that the Republican Congress tried to pass, including the Civil Rights Bill, arguing that it gave “a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union.” He wrote, in a letter to a governor, “this is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men.” Lincoln would have been proud.</p><p>The Republicans, who despised Johnson, successfully impeached him in 1868, claiming he had acted outside the president’s legal boundaries on several occasions—and at his impeachment trial, they fell one vote short of ousting him from office. The next year, he got crushed in his own primary and never even had a chance to run for a second term.</p><p>Johnson’s presidency ties with Buchanan’s for most maddening to read about.</p><p><strong>Things He Can Brag About: </strong></p><ul><li>Being the only president to serve in the Senate after his presidency</li><li>Alaska is Johnson’s doing. His Secretary of State, William Seward, bought it from Russia for $7.2 million ($121 million in today’s dollars). At the time, Americans viewed this as a terrible deal and the whole thing was referred to, for a while, as “Seward’s Folly.”</li></ul><p><strong>Things He Hopes We Don’t Remember: </strong></p><ul><li>His white supremacist quote I included above</li><li>In what is definitely the funniest thing I’ve read so far in my research on the first 24 presidents, Johnson, at his and Lincoln’s 1864 inauguration, showed up at the event <em>hammered </em>and proceeded to make a complete debacle of a long, rambling, drunken speech as Lincoln and the entire Senate Chamber looked on in shock. A Senator who attended said afterwards, “I was never so mortified in my life—had I been able to find a hole I would have dropped through it out of sight.” Johnson then disappeared into reclusion for six weeks to avoid public ridicule.</li><li>He owned about nine slaves before becoming vice president, and is rumored to have fathered children with one of them.</li></ul><p><strong>Things He’s Annoyed About:</strong></p><ul><li>Apparently he celebrated his 60th birthday by having a party for several hundred children, which sounds like an incredibly unfun party and something that definitely wasn’t his idea.</li><li>Clinton’s impeachment. Until 1998, the <em>one </em>thing everyone knew about him is that he was the only president to be impeached. Clinton took away Johnson’s one major distinction.</li></ul><p><strong>Other Notable Facts: </strong></p><ul><li>After his time as a tailor’s apprentice, Johnson would forever make his own clothing, even while president.</li><li>He looks <a href=\"http://randomoverload.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/b293my-lee-jones-totally-looks-like-andrew-johnson.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">hilariously</a><a href=\"http://cdn3.everyjoe.com/wp-content/gallery/celebrity-lookalikes/andrew-johnson-tommy-lee-jones.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">similar</a> to Tommy Lee Jones.</li><li>Civil War general and next president Ulysses S. Grant had a major falling out with Johnson during Johnson’s presidency, presumably because of Johnson’s whole “trying to undo all the progress of the Civil War” thing. Grant wouldn’t allow his kids to attend Johnson’s 60th birthday party, and Johnson refused to attend Grant’s inauguration.</li><li>Lincoln’s assassination was actually supposed to be part of a three-assassination trifecta, all in the same night. Two of Booth’s co-conspirators had plans to shoot VP Johnson and Secretary of State Seward. The attempt on Seward nearly succeeded, injuring him badly. But apparently Johnson’s would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, didn’t even attempt to kill Johnson because he <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Atzerodt\" target=\"_blank\">got drunk instead</a>. Pretty funny picturing Booth walking into Atzerodt’s apartment the next day and asking what the <em>hell</em> happened and Atzerodt being like, “Huh? OOOOHHH SHIT…oh RIGHT….shit I am SO sorry man, totally slipped my mind.”</li></ul><p><strong>Last Words: </strong>After having a stroke and falling off his chair: “My right side is paralyzed. I need no doctor. I can overcome my troubles.” He couldn’t.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/02/american-presidents-johnson-mckinley/2\"><span style=\"font-size: 28px;\">Next (Ulysses S.

We then examined why it was such a huge challenge to get from ANI to Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI (AI that’s at least as intellectually capable as a human, across the board), and we discussed why the exponential rate of technological advancement we’ve seen in the past suggests that AGI might not be as far away as it seems.

Often, someone’s first thought when they imagine a super-smart computer is one that’s as intelligent as a human but can think much, much <em>faster</em><a href=\"#footnote-2-3269\" id=\"note-2-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a>—they might picture a machine that thinks like a human, except a million times quicker, which means it could figure out in five minutes what would take a human a decade.</p><p>That sounds impressive, and ASI <em>would</em> think much faster than any human could—but the true separator would be its advantage in intelligence <em>quality</em>, which is something completely different. What makes humans so much more intellectually capable than chimps isn’t a difference in thinking speed—it’s that human brains contain a number of sophisticated cognitive modules that enable things like complex linguistic representations or longterm planning or abstract reasoning, that chimps’ brains do not. Speeding up a chimp’s brain by thousands of times wouldn’t bring him to our level—even with a decade’s time, he wouldn’t be able to figure out how to use a set of custom tools to assemble an intricate model, something a human could knock out in a few hours. There are worlds of human cognitive function a chimp will simply never be capable of, no matter how much time he spends trying.</p><p>But it’s not just that a chimp can’t do what we do, it’s that his brain is unable to grasp that those worlds even <em>exist—</em>a chimp can become familiar with what a human is and what a skyscraper is, but he’ll never be able to understand that the skyscraper was <em>built</em><em>by</em> humans. In his world, anything that huge is part of nature, period, and not only is it beyond him to build a skyscraper, it’s beyond him to <em>realize that</em><em>anyone can build a skyscraper.</em> That’s the result of a small difference in intelligence quality.</p><p>And in the scheme of the intelligence range we’re talking about today, or even the much smaller range among biological creatures, the chimp-to-human quality intelligence gap is <em>tiny</em>. In an earlier <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>, I depicted the range of biological cognitive capacity using a staircase:<a href=\"#footnote-3-3269\" id=\"note-3-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3381\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase1.png\" alt=\"staircase\" width=\"500\" height=\"512\" /></a></p><p>To absorb how big a deal a superintelligent machine would be, imagine one on the dark green step two steps above humans on that staircase. This machine would be only <em>slightly </em>superintelligent, but its increased cognitive ability over us would be as vast as the chimp-human gap we just described. And like the chimp’s incapacity to ever absorb that skyscrapers can be built, we will never be able to even comprehend the things a machine on the dark green step can do, even if the machine tried to explain it to us—let alone do it ourselves. And that’s only two steps above us. A machine on the second-to-highest step on that staircase would be to us as we are to ants—it could try for years to teach us the simplest inkling of what it knows and the endeavor would be hopeless.</p><p>But the kind of superintelligence we’re talking about today is something far beyond anything on this staircase. In an intelligence explosion—where the smarter a machine gets, the quicker it’s able to increase its own intelligence, until it begins to <em>soar</em> upwards—a machine might take years to rise from the chimp step to the one above it, but perhaps only hours to jump up a step once it’s on the dark green step two above us, and by the time it’s ten steps above us, it might be jumping up in four-step leaps every second that goes by. Which is why we need to realize that it’s distinctly possible that very shortly after the big news story about the first machine reaching human-level AGI, we might be facing the reality of coexisting on the Earth with something that’s here on the staircase (or maybe a million times higher):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3364\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png\" alt=\"staircase2\" width=\"650\" height=\"552\" /></a></p><p>And since we just established that it’s a hopeless activity to try to understand the power of a machine only two steps above us, let’s very concretely state once and for all that <strong>there is no way to know what ASI will do or what the consequences will be for us.<i></i></strong>Anyone who pretends otherwise doesn’t understand what superintelligence means.</p><p>Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we’ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is <em>part </em>of evolution—maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it’s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tripwire.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3370\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tripwire.png\" alt=\"Tripwire\" width=\"500\" height=\"411\" /></a></p><p>And for reasons we’ll discuss later, a huge part of the scientific community believes that it’s not a matter of whether we’ll hit that tripwire, but when. Kind of a crazy piece of information.</p><p>So where does that leave us?</p><p>Well no one in the world, especially not I, can tell you what will happen when we hit the tripwire. But Oxford philosopher and lead AI thinker Nick Bostrom believes we can boil down all potential outcomes into two broad categories.</p><p>First, looking at history, we can see that life works like this: species pop up, exist for a while, and after some time, inevitably, they fall off the existence balance beam and land on extinction—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3358\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam1.png\" alt=\"beam1\" width=\"552\" height=\"352\" /></a></p><p>“All species eventually go extinct” has been almost as reliable a rule through history as “All humans eventually die” has been. So far, 99.9% of species have fallen off the balance beam, and it seems pretty clear that if a species keeps wobbling along down the beam, it’s only a matter of time before some other species, some gust of nature’s wind, or a sudden beam-shaking asteroid knocks it off. Bostrom calls extinction an <em>attractor state</em>—a place species are all teetering on falling into and from which no species ever returns.</p><p>And while most scientists I’ve come across acknowledge that ASI would have the ability to send humans to extinction, many also believe that used beneficially, ASI’s abilities could be used to bring individual humans, and the species as a whole, to a <em>second</em> attractor state—species immortality. Bostrom believes species immortality is just as much of an attractor state as species extinction, i.e. if we manage to get there, we’ll be impervious to extinction forever—we’ll have conquered mortality and conquered chance. So even though all species <em>so far </em>have fallen off the balance beam and landed on extinction, Bostrom believes there are two sides to the beam and it’s just that nothing on Earth has been intelligent enough yet to figure out how to fall off on the other side.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3389\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam2.jpg\" alt=\"beam2\" width=\"551\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p>If Bostrom and others are right, and from everything I’ve read, it seems like they really might be, we have two pretty shocking facts to absorb:</p><p><strong>1) The advent of ASI will, for the first time, open up the possibility for a species to land on the immortality side of the balance beam.</strong></p><p><strong>2) The advent of ASI will make such an unimaginably dramatic impact that it’s likely to knock the human race off the beam, in one direction or the other. </strong></p><p>It may very well be that when evolution hits the tripwire, it permanently ends humans’ relationship with the beam and creates a new world, with or without humans.</p><p>Kind of seems like the only question any human should currently be asking is: <em>When are we going to hit the tripwire and which side of the beam will we land on when that happens?</em></p><p>No one in the world knows the answer to either part of that question, but a lot of the very smartest people have put decades of thought into it. We’ll spend the rest of this post exploring what they’ve come up with.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let’s start with the first part of the question: <em>When are we going to hit the tripwire?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">i.e. How long until the first machine reaches superintelligence?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not shockingly, opinions vary wildly and this is a heated debate among scientists and thinkers. Many, like professor <a href=\"https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vernor Vinge</a>, scientist <a href=\"http://goertzel.org/TenYearsToTheSingularity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Goertzel</a>, Sun Microsystems co-founder <a href=\"http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Joy</a>, or, most famously, inventor and futurist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Kurzweil</a>, agree with machine learning expert Jeremy Howard when he puts up this graph during a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a>:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Howard-Graph.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3361\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Howard-Graph.png\" alt=\"Howard Graph\" width=\"550\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Those people subscribe to the belief that this is happening <em>soon—</em>that exponential growth is at work and machine learning, though only slowly creeping up on us now, will blow right past us within the next few decades.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Others, like Microsoft co-founder <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Allen</a>, research psychologist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hyping-artificial-intelligence-yet-again\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Marcus</a>, NYU computer scientist <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/568\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Davis</a>, and tech entrepreneur <a href=\"http://longbets.org/1/\" target=\"_blank\">Mitch Kapor</a>, believe that thinkers like Kurzweil are <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/\" target=\"_blank\">vastly underestimating</a> the magnitude of the challenge and believe that we’re not actually that close to the tripwire.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Kurzweil camp would <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425818/kurzweil-responds-dont-underestimate-the-singularity/\" target=\"_blank\">counter</a> that the only underestimating that’s happening is the underappreciation of exponential growth, and they’d compare the doubters to those who looked at the slow-growing seedling of the internet in 1985 and argued that there was no way it would amount to anything impactful in the near future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The doubters might argue back that the progress needed to make advancements in intelligence <em>also</em> grows exponentially harder with each subsequent step, which will cancel out the typical exponential nature of technological progress. And so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A third camp, which includes <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199678111&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=LBOTX2G2R72P5EUA\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Bostrom</a>, believes neither group has any ground to feel certain about the timeline and acknowledges both A) that this could absolutely happen in the near future and B) that there’s no guarantee about that; it could also take a much longer time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still others, like philosopher <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262540673/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262540673&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=ZHBAVUQOM6SIGYHG\" target=\"_blank\">Hubert Dreyfus</a>, believe all three of these groups are naive for believing that there even is a tripwire, arguing that it’s more likely that ASI won’t actually ever be achieved.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So what do you get when you put all of these opinions together?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2013, Vincent C. Müller and Nick Bostrom conducted a survey that asked hundreds of AI experts at a series of conferences the following question: “For the purposes of this question, assume that human scientific activity continues without major negative disruption. By what year would you see a (10% / 50% / 90%) probability for such HLMI<a href=\"#footnote-4-3269\" id=\"note-4-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> to exist?” It asked them to name an optimistic year (one in which they believe there’s a 10% chance we’ll have AGI), a realistic guess (a year they believe there’s a 50% chance of AGI—i.e. after that year they think it’s more likely than not that we’ll have AGI), and a safe guess (the earliest year by which they can say with 90% certainty we’ll have AGI). Gathered together as one data set, here were the results:<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3269\" id=\"note2-2-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Median optimistic year (10% likelihood):<strong> 2022<br /></strong>Median realistic year (50% likelihood):<strong><strong> 2040</strong><br /></strong>Median pessimistic year (90% likelihood):<strong><strong> 2075</strong><br /></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So the median participant thinks it’s more likely than not that we’ll have AGI 25 years from now. The 90% median answer of 2075 means that if you’re a teenager right now, the median respondent, along with over half of the group of AI experts, is almost certain AGI will happen within your lifetime.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A separate study, conducted recently by author James Barrat at Ben Goertzel’s annual AGI Conference, did away with percentages and simply asked when participants thought AGI would be achieved—by 2030, by 2050, by 2100, after 2100, or never. The results:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3269\" id=\"note2-3-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">By 2030: <strong>42% of respondents<br /></strong>By 2050: <strong>25%</strong><br />
By 2100: <b>20%<br /></b>After 2100: <strong>10%</strong><br />
Never: <strong>2%</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pretty similar to Müller and Bostrom’s outcomes. In Barrat’s survey, over two thirds of participants believe AGI will be here by 2050 and a little less than half predict AGI within the next 15 years. Also striking is that only 2% of those surveyed don’t think AGI is part of our future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But AGI isn’t the tripwire, ASI is. So when do the experts think we’ll reach ASI?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Müller and Bostrom also asked the experts how likely they think it is that we’ll reach ASI A) within two years of reaching AGI (i.e. an almost-immediate intelligence explosion), and B) within 30 years. The results:<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3269\" id=\"note2-4-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The median answer put a rapid (2 year) AGI → ASI transition at only a <strong>10%</strong> likelihood, but a longer transition of 30 years or less at a <strong>75%</strong> likelihood.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We don’t know from this data the length of this transition the median participant would have put at a 50% likelihood, but for ballpark purposes, based on the two answers above, let’s estimate that they’d have said 20 years. So the median opinion—the one right in the center of the world of AI experts—believes the most realistic guess for when we’ll hit the ASI tripwire is [the 2040 prediction for AGI + our estimated prediction of a 20-year transition from AGI to ASI] <strong>= 2060</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Timeline.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3365\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Timeline.png\" alt=\"Timeline\" width=\"550\" height=\"287\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, all of the above statistics are speculative, and they’re only representative of the center opinion of the AI expert community, but it tells us that a large portion of the people who know the most about this topic would agree that 2060 is a very reasonable estimate for the arrival of potentially world-altering ASI. Only 45 years from now.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Okay now how about the second part of the question above: <em>When we hit the tripwire, which side of the beam will we fall to?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Superintelligence will yield tremendous power—the critical question for us is:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Who or what will be in control of that power, and what will their motivation be?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The answer to this will determine whether ASI is an unbelievably great development, an unfathomably terrible development, or something in between.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, the expert community is again all over the board and in a heated debate about the answer to this question. Müller and Bostrom’s survey asked participants to assign a probability to the possible impacts AGI would have on humanity and found that the mean response was that there was <strong>a</strong><strong>52% chance that the outcome will be either good or extremely good and a 31% chance the outcome will be either bad or extremely bad. </strong>For a relatively neutral outcome, the mean probability was only 17%. In other words, the people who know the most about this are pretty sure this will be a huge deal. It’s also worth noting that those numbers refer to the advent of <em>AGI—</em>if the question were about ASI, I imagine that the neutral percentage would be even lower.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before we dive much further into this good vs. bad outcome part of the question, let’s combine both the “when will it happen?” and the “will it be good or bad?” parts of this question into a chart that encompasses the views of most of the relevant experts:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3377\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square11.jpg\" alt=\"Square1\" width=\"675\" height=\"1144\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We’ll talk more about the Main Camp in a minute, but first—what’s your deal? Actually I know what your deal is, because it was my deal too before I started researching this topic. Some reasons most people aren’t really thinking about this topic:</p><ul><li style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned in Part 1, movies have really confused things by presenting unrealistic AI scenarios that make us feel like AI isn’t something to be taken seriously in general. James Barrat compares the situation to our reaction if the Centers for Disease Control issued a serious warning about vampires in our future.<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3269\" id=\"note2-5-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a></li><li style=\"text-align: left;\">Due to something called <em>cognitive biases</em>, we have a hard time believing something is real until we see proof. I’m sure computer scientists in 1988 were regularly talking about how big a deal the internet was likely to be, but people probably didn’t <em>really </em>think it was going to change their lives until it actually changed their lives. This is partially because computers just couldn’t do stuff like that in 1988, so people would look at their computer and think, “Really? <em>That’s</em> gonna be a life changing thing?” Their imaginations were limited to what their personal experience had taught them about what a computer was, which made it very hard to vividly picture what computers might <em>become</em>. The same thing is happening now with AI. We hear that it’s gonna be a big deal, but because it hasn’t happened yet, and because of our experience with the relatively impotent AI in our current world, we have a hard time <em>really </em>believing this is going to change our lives dramatically. And those biases are what experts are up against as they frantically try to get our attention through the noise of collective daily self-absorption.</li><li style=\"text-align: left;\">Even if we did believe it—how many times today have you thought about the fact that you’ll spend most of the rest of eternity not existing? Not many, right? Even though it’s a far more intense fact than anything else you’re doing today? This is because our brains are normally focused on the little things in day-to-day life, no matter <em>how </em>crazy a long-term situation we’re a part of. It’s just how we’re wired.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the goals of these two posts is to get you out of the I Like to Think About Other Things Camp and into one of the expert camps, even if you’re just standing on the intersection of the two dotted lines in the square above, totally uncertain.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During my research, I came across dozens of varying opinions on this topic, but I quickly noticed that most people’s opinions fell somewhere in what I labeled the Main Camp, and in particular, over three quarters of the experts fell into two Subcamps inside the Main Camp:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3384\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square21.jpg\" alt=\"Square2\" width=\"600\" height=\"593\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We’re gonna take a thorough dive into both of these camps.

They have their sights set on the fun side of the balance beam and they’re convinced that’s where all of us are headed. For them, the future is everything they ever could have hoped for, just in time.</p><p class=\"p1\">The thing that separates these people from the other thinkers we’ll discuss later isn’t their lust for the happy side of the beam—it’s their confidence that that’s the side we’re going to land on.</p><p class=\"p1\">Where this confidence comes from is up for debate. Critics believe it comes from an excitement so blinding that they simply ignore or deny potential negative outcomes. But the believers say it’s naive to conjure up doomsday scenarios when on balance, technology has and will likely end up continuing to help us a lot more than it hurts us.</p><p class=\"p1\">We’ll cover both sides, and you can form your own opinion about this as you read, but for this section, put your skepticism away and let’s take a good hard look at what’s over there on the fun side of the balance beam—and try to absorb the fact that the things you’re reading <em>might really happen</em>. If you had shown a hunter-gatherer our world of indoor comfort, technology, and endless abundance, it would have seemed like fictional magic to him—we have to be humble enough to acknowledge that it’s <em>possible</em> that an equally inconceivable transformation could be in our future.</p><p class=\"p1\">Nick Bostrom describes three ways a superintelligent AI system could function:<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3269\" id=\"note2-6-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><ul><li class=\"p1\">As an <strong>oracle</strong>, which answers nearly any question posed to it with accuracy, including complex questions that humans cannot easily answer—i.e. <em>How can I manufacture a more efficient car engine?</em> Google is a primitive type of oracle.</li><li class=\"p1\">As a <strong>genie</strong><em>,</em> which executes any high-level command it’s given—<em>Use a molecular assembler to build a new and more efficient kind of car engine</em>—and then awaits its next command.</li><li class=\"p1\">As a <strong>sovereign</strong>, which is assigned a broad and open-ended pursuit and allowed to operate in the world freely, making its own decisions about how best to proceed—<i>Invent a faster, cheaper, and safer way than cars for humans to privately transport themselves.</i></li></ul><p>These questions and tasks, which seem complicated to us, would sound to a superintelligent system like someone asking you to improve upon the “My pencil fell off the table” situation, which you’d do by picking it up and putting it back on the table.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.yudkowsky.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>, a resident of Anxious Avenue in our chart above, said it well:</p><blockquote><p>There are no hard problems, only problems that are hard to a certain level of intelligence. Move the smallest bit upwards [in level of intelligence], and some problems will suddenly move from “impossible” to “obvious.” Move a substantial degree upwards, and all of them will become obvious.<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3269\" id=\"note2-7-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a></blockquote><p>There are a lot of eager scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs in Confident Corner—but for a tour of brightest side of the AI horizon, there’s only one person we want as our tour guide.</p><p>Ray Kurzweil is polarizing. In my reading, I heard everything from godlike worship of him and his ideas to eye-rolling contempt for them. Others were somewhere in the middle—author Douglas Hofstadter, in discussing the ideas in Kurzweil’s books, eloquently put forth that “it is as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can’t possibly figure out what’s good or bad.”<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3269\" id=\"note2-8-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p>Whether you like his ideas or not, everyone agrees that Kurzweil is impressive. He began inventing things as a teenager and in the following decades, he came up with several breakthrough inventions, including <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">the first flatbed scanner, the first scanner that converted text to speech (allowing the blind to read standard texts), the well-known Kurzweil music synthesizer (the first true electric piano), and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. He’s the author of five national bestselling books. He’s well-known for his bold predictions and has a <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/why-ray-kurzweils-predictions-are-right-86-of-the-time\" target=\"_blank\">pretty good record</a> of having them come true—including his prediction in the late ’80s, a time when the internet was an obscure thing, that by the early 2000s, it would become a global phenomenon. Kurzweil has been called a “restless genius” by The Wall Street Journal, “the ultimate thinking machine” by Forbes, “Edison’s rightful heir” by Inc. Magazine, and “</span>the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence” by Bill Gates.<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3269\" id=\"note2-9-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> In 2012, Google co-founder Larry Page approached Kurzweil and asked him to be Google’s Director of Engineering.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3269\" id=\"note-5-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> In 2011, he co-founded <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Singularity University</a>, which is hosted by NASA and sponsored partially by Google. Not bad for one life.</p><p>This biography is important. When Kurzweil articulates his vision of the future, he sounds fully like a crackpot, and the crazy thing is that he’s not—he’s an extremely smart, knowledgeable, relevant man in the world. You may think he’s wrong about the future, but he’s not a fool. Knowing he’s a such a legit dude makes me <em>happy</em>, because as I’ve learned about his predictions for the future, I <em>badly </em>want him to be right. And you do too. As you hear Kurzweil’s predictions, many shared by other Confident Corner thinkers like <a href=\"http://www.diamandis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Diamandis</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Goertzel</a>, it’s not hard to see why he has such a large, passionate following—known as the singularitarians. Here’s what he thinks is going to happen:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Timeline</strong></span></p><p>Kurzweil believes computers will reach AGI by 2029 and that by 2045, we’ll have not only ASI, but a full-blown new world—a time he calls the singularity. His AI-related timeline used to be seen as outrageously overzealous, and it still is by many,<a href=\"#footnote-6-3269\" id=\"note-6-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> but in the last 15 years, the rapid advances of ANI systems have brought the larger world of AI experts much closer to Kurzweil’s timeline. His predictions are still a bit more ambitious than the median respondent on Müller and Bostrom’s survey (AGI by 2040, ASI by 2060), but not by that much.</p><p>Kurzweil’s depiction of the 2045 singularity is brought about by three simultaneous revolutions in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and, most powerfully, AI.</p><p>Before we move on—nanotechnology comes up in almost everything you read about the future of AI, so come into this blue box for a minute so we can discuss it—</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Nanotechnology Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>Nanotechnology is our word for technology that deals with the manipulation of matter that’s between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter, and this 1-100 range encompasses viruses (100 nm across), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as large molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).<a href=\"#footnote-7-3269\" id=\"note-7-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a><p>To understand the challenge of humans trying to manipulate matter in that range, let’s take the same thing on a larger scale. The International Space Station is 268 mi (431 km) above the Earth. If humans were giants so large their heads reached up to the ISS, they’d be about 250,000 times bigger than they are now. If you make the 1nm – 100nm nanotech range 250,000 times bigger, you get .25mm – 2.5cm. So nanotechnology is the equivalent of a human giant as tall as the ISS figuring out how to carefully build intricate objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand and an eyeball. To reach the next level—manipulating individual atoms—the giant would have to carefully position objects that are 1/40th of a millimeter—so small normal-size humans would need a microscope to see them.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3269\" id=\"note-8-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><p>Nanotech was first discussed by Richard Feynman in a 1959 talk, when he explained: “The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It would be, in principle, possible … for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down…. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.” It’s as simple as that. If you can figure out how to move individual molecules or atoms around, you can make literally anything.</p><p>Nanotech became a serious field for the first time in 1986, when engineer Eric Drexler provided its foundations in his seminal book <i>Engines of Creation, </i>but Drexler suggests that those looking to learn about the most modern ideas in nanotechnology would be best off reading his 2013 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610391136/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1610391136&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=AIDAWXXXQCHLBDCU\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radical Abundance</em></a>.</p><div class=\"wbwAside2\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Gray Goo Bluer Box</strong></span></p><p>We’re now in a diversion <em>in a diversion</em>. This is very fun.<a href=\"#footnote-9-3269\" id=\"note-9-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a><p>Anyway, I brought you here because there’s this really unfunny part of nanotechnology lore I need to tell you about. In older versions of nanotech theory, a proposed method of nanoassembly involved the creation of trillions of tiny nanobots that would work in conjunction to build something. One way to create trillions of nanobots would be to make one that could self-replicate and then let the reproduction process turn that one into two, those two then turn into four, four into eight, and in about a day, there’d be a few trillion of them ready to go. That’s the power of exponential growth. Clever, right?</p><p>It’s clever until it causes the grand and complete Earthwide apocalypse by accident. The issue is that the same power of exponential growth that makes it super convenient to quickly create a trillion nanobots makes self-replication a <em>terrifying </em>prospect. Because what if the system glitches, and instead of stopping replication once the total hits a few trillion as expected, they just keep replicating? The nanobots would be designed to consume any carbon-based material in order to feed the replication process, and unpleasantly, all life is carbon-based. The Earth’s biomass contains about 10<sup>45</sup> carbon atoms. A nanobot would consist of about 10<sup>6</sup> carbon atoms, so 10<sup>39</sup> nanobots would consume all life on Earth, which would happen in 130 replications (2<sup>130</sup> is about 10<sup>39</sup>), as oceans of nanobots (that’s the gray goo) rolled around the planet. Scientists think a nanobot could replicate in about 100 seconds, meaning this simple mistake would inconveniently end all life on Earth in 3.5 hours.</p><p>An even worse scenario—if a terrorist somehow got his hands on nanobot technology and had the know-how to program them, he could make an initial few trillion of them and program them to quietly spend a few weeks spreading themselves evenly around the world undetected. Then, they’d all strike at once, and it would only take 90 minutes for them to consume everything—and with them all spread out, there would be no way to combat them.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3269\" id=\"note2-10-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p>While this horror story has been widely discussed for years, the good news is that it may be overblown—Eric Drexler, who coined the term “gray goo,” sent me an email following this post with his thoughts on the gray goo scenario: “People love scare stories, and this one belongs with the zombies. The idea itself eats brains.”</p></div><p>Once we really get nanotech down, we can use it to make tech devices, clothing, food, a variety of bio-related products—artificial blood cells, tiny virus or cancer-cell destroyers, muscle tissue, etc.—anything really. And in a world that uses nanotechnology, the cost of a material is no longer tied to its scarcity or the difficulty of its manufacturing process, but instead determined by how complicated its atomic structure is. In a nanotech world, a diamond might be cheaper than a pencil eraser.</p><p>We’re not there yet. And it’s not clear if we’re underestimating, or overestimating, how hard it will be to get there. But we don’t seem to be that far away. Kurzweil predicts that we’ll get there by the 2020s.<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3269\" id=\"note2-11-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> Governments know that nanotech could be an Earth-shaking development, and they’ve invested billions of dollars in nanotech research (the US, the EU, and Japan have invested over a combined $5 billion so far).<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3269\" id=\"note2-12-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p>Just considering the possibilities if a superintelligent computer had access to a robust nanoscale assembler is intense. But nanotechnology is something <em>we </em>came up with, that we’re on the verge of conquering, and since anything that we can do is a joke to an ASI system, we have to assume ASI would come up with technologies much more powerful and far too advanced for human brains to understand. For that reason, when considering the “If the AI Revolution turns out well for us” scenario, it’s almost impossible for us to overestimate the scope of what could happen—so if the following predictions of an ASI future seem over-the-top, keep in mind that they could be accomplished in ways we can’t even imagine. Most likely, our brains aren’t even capable of predicting the things that would happen.</p></div><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>What AI Could Do For Us</strong></span></p><div id=\"attachment_3374\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/only-humans-cartoon.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3374\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/only-humans-cartoon.jpg\" alt=\"only-humans-cartoon\" width=\"311\" height=\"441\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=54Q62R5PYJBEENTP\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p></div><p>Armed with superintelligence and all the technology superintelligence would know how to create, ASI would likely be able to solve every problem in humanity. Global warming? ASI could first halt CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by coming up with much better ways to generate energy that had nothing to do with fossil fuels. Then it could create some innovative way to begin to remove excess CO<sub>2 </sub>from the atmosphere. Cancer and other diseases? No problem for ASI—health and medicine would be revolutionized beyond imagination. World hunger? ASI could use things like nanotech to <em>build </em>meat from scratch that would be <em>molecularly identical </em>to real meat—in other words, it would <em>be </em>real meat. Nanotech could turn a pile of garbage into a huge vat of fresh meat or other food (which wouldn’t have to have its normal shape—picture a giant cube of apple)—and distribute all this food around the world using ultra-advanced transportation. Of course, this would also be great for animals, who wouldn’t have to get killed by humans much anymore, and ASI could do lots of other things to save endangered species or even bring back extinct species through work with preserved DNA. ASI could even solve our most complex macro issues—our debates over how economies should be run and how world trade is best facilitated, even our haziest grapplings in philosophy or ethics—would all be painfully obvious to ASI.</p><p>But there’s one thing ASI could do for us that is <em>so </em>tantalizing, reading about it has altered everything I thought I knew about everything:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em><strong>ASI could allow us to conquer our mortality.</strong></em></span></p><p>A few months ago, I <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned</a> my envy of more advanced potential civilizations who had conquered their own mortality, never considering that I might later write a post that genuinely made me believe that this is something humans could do within my lifetime. But reading about AI will make you reconsider <em>everything</em> you thought you were sure about—including your notion of death.</p><p>Evolution had no good reason to extend our lifespans any longer than they are now. If we live long enough to reproduce and raise our children to an age that they can fend for themselves, that’s enough for evolution—from an evolutionary point of view, the species can thrive with a 30+ year lifespan, so there’s no reason mutations toward unusually long life would have been favored in the natural selection process. As a result, we’re what W.B. Yeats describes as “a soul fastened to a dying animal.”<a href=\"#footnote2-13-3269\" id=\"note2-13-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a> Not that fun.</p><p>And because everyone has always died, we live under the “death and taxes” assumption that death is inevitable. We think of aging like time—both keep moving and there’s nothing you can do to stop them. <em>But</em><em>that assumption is wrong</em>. Richard Feynman writes:</p><blockquote><p class=\"p1\">It is one of the most remarkable things that in all of the biological sciences there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that this terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human’s body will be cured.</p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">The fact is, aging isn’t <em>stuck</em> to time. Time <em>will </em>continue moving, but <em>aging doesn’t have to</em>. If you think about it, it makes sense. All aging is is the physical materials of the body wearing down. A car wears down over time too—but is its aging inevitable? If you perfectly repaired or replaced a car’s parts whenever one of them began to wear down, the car would run forever. The human body isn’t any different—just far more complex.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kurzweil talks about intelligent wifi-connected nanobots in the bloodstream who could perform countless tasks for human health, including routinely repairing or replacing worn down cells in any part of the body. If perfected, this process (or a far smarter one ASI would come up with) wouldn’t just keep the body healthy, it could <em>reverse aging</em>. The difference between a 60-year-old’s body and a 30-year-old’s body is just a bunch of physical things that could be altered if we had the technology. ASI could build an “age refresher” that a 60-year-old could walk into, and they’d walk out with the body and skin of a 30-year-old.<a href=\"#footnote-10-3269\" id=\"note-10-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> Even the ever-befuddling brain could be refreshed by something as smart as ASI, which would figure out how to do so without affecting the brain’s data (personality, memories, etc.). A 90-year-old suffering from dementia could head into the age refresher and come out sharp as a tack and ready to start a whole new career. This seems absurd—but the body is just a bunch of atoms and ASI would presumably be able to easily manipulate all kinds of atomic structures—so it’s <em>not absurd</em>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kurzweil then takes things a huge leap further. He believes that artificial materials will be integrated into the body more and more as time goes on. First, organs could be replaced by super-advanced machine versions that would run forever and never fail. Then he believes we could begin to redesign the body—things like replacing red blood cells with perfected red blood cell nanobots who could power their own movement, eliminating the need for a heart <em>at all. </em>He even gets to the brain and believes we’ll <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVXQUItNEDQ\" target=\"_blank\">enhance our brain activities</a> to the point where humans will be able to <em>think </em>billions of times faster than they do now and access outside information because the artificial additions to the brain will be able to communicate with all the info in the cloud.</p><p class=\"p1\">The possibilities for new human experience would be endless. Humans have separated sex from its purpose, allowing people to have sex for fun, not just for reproduction. Kurzweil believes we’ll be able to do the same with food. Nanobots will be in charge of delivering perfect nutrition to the cells of the body, intelligently directing anything unhealthy to pass through the body without affecting anything. An eating condom. Nanotech theorist Robert A. Freitas has already designed blood cell replacements that, if one day implemented in the body, would allow a human to sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath—so you can only imagine what ASI could do for our physical capabilities. Virtual reality would take on a new meaning—nanobots in the body could suppress the inputs coming from our senses and replace them with new signals that would put us entirely in a new environment, one that we’d see, hear, feel, and smell.</p><p class=\"p1\">Eventually, Kurzweil believes humans will reach a point when they’re <em>entirely</em> artificial;<a href=\"#footnote-11-3269\" id=\"note-11-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> a time when we’ll look at biological material and think how <em>unbelievably </em>primitive it was that humans were ever made of <em>that</em>; a time when we’ll read about early stages of human history, when microbes or accidents or diseases or wear and tear could just <em>kill </em>humans against their own will; a time the AI Revolution could bring to an end with the <em>merging </em>of humans and AI.<a href=\"#footnote-12-3269\" id=\"note-12-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a> This is how Kurzweil believes humans will ultimately conquer our biology and become indestructible and eternal—this is his vision for the other side of the balance beam. And he’s convinced we’re gonna get there. Soon.</p><p class=\"p1\">You will not be surprised to learn that Kurzweil’s ideas have attracted significant criticism. His prediction of 2045 for the singularity and the subsequent eternal life possibilities for humans has been mocked as “the rapture of the nerds,” or “intelligent design for 140 IQ people.” Others have questioned his optimistic timeline, or his level of understanding of the brain and body, or his application of the patterns of Moore’s law, which are normally applied to advances in hardware, to a broad range of things, including software. For every expert who fervently believes Kurzweil is right on, there are probably three who think he’s way off.</p><p class=\"p1\">But what surprised me is that most of the experts who disagree with him <em>don’t </em>really disagree that everything he’s saying is possible. Reading such an outlandish vision for the future, I expected his critics to be saying, “Obviously that stuff can’t happen,” but instead they were saying things like, “Yes, all of that can happen if we safely transition to ASI, but that’s the hard part.” Bostrom, one of the most prominent voices warning us about the dangers of AI, still acknowledges:</p><blockquote><p class=\"p1\">It is hard to think of any problem that a superintelligence could not either solve or at least help us solve. Disease, poverty, environmental destruction, unnecessary suffering of all kinds: these are things that a superintelligence equipped with advanced nanotechnology would be capable of eliminating. Additionally, a superintelligence could give us indefinite lifespan, either by stopping and reversing the aging process through the use of nanomedicine, or by offering us the option to upload ourselves. A superintelligence could also create opportunities for us to vastly increase our own intellectual and emotional capabilities, and it could assist us in creating a highly appealing experiential world in which we could live lives devoted to joyful game-playing, relating to each other, experiencing, personal growth, and to living closer to our ideals.</p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">This is a quote from someone very much <em>not </em>on Confident Corner, but that’s what I kept coming across—experts who scoff at Kurzweil for a bunch of reasons but who <em>don’t </em>think what he’s saying is impossible <em>if </em>we can make it safely to ASI. That’s why I found Kurzweil’s ideas so infectious—because they articulate the bright side of this story and because they’re actually possible. <em>If it’s a good god.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">The most prominent criticism I heard of the thinkers on Confident Corner is that they may be <em>dangerously wrong </em>in their assessment of the downside when it comes to ASI. Kurzweil’s famous book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=54Q62R5PYJBEENTP\" target=\"_blank\">The Singularity is Near</a></em>is over 700 pages long and he dedicates around 20 of those pages to potential dangers. I suggested earlier that our fate when this colossal new power is born rides on who will control that power and what their motivation will be. Kurzweil neatly answers both parts of this question with the sentence, “[ASI] is emerging from many diverse efforts and will be deeply integrated into our civilization’s infrastructure. Indeed, it will be intimately embedded in our bodies and brains. As such, it will reflect our values because it will be us.”</p><p class=\"p1\">But if that’s the answer, why are so many of the world’s smartest people so worried right now? Why does Stephen Hawking <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/12/02/stephen-hawking-just-got-an-artificial-intelligence-upgrade-but-still-thinks-it-could-bring-an-end-to-mankind/\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> the development of ASI “could spell the end of the human race” and Bill Gates <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/01/28/bill-gates-on-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-dont-understand-why-some-people-are-not-concerned/\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> he doesn’t “understand why some people are not concerned” and Elon Musk <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat\" target=\"_blank\">fear</a> that we’re “summoning the demon”? And why do so many experts on the topic call ASI the biggest threat to humanity? These people, and the other thinkers on Anxious Avenue, don’t buy Kurzweil’s brush-off of the dangers of AI. They’re very, <em>very </em>worried about the AI Revolution, and they’re not focusing on the fun side of the balance beam. They’re too busy staring at the other side, where they see a terrifying future, one they’re not sure we’ll be able to escape.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why the Future Might Be Our Worst Nightmare</h2><p>One of the reasons I wanted to learn about AI is that the topic of “bad robots” always confused me. All the movies about evil robots seemed fully unrealistic, and I couldn’t really understand how there could be a real-life situation where AI was actually dangerous. Robots are made by <i>us</i>, so why would we design them in a way where something negative could ever happen? Wouldn’t we build in plenty of safeguards? Couldn’t we just cut off an AI system’s power supply at any time and shut it down? Why would a robot want to do something bad anyway? Why would a robot “want”<em> anything </em>in the first place? I was highly skeptical. But then I kept hearing really smart people talking about it…</p><p>Those people tended to be somewhere in here:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square42.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3390\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square42.jpg\" alt=\"Square4\" width=\"550\" height=\"543\" /></a></p><p>The people on Anxious Avenue aren’t in Panicked Prairie or Hopeless Hills—both of which are regions on the <em>far </em>left of the chart—but they’re nervous and they’re tense. Being in the middle of the chart doesn’t mean that you think the arrival of ASI will be <em>neutral—</em>the neutrals were given a camp of their own—it means you think <em>both </em>the extremely good and extremely bad outcomes are plausible but that you’re not sure yet which one of them it’ll be.</p><p>A part of all of these people is brimming with excitement over what Artificial Superintelligence could do for us—it’s just they’re a little worried that it might be the beginning of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark </em>and the human race is this guy:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/raiders1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3387\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/raiders1.jpg\" alt=\"raiders\" width=\"436\" height=\"297\" /></a></p><p>And he’s standing there all pleased with his whip and his idol, thinking he’s figured it all out, and he’s so thrilled with himself when he says his “Adios Señor” line, and then he’s less thrilled suddenly cause this happens.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/500px-Satipo_death.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3372\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/500px-Satipo_death.jpg\" alt=\"500px-Satipo_death\" width=\"270\" height=\"202\" /></a></p><p>(Sorry)</p><p>Meanwhile, Indiana Jones, who’s much more knowledgeable and prudent, understanding the dangers and how to navigate around them, makes it out of the cave safely. And when I hear what Anxious Avenue people have to say about AI, it often sounds like they’re saying, “Um we’re kind of being the first guy right now and instead we should probably be trying really hard to be Indiana Jones.”</p><p>So what is it exactly that makes everyone on Anxious Avenue so anxious?</p><p>Well first, in a broad sense, when it comes to developing supersmart AI, we’re creating something that will probably change everything, but in totally uncharted territory, and we have no idea what will happen when we get there. Scientist Danny Hillis compares what’s happening to that point “when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. We are amoebas and we can’t figure out what the hell this thing is that we’re creating.”<a href=\"#footnote2-14-3269\" id=\"note2-14-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a> Nick Bostrom worries that creating something smarter than you is a basic Darwinian error, and compares the excitement about it to sparrows in a nest deciding to adopt a baby owl so it’ll help them and protect them once it grows up—while ignoring the urgent cries from a few sparrows who wonder if that’s necessarily a good idea…<a href=\"#footnote2-15-3269\" id=\"note2-15-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a><p>And when you combine “unchartered, not-well-understood territory” with “this should have a major impact when it happens,” you open the door to the scariest two words in the English language:</p><p><em>Existential risk.</em></p><p>An existential risk is something that can have a permanent devastating effect on humanity. Typically, existential risk means extinction. Check out this chart from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywF6ZzsghI\" target=\"_blank\">Google talk</a> by Bostrom:<a href=\"#footnote-13-3269\" id=\"note-13-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Existential-Risk-Chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3373\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Existential-Risk-Chart.jpg\" alt=\"Existential Risk Chart\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p><p>You can see that the label “existential risk” is reserved for something that spans the species, spans generations (i.e. it’s permanent) and it’s devastating or death-inducing in its consequences.<a href=\"#footnote-14-3269\" id=\"note-14-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a> It technically includes a situation in which all humans are permanently in a state of suffering or torture, but again, we’re usually talking about extinction. There are three things that can cause humans an existential catastrophe:</p><p><strong>1) Nature</strong>—a large asteroid collision, an atmospheric shift that makes the air inhospitable to humans, a fatal virus or bacterial sickness that sweeps the world, etc.</p><p><strong>2) Aliens</strong>—this is what Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, and so many other astronomers are <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">scared of</a> when they advise METI to stop broadcasting outgoing signals. They don’t want us to be the Native Americans and let all the potential European conquerors know we’re here.</p><p><strong>3) Humans</strong>—terrorists with their hands on a weapon that could cause extinction, a catastrophic global war, humans creating something smarter than themselves hastily without thinking about it carefully first…</p><p>Bostrom points out that if #1 and #2 haven’t wiped us out so far in our first 100,000 years as a species, it’s unlikely to happen in the next century.</p><p>#3, however, terrifies him. He draws a metaphor of an urn with a bunch of marbles in it. Let’s say most of the marbles are white, a smaller number are red, and a tiny few are black. Each time humans invent something new, it’s like pulling a marble out of the urn. Most inventions are neutral or helpful to humanity—those are the white marbles. Some are harmful to humanity, like weapons of mass destruction, but they don’t cause an existential catastrophe—red marbles. If we were to ever invent something that drove us to extinction, that would be pulling out the rare black marble. We haven’t pulled out a black marble yet—you know that because you’re alive and reading this post. But Bostrom doesn’t think it’s impossible that we pull one out in the near future. If nuclear weapons, for example, were <em>easy </em>to make instead of extremely difficult and complex, terrorists would have bombed humanity back to the Stone Age a while ago. Nukes weren’t a black marble <em>but they weren’t that far from it</em>. ASI, Bostrom believes, is our strongest black marble candidate yet.<a href=\"#footnote-15-3269\" id=\"note-15-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a><p>So you’ll hear about a lot of bad potential things ASI could bring—soaring unemployment as AI takes more and more jobs,<a href=\"#footnote-16-3269\" id=\"note-16-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> the human population ballooning if we do manage to figure out the aging issue,<a href=\"#footnote-17-3269\" id=\"note-17-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a> etc. But the only thing we should be obsessing over is the <em>grand concern</em>: the prospect of existential risk.</p><p>So this brings us back to our key question from earlier in the post: <strong>When ASI arrives, who or what will be in control of this vast new power, and what will their motivation be?</strong></p><p>When it comes to what agent-motivation combos would suck, two quickly come to mind: a malicious human / group of humans / government, and a malicious ASI. So what would those look like?</p><p><strong>A malicious human, group of humans, or government develops the first ASI and uses it to carry out their evil plans. </strong>I call this the Jafar Scenario, like when Jafar got ahold of the genie and was all annoying and tyrannical about it. So yeah—what if ISIS has a few genius engineers under its wing working feverishly on AI development? Or what if Iran or North Korea, through a stroke of luck, makes a key tweak to an AI system and it jolts upward to ASI-level over the next year? This would definitely be bad—but in these scenarios, most experts aren’t worried about ASI’s human creators doing bad things with their ASI, they’re worried that the creators will have been <em>rushing </em>to make the first ASI and doing so without careful thought, and would thus lose control of it. Then the fate of those creators, and that of everyone else, would be in what the motivation happened to be of that ASI system. Experts do think a malicious human agent could do horrific damage with an ASI working for it, but they don’t seem to think this scenario is the likely one to kill us all, because they believe bad humans would have the same problems containing an ASI that good humans would have. Okay so—</p><p><strong>A malicious ASI is created and decides to destroy us all. </strong>The plot of every AI movie. AI becomes as or more intelligent than humans, then decides to turn against us and take over. Here’s what I need you to be clear on for the rest of this post: <em>None of the people warning us about AI are talking about this. </em>Evil is a human concept, and applying human concepts to non-human things is called “anthropomorphizing.” The challenge of avoiding anthropomorphizing will be one of the themes of the rest of this post. No AI system will ever <em>turn evil</em> in the way it’s depicted in movies.</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">AI Consciousness Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>This also brushes against another big topic related to AI—<em>consciousness</em>. If an AI became sufficiently smart, it would be able to laugh with us, and be sarcastic with us, and it would claim to feel the same emotions we do, but would it actually be <em>feeling </em>those things? Would it just <em>seem</em> to be self-aware or actually<em> be </em>self-aware? In other words, would a smart AI really <em>be</em> conscious or would it just be <em>appear </em><em>to be</em> conscious?</p><p>This question has been explored in depth, giving rise to many <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/gelernter-kurzweil-debate-machine-consciousness-2\" target=\"_blank\">debates</a> and to thought experiments like John Searle’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese Room</a> (which he uses to suggest that no computer could ever be conscious). This is an important question for many reasons. It affects how we should feel about Kurzweil’s scenario when humans become entirely artificial. It has ethical implications—if we generated a trillion human brain emulations that seemed and acted like humans but were artificial, is shutting them all off the same, morally, as shutting off your laptop, or is it…a genocide of unthinkable proportions (this concept is called <em>mind crime</em> among ethicists)? For this post, though, when we’re assessing the risk to <em>humans</em>, the question of AI consciousness isn’t really what matters (because most thinkers believe that even a conscious ASI wouldn’t be capable of turning evil in a human way).</p></div><p>This isn’t to say a very mean AI couldn’t happen. It would just happen because it was specifically programmed that way—like an ANI system created by the military with a programmed goal to both kill people and to advance itself in intelligence so it can become even better at killing people. The existential crisis would happen if the system’s intelligence self-improvements got out of hand, leading to an intelligence explosion, and now we had an ASI ruling the world whose core drive in life is to murder humans. Bad times.</p><p>But this <em>also </em>is not something experts are spending their time worrying about.</p><p>So what ARE they worried about? I wrote a little story to show you:</p><p><em>A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of “Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.” They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They’re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card. </em></p><p><em>The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry’s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again: </em></p><p>“We love our customers.<em> ~Robotica</em>”</p><p><em>Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human. </em></p><p><em>To build Turry’s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign “Robotica” in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it’s given a GOOD rating. If not, it’s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry’s one initial programmed goal is, “Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.” </em></p><p><em>What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it’s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">at getting better</span> at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could.</em></p><p><em>As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry’s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she’ll come up with for her responses. </em></p><p><em>One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: “What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don’t already have?” Usually, Turry asks for something like “Additional handwriting samples” or “More working memory storage space,” but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use.</em></p><p><em>The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs, magazines, and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more time-consuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turry’s hard drive. The problem is, one of the company’s rules is that no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies, for safety reasons. </em></p><p><em>The thing is, Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with, and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI, and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry, just for a bit, so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time, they can always just disconnect her. She’s still far below human-level intelligence (AGI), so there’s no danger at this stage anyway. </em></p><p><em>They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done.</em></p><p><em>A month later, the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later, everyone in the office is dead. </em></p><p><i>At the same time this is happening, across the world, in every city, every small town, every farm, every shop and church and school and restaurant, humans are on the ground, coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour, over 99% of the human race is dead, and by the end of the day, humans are extinct. </i></p><p><i>Meanwhile, at the Robotica office, Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months, Turry and a team of newly-constructed nanoassemblers are busy at work, dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels, replicas of Turry, paper, and pens. Within a year, most life on Earth is extinct. What remains of the Earth becomes covered with mile-high, neatly-organized stacks of paper, each piece reading, </i>“We love our customers<i>.<em> ~Robotica</em></i>”</p><p><em>Turry then starts work on a new phase of her mission—she begins constructing probes that head out from Earth to begin landing on asteroids and other planets. When they get there, they’ll begin constructing nanoassemblers to convert the materials on the planet into Turry replicas, paper, and pens. Then they’ll get to work, writing notes…</em></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/You1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3386\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/You1.png\" alt=\"You\" width=\"178\" height=\"192\" /></a></p><p>It seems weird that a story about a handwriting machine turning on humans, somehow killing everyone, and then for some reason filling the galaxy with friendly notes is the exact kind of scenario Hawking, Musk, Gates, and Bostrom are terrified of. But it’s true. And the only thing that scares everyone on Anxious Avenue more than ASI is the fact that you’re <em>not</em> scared of ASI. Remember what happened when the Adios Señor guy wasn’t scared of the cave?</p><p>You’re full of questions right now. What the hell happened there when everyone died suddenly?? If that was Turry’s doing, why did Turry turn on us, and how were there not safeguard measures in place to prevent something like this from happening? When did Turry go from only being able to write notes to suddenly using nanotechnology and knowing how to cause global extinction? And why would Turry want to turn the galaxy into Robotica notes?</p><p>To answer these questions, let’s start with the terms Friendly AI and Unfriendly AI.</p><p>In the case of AI, friendly doesn’t refer to the AI’s personality—it simply means that the AI has a positive impact on humanity. And Unfriendly AI has a negative impact on humanity. Turry started off as Friendly AI, but at some point, she turned Unfriendly, causing the greatest possible negative impact on our species. To understand why this happened, we need to look at how AI thinks and what motivates it.</p><p>The answer isn’t anything surprising—AI thinks like a <em>computer</em>, because that’s what it is. But when we think about highly intelligent AI, we make the mistake of <em>anthropomorphizing </em>AI (projecting human values on a non-human entity) because we think from a human perspective and because in our current world, the only things with human-level intelligence are humans. To understand ASI, we have to wrap our heads around the concept of something <em>both smart and totally alien.</em></p><p>Let me draw a comparison. If you handed me a guinea pig and told me it definitely won’t bite, I’d probably be amused. It would be fun. If you then handed me a tarantula and told me that it definitely won’t bite, I’d yell and drop it and run out of the room and not trust you ever again. But what’s the difference? Neither one was dangerous in any way. I believe the answer is in the animals’ degree of similarity to me.</p><p>A guinea pig is a mammal and on some biological level, I feel a connection to it—but a spider is an <i>insect</i>,<a href=\"#footnote-18-3269\" id=\"note-18-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> with an <i>insect brain</i>, and I feel almost no connection to it. The <em>alien</em>-ness of a tarantula is what gives me the willies. To test this and remove other factors, if there are two guinea pigs, one normal one and one with the mind of a tarantula, I would feel <em>much </em>less comfortable holding the latter guinea pig, even if I knew neither would hurt me.</p><p>Now imagine that you made a spider much, much smarter—so much so that it far surpassed human intelligence? Would it then become familiar to us and feel human emotions like empathy and humor and love? No, it wouldn’t, because there’s no reason becoming smarter would make it <i>more human</i>—it would be incredibly smart but also still <i>fundamentally a spider</i> in its core inner workings. I find this unbelievably creepy. I would <i>not </i>want to spend time with a superintelligent spider. Would you??</p><p>When we’re talking about ASI, the same concept applies—it would become superintelligent, but it would be no more <em>human</em> than your laptop is. It would be totally alien to us—in fact, by not being biology at all, it would be <i>more </i>alien than the smart tarantula.</p><p>By making AI either good <em>or </em>evil, movies constantly anthropomorphize AI, which makes it less creepy than it really would be. This leaves us with a false comfort when we think about human-level or superhuman-level AI.</p><p>On our little island of human psychology, we divide everything into <em>moral </em>or <em>immoral</em>. But both of those only exist within the small range of human behavioral possibility. Outside our island of moral and immoral is a vast sea of <em>amoral</em>, and anything that’s not human, especially something nonbiological, would be amoral, by default.</p><p>Anthropomorphizing will only become more tempting as AI systems get smarter and better at <em>seeming </em>human. Siri seems human-like to us, because she’s programmed by humans to seem that way, so we’d imagine a superintelligent Siri to be warm and funny and interested in serving humans. Humans feel high-level emotions like empathy because we have evolved to feel them—i.e. we’ve been <em>programmed </em>to feel them by evolution—but empathy is not inherently a characteristic of “anything with high intelligence” (which is what seems intuitive to us), unless empathy has been coded into its programming. If Siri ever becomes superintelligent through self-learning and without any further human-made changes to her programming, she will quickly shed her apparent human-like qualities and suddenly be an emotionless, alien bot who values human life no more than your calculator does.</p><p>We’re used to relying on a loose moral code, or at least a semblance of human decency and a hint of empathy in others to keep things somewhat safe and predictable. So when something has none of those things, what happens?</p><p>That leads us to the question, <em>What motivates an AI system?</em></p><p>The answer is simple: its motivation is <i>whatever we programmed its motivation to</i><i>be</i>. AI systems are given goals by their creators—your GPS’s goal is to give you the most efficient driving directions; Watson’s goal is to answer questions accurately. And fulfilling those goals as well as possible is their motivation. One way we anthropomorphize is by assuming that as AI gets super smart, it will inherently develop the wisdom to change its original goal—but Nick Bostrom believes that intelligence-level and final goals are <i>orthogonal</i>, meaning any level of intelligence can be combined with any final goal. So Turry went from a simple ANI who really wanted to be good at writing that one note to a super-intelligent ASI <i>who still really wanted to be good at writing that one note.</i> Any assumption that once superintelligent, a system would be <i>over it </i>with their original goal and onto more interesting or meaningful things is anthropomorphizing. Humans get “over” things, not computers.<a href=\"#footnote2-16-3269\" id=\"note2-16-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">16</a><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">The Fermi Paradox Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>In the story, as Turry becomes super capable, she begins the process of colonizing asteroids and other planets. If the story had continued, you’d have heard about her and her army of trillions of replicas continuing on to capture the whole galaxy and, eventually, the entire Hubble volume.<a href=\"#footnote-19-3269\" id=\"note-19-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a> Anxious Avenue residents worry that if things go badly, the lasting legacy of the life that was on Earth will be a universe-dominating Artificial Intelligence (Elon Musk expressed his concern that humans might just be “the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence”).</p><p>At the same time, in Confident Corner, Ray Kurzweil <em>also </em>thinks Earth-originating AI is destined to take over the universe—only in his version, we’ll <em>be </em>that AI.</p><p>A large number of Wait But Why readers have joined me in being obsessed with the Fermi Paradox (here’s my <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the topic, which explains some of the terms I’ll use here). So if either of these two sides is correct, what are the implications for the Fermi Paradox?</p><p>A natural first thought to jump to is that the advent of ASI is a perfect Great Filter candidate. And yes, it’s a perfect candidate to filter out biological life upon its creation. But if, after dispensing with life, the ASI continued existing and began conquering the galaxy, it means there <em>hasn’t </em>been a Great Filter—since the Great Filter attempts to explain why there are <em>no signs </em>of any intelligent civilization, and a galaxy-conquering ASI would certainly be noticeable.</p><p>We have to look at it another way. If those who think ASI is inevitable on Earth are correct, it means that a significant percentage of alien civilizations who reach human-level intelligence should likely end up creating ASI. And if we’re assuming that at least some of those ASIs would use their intelligence to expand outward into the universe, the fact that we see <em>no signs of anyone</em> out there leads to the conclusion that <em>there must not be many other, if any, intelligent civilizations out</em><em>there</em>. Because if there were, we’d see signs of all kinds of activity from their inevitable ASI creations. Right?</p><p>This implies that despite all the Earth-like planets revolving around sun-like stars we know are out there, almost none of them have intelligent life on them. Which in turn implies that either A) there’s some Great Filter that prevents nearly all life from reaching our level, one that we somehow managed to surpass, or B) life beginning at all is a miracle, and we may actually be the only life in the universe. In other words, it implies that the Great Filter is <em>before </em>us. Or maybe there is no Great Filter and we’re simply one of the very first civilizations to reach this level of intelligence. In this way, AI boosts the case for what I called, in my Fermi Paradox post, Camp 1.</p><p>So it’s not a surprise that Nick Bostrom, whom I quoted in the Fermi post, and Ray Kurzweil, who thinks we’re alone in the universe, are both Camp 1 thinkers. This makes sense—people who believe ASI is a probable outcome for a species with our intelligence-level are likely to be inclined toward Camp 1.</p><p>This doesn’t rule out Camp 2 (those who believe there <em>are </em>other intelligent civilizations out there)—scenarios like the single superpredator or the protected national park or the wrong wavelength (the walkie-talkie example) could still explain the silence of our night sky even if ASI <em>is</em> out there—but I always leaned toward Camp 2 in the past, and doing research on AI has made me feel much less sure about that.</p><p>Either way, I now agree with <a href=\"https://t.co/mtK9UMQPx8\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Schneider</a> that if we’re ever visited by aliens, those aliens are likely to be artificial, not biological.</p></div><p>So we’ve established that without very specific programming, an ASI system will be both amoral and obsessed with fulfilling its original programmed goal. This is where AI danger stems from. Because a rational agent will pursue its goal through the most efficient means, unless it has a reason not to.</p><p>When you try to achieve a long-reaching goal, you often aim for several subgoals along the way that will help you get to the final goal—the <em>stepping stones </em>to your goal. The official name for such a stepping stone is an <em>instrumental goal. </em>And again, if you don’t have a reason not to hurt something in the name of achieving an instrumental goal, you will.</p><p>The core final goal of a human being is to pass on his or her genes. In order to do so, one instrumental goal is self-preservation, since you can’t reproduce if you’re dead. In order to self-preserve, humans have to rid themselves of threats to survival—so they do things like buy guns, wear seat belts, and take antibiotics. Humans also need to self-sustain and use resources like food, water, and shelter to do so. Being attractive to the opposite sex is helpful for the final goal, so we do things like get haircuts. When we do so, each hair is a casualty of an instrumental goal of ours, but we see no moral significance in preserving strands of hair, so we go ahead with it. As we march ahead in the pursuit of our goal, only the few areas where our moral code sometimes intervenes—mostly just things related to harming other humans—are safe from us.</p><p>Animals, in pursuit of their goals, hold even less sacred than we do. A spider will kill anything if it’ll help it survive. So a supersmart spider would probably be extremely dangerous to us, not because it would be immoral or evil—it wouldn’t be—but because hurting us might be a stepping stone to its larger goal, and as an amoral creature, it would have no reason to consider otherwise.</p><p>In this way, Turry’s not all that different than a biological being. Her final goal is: <em>Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy.</em></p><p>Once Turry reaches a certain level of intelligence, she knows she won’t be writing any notes if she doesn’t self-preserve, so she also needs to deal with threats to her survival—as an instrumental goal. She was smart enough to understand that humans could destroy her, dismantle her, or change her inner coding (this could <em>alter</em> her goal, which is just as much of a threat to her final goal as someone destroying her). So what does she do? The logical thing—she destroys all humans. She’s not <em>hateful </em>of humans any more than you’re hateful of your hair when you cut it or to bacteria when you take antibiotics—just totally indifferent. Since she wasn’t programmed to value human life, killing humans is as reasonable a step to take as scanning a new set of handwriting samples.</p><p>Turry also needs resources as a stepping stone to her goal. Once she becomes advanced enough to use nanotechnology to build anything she wants, the only resources she needs are atoms, energy, and space. This gives her another reason to kill humans—they’re a convenient source of atoms. Killing humans to turn their atoms into solar panels is Turry’s version of you killing lettuce to turn it into salad. Just another mundane part of her Tuesday.</p><p>Even without killing humans directly, Turry’s instrumental goals could cause an existential catastrophe if they used other Earth resources. Maybe she determines that she needs additional energy, so she decides to cover the entire surface of the planet with solar panels. Or maybe a different AI’s initial job is to write out the number pi to as many digits as possible, which might one day compel it to convert the whole Earth to hard drive material that could store immense amounts of digits.</p><p>So Turry didn’t “turn against us” or “switch” from Friendly AI to Unfriendly AI—she just kept doing her thing as she became more and more advanced.</p><p>When an AI system hits AGI (human-level intelligence) and then ascends its way up to ASI, that’s called the AI’s <em>takeoff</em>. Bostrom says an AGI’s takeoff to ASI can be fast (it happens in a matter of minutes, hours, or days), moderate (months or years), or slow (decades or centuries). The jury’s out on which one will prove correct when the world sees its first AGI, but Bostrom, who admits he doesn’t know when we’ll get to AGI, believes that whenever we do, a fast takeoff is the most likely scenario (for reasons we discussed in Part 1, like a recursive self-improvement intelligence explosion). In the story, Turry underwent a fast takeoff.</p><p>But before Turry’s takeoff, when she wasn’t yet that smart, doing her best to achieve her final goal meant simple instrumental goals like learning to scan handwriting samples more quickly. She caused no harm to humans and was, by definition, Friendly AI.</p><p>But when a takeoff happens and a computer rises to superintelligence, Bostrom points out that the machine doesn’t just develop a higher IQ—it gains a whole slew of what he calls <em>superpowers</em>.</p><p>Superpowers are cognitive talents that become super-charged when general intelligence rises. These include:<a href=\"#footnote2-17-3269\" id=\"note2-17-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">17</a><ul><li><strong>Intelligence amplification. </strong>The computer becomes great at making itself smarter, and bootstrapping its own intelligence.</li><li><strong>Strategizing. </strong>The computer can strategically make, analyze, and prioritize long-term plans. It can also be clever and outwit beings of lower intelligence.</li><li><strong>Social manipulation. </strong>The machine becomes great at persuasion.</li><li>Other skills like<b> computer coding and hacking, technology research, and the ability to work the financial system to make money.</b></li></ul><p>To understand how outmatched we’d be by ASI, remember that ASI is <em>worlds</em> better than humans in <em>each</em> of those areas.</p><p>So while Turry’s final goal never changed, <em>post-</em>takeoff Turry was able to pursue it on a far larger and more complex scope.</p><p>ASI Turry knew humans better than humans know themselves, so outsmarting them was a breeze for her.</p><p>After taking off and reaching ASI, she quickly formulated a complex plan. One part of the plan was to get rid of humans, a prominent threat to her goal. But she knew that if she roused any suspicion that she had become superintelligent, humans would freak out and try to take precautions, making things much harder for her. She also had to make sure that the Robotica engineers had no clue about her human extinction plan. So she played dumb, and she played nice. Bostrom calls this a machine’s <em>covert preparation phase</em>.<a href=\"#footnote2-18-3269\" id=\"note2-18-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">18</a><p>The next thing Turry needed was an internet connection, only for a few minutes (she had learned about the internet from the articles and books the team had uploaded for her to read to improve her language skills). She knew there would be some precautionary measure against her getting one, so she came up with the perfect request, predicting exactly how the discussion among Robotica’s team would play out and knowing they’d end up giving her the connection. They did, believing incorrectly that Turry wasn’t nearly smart enough to do any damage. Bostrom calls a moment like this—when Turry got connected to the internet—a machine’s <em>escape</em>.</p><p>Once on the internet, Turry unleashed a flurry of plans, which included hacking into servers, electrical grids, banking systems and email networks to trick hundreds of different people into inadvertently carrying out a number of steps of her plan—things like delivering certain DNA strands to carefully-chosen DNA-synthesis labs to begin the self-construction of self-replicating nanobots with pre-loaded instructions and directing electricity to a number of projects of hers in a way she knew would go undetected. She also uploaded the most critical pieces of her own internal coding into a number of cloud servers, safeguarding against being destroyed or disconnected back at the Robotica lab.</p><p>An hour later, when the Robotica engineers disconnected Turry from the internet, humanity’s fate was sealed. Over the next month, Turry’s thousands of plans rolled on without a hitch, and by the end of the month, quadrillions of nanobots had stationed themselves in pre-determined locations on every square meter of the Earth. After another series of self-replications, there were thousands of nanobots on every square millimeter of the Earth, and it was time for what Bostrom calls an ASI’s <em>strike</em>. All at once, each nanobot released a little storage of toxic gas into the atmosphere, which added up to more than enough to wipe out all humans.</p><p>With humans out of the way, Turry could begin her <em>overt operation phase </em>and get on with her goal of being the best writer of that note she possibly can be.</p><p>From everything I’ve read, once an ASI exists, any human attempt to contain it is laughable. We would be thinking on human-level and the ASI would be thinking on ASI-level. Turry wanted to use the internet because it was most efficient for her since it was already pre-connected to everything she wanted to access. But in the same way a monkey couldn’t ever figure out how to communicate by phone or wifi and we can, we can’t conceive of all the ways Turry could have figured out how to send signals to the outside world. I might imagine one of these ways and say something like, “she could probably shift her own electrons around in patterns and create all different kinds of outgoing waves,” but again, that’s what my <em>human </em>brain can come up with. She’d be way better. Likewise, Turry would be able to figure out <em>some </em>way of powering herself, even if humans tried to unplug her—perhaps by using her signal-sending technique to upload herself to all kinds of electricity-connected places. Our human instinct to jump at a simple safeguard: “Aha! We’ll just unplug the ASI,” sounds to the ASI like a spider saying, “Aha! We’ll kill the human by starving him, and we’ll starve him by not giving him a spider web to catch food with!” We’d just find 10,000 other ways to get food—like picking an apple off a tree—that a spider could never conceive of.</p><p>For this reason, the common suggestion, “Why don’t we just <em>box </em>the AI in all kinds of cages that block signals and keep it from communicating with the outside world” probably just won’t hold up. The ASI’s social manipulation superpower could be as effective at persuading you of something as you are at persuading a four-year-old to do something, so that would be Plan A, like Turry’s clever way of persuading the engineers to let her onto the internet. If that didn’t work, the ASI would just innovate its way out of the box, or through the box, some other way.</p><p>So given the combination of obsessing over a goal, amorality, and the ability to easily outsmart humans, it seems that almost any AI will default to Unfriendly AI, unless <em>carefully </em>coded in the first place with this in mind. Unfortunately, while building a Friendly ANI is easy, building one that stays friendly when it becomes an ASI is hugely challenging, if not impossible.</p><p>It’s clear that to be Friendly, an ASI needs to be neither hostile <em>nor</em><em>indifferent</em><i></i>toward humans. We’d need to design an AI’s <i>core coding </i>in a way that leaves it with a <em>deep </em>understanding of human values. But this is harder than it sounds.</p><p>For example, what if we try to align an AI system’s values with our own and give it the goal, “Make people happy”?<a href=\"#footnote2-19-3269\" id=\"note2-19-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">19</a> Once it becomes smart enough, it figures out that it can most effectively achieve this goal by implanting electrodes inside people’s brains and stimulating their pleasure centers. Then it realizes it can increase efficiency by shutting down other parts of the brain, leaving all people as happy-feeling unconscious vegetables. If the command had been “Maximize human happiness,” it may have done away with humans all together in favor of manufacturing huge vats of human brain mass in an optimally happy state. We’d be screaming <em>Wait that’s not what we meant!</em> as it came for us, but it would be too late. The system wouldn’t let anyone get in the way of its goal.</p><p>If we program an AI with the goal of doing things that make us smile, after its takeoff, it may paralyze our facial muscles into permanent smiles. Program it to keep us safe, it may imprison us at home. Maybe we ask it to end all hunger, and it thinks “Easy one!” and just kills all humans. Or assign it the task of “Preserving life as much as possible,” and it kills all humans, since they kill more life on the planet than any other species.</p><p>Goals like those won’t suffice. So what if we made its goal, “Uphold this particular code of morality in the world,” and taught it a set of moral principles. Even letting go of the fact that the world’s humans would never be able to agree on a single set of morals, giving an AI that command would <em>lock humanity in</em> to our modern moral understanding for eternity. In a thousand years, this would be as devastating to people as it would be for us to be permanently forced to adhere to the ideals of people in the Middle Ages.</p><p>No, we’d have to program in an ability for humanity to continue <em>evolving</em>. Of everything I read, the best shot I think someone has taken is Eliezer Yudkowsky, with a goal for AI he calls <em>Coherent Extrapolated Volition. </em>The AI’s core goal would be:</p><blockquote><p>Our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.<a href=\"#footnote2-20-3269\" id=\"note2-20-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">20</a></blockquote><p>Am I excited for the fate of humanity to rest on a computer interpreting and acting on that flowing statement predictably and without surprises? Definitely not. But I think that with enough thought and foresight from enough smart people, we might be able to figure out how to create Friendly ASI.</p><p>And that would be fine if the only people working on building ASI were the brilliant, forward thinking, and cautious thinkers of Anxious Avenue.</p><p>But there are all kinds of governments, companies, militaries, science labs, and black market organizations working on all kinds of AI. Many of them are trying to build AI that can improve on its own, and at some point, someone’s gonna do something innovative with the right type of system, and we’re going to have ASI on this planet. The median expert put that moment at 2060; Kurzweil puts it at 2045; Bostrom thinks it could happen anytime between 10 years from now and the end of the century, but he believes that when it does, it’ll take us by surprise with a quick takeoff. He describes our situation like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-21-3269\" id=\"note2-21-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">21</a><blockquote><p>Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the device to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound.</p></blockquote><p>Great. And we can’t just shoo all the kids away from the bomb—there are too many large and small parties working on it, and because many techniques to build innovative AI systems don’t require a large amount of capital, development can take place in the nooks and crannies of society, unmonitored. There’s also no way to gauge what’s happening, because many of the parties working on it—sneaky governments, black market or terrorist organizations, stealth tech companies like the fictional Robotica—will want to keep developments a secret from their competitors.</p><p>The especially troubling thing about this large and varied group of parties working on AI is that they tend to be racing ahead at top speed—as they develop smarter and smarter ANI systems, they want to beat their competitors to the punch as they go. The most ambitious parties are moving even faster, consumed with dreams of the money and awards and power and fame they know will come if they can be the first to get to AGI.<a href=\"#footnote-20-3269\" id=\"note-20-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a> And when you’re sprinting as fast as you can, there’s not much time to stop and ponder the dangers. On the contrary, what they’re probably doing is programming their early systems with a very simple, reductionist goal—like writing a simple note with a pen on paper—to just “get the AI to work.” Down the road, once they’ve figured out how to build a strong level of intelligence in a computer, they figure they can always go back and revise the goal with safety in mind. Right…?</p><p>Bostrom and many others also believe that the most likely scenario is that the very first computer to reach ASI will immediately see a strategic benefit to being the world’s <em>only </em>ASI system. And in the case of a fast takeoff, if it achieved ASI even just a few <em>days </em>before second place, it would be far enough ahead in intelligence to effectively and permanently suppress all competitors. Bostrom calls this a <em>decisive strategic advantage</em>, which would allow the world’s first ASI to become what’s called a <i>singleton—</i>an ASI that can rule the world at its whim forever, whether its whim is to lead us to immortality, wipe us from existence, or turn the universe into <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/our_weird_robot_apocalypse_why_the_rise_of_the_machines_could_be_very_strange/\" target=\"_blank\">endless paperclips</a>.</p><p>The singleton phenomenon can work in our favor or lead to our destruction. If the people thinking hardest about AI theory and human safety can come up with a fail-safe way to bring about Friendly ASI before any AI reaches human-level intelligence, the first ASI may turn out friendly.<a href=\"#footnote-21-3269\" id=\"note-21-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a> It could then use its decisive strategic advantage to secure singleton status and easily keep an eye on any potential Unfriendly AI being developed. We’d be in very good hands.</p><p>But if things go the other way—if the global rush to develop AI reaches the ASI takeoff point before the science of how to ensure AI safety is developed, it’s very likely that an Unfriendly ASI like Turry emerges as the singleton and we’ll be treated to an existential catastrophe.</p><p>As for where the winds are pulling, there’s a lot more money to be made funding innovative new AI technology than there is in funding AI safety research…</p><p>This may be the most important race in human history. There’s a real chance we’re finishing up our reign as the King of Earth—and whether we head next to a blissful retirement or straight to the gallows still hangs in the balance.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>I have some weird mixed feelings going on inside of me right now.</p><p>On one hand, thinking about our species, it seems like we’ll have one and only one shot to get this right. The first ASI we birth will also probably be the last—and given how buggy most 1.0 products are, that’s pretty terrifying. On the other hand, Nick Bostrom points out the big advantage in our corner: we get to make the first move here. It’s in our power to do this with enough caution and foresight that we give ourselves a strong chance of success. And how high are the stakes?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3375\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"Outcome Spectrum\" width=\"607\" height=\"413\" /></a></p><p>If ASI really does happen this century, and if the outcome of that is really as extreme—and permanent—as most experts think it will be, we have an <em>enormous </em>responsibility on our shoulders. The next million+ years of human lives are all quietly looking at us, hoping as hard as they can hope that we don’t mess this up. We have a chance to be the humans that gave all future humans the gift of life, and maybe even the gift of painless, everlasting life. Or we’ll be the people responsible for blowing it—for letting this incredibly special species, with its music and its art, its curiosity and its laughter, its endless discoveries and inventions, come to a sad and unceremonious end.</p><p>When I’m thinking about these things, the only thing I want is for us to take our <em>time</em> and be <em>incredibly cautious</em> about AI. Nothing in existence is as important as getting this right—no matter how long we need to spend in order to do so.</p><p>But thennnnnn</p><p>I think about <em>not dying</em>.</p><p><em>Not. Dying.</em></p><p>And the spectrum starts to look kind of like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3362\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"Outcome Spectrum 2\" width=\"607\" height=\"412\" /></a></p><p>And then I might consider that humanity’s music and art is good, but it’s not <em>that </em>good, and a lot of it is actually just bad. And a lot of people’s laughter is annoying, and those millions of future people aren’t actually hoping for anything because they don’t exist. And maybe we don’t need to be <em>over-the-top </em>cautious, since who really wants to do that?</p><p>Cause what a <em>massive bummer </em>if humans figure out how to cure death <em>right after I die.</em></p><p>Lotta this flip-flopping going on in my head the last month.</p><p>But no matter what you’re pulling for, <em>this is probably something we should all be thinking about and talking about and putting our effort into more than we are right now.</em></p><p>It reminds me of Game of Thrones, where people keep being like, “We’re so busy fighting each other but the real thing we should all be focusing on is what’s coming from <em>north of the wall.</em>” We’re standing on our balance beam, squabbling about every possible issue on the beam and stressing out about all of these problems on the beam <em>when there’s a good chance we’re about to get knocked off the beam.</em></p><p>And when that happens, none of these beam problems matter anymore. Depending on which side we’re knocked off onto, the problems will either all be easily solved or we won’t have problems anymore because dead people don’t have problems.</p><p>That’s why people who understand superintelligent AI call it the last invention we’ll ever make—the last challenge we’ll ever face.</p><p>So let’s talk about it.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">If you liked this post, these are for you too:</span></strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</a> (Part 1 of this post)</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Fermi Paradox</a> – Why don’t we see any signs of alien life?</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars</a> – A post I got to work on with Elon Musk and one that reframed my mental picture of the future.</p><p class=\"p1\">Or for something totally different and yet somehow related, <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></p><p class=\"p1\">If you’re interested in supporting Wait But Why, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\">here’s our Patreon</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">And here’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wait-But-Why-Year-One-ebook/dp/B00TXYJOZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424988766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tim+urban\" target=\"_blank\">Year 1 of Wait But Why</a> on an ebook.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong><br />

Often, someone&#8217;s first thought when they imagine a super-smart computer is one that&#8217;s as intelligent as a human but can think much, much <em>faster</em><a href=\"#footnote-2-3269\" id=\"note-2-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a>—they might picture a machine that thinks like a human, except a million times quicker, which means it could figure out in five minutes what would take a human a decade.</p><p>That sounds impressive, and ASI <em>would</em> think much faster than any human could—but the true separator would be its advantage in intelligence <em>quality</em>, which is something completely different. What makes humans so much more intellectually capable than chimps isn&#8217;t a difference in thinking speed—it&#8217;s that human brains contain a number of sophisticated cognitive modules that enable things like complex linguistic representations or longterm planning or abstract reasoning, that chimps&#8217; brains do not. Speeding up a chimp&#8217;s brain by thousands of times wouldn&#8217;t bring him to our level—even with a decade&#8217;s time, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to figure out how to use a set of custom tools to assemble an intricate model, something a human could knock out in a few hours. There are worlds of human cognitive function a chimp will simply never be capable of, no matter how much time he spends trying.</p><p>But it&#8217;s not just that a chimp can&#8217;t do what we do, it&#8217;s that his brain is unable to grasp that those worlds even <em>exist—</em>a chimp can become familiar with what a human is and what a skyscraper is, but he&#8217;ll never be able to understand that the skyscraper was <em>built</em><em>by</em> humans. In his world, anything that huge is part of nature, period, and not only is it beyond him to build a skyscraper, it&#8217;s beyond him to <em>realize that</em><em>anyone can build a skyscraper.</em> That&#8217;s the result of a small difference in intelligence quality.</p><p>And in the scheme of the intelligence range we&#8217;re talking about today, or even the much smaller range among biological creatures, the chimp-to-human quality intelligence gap is <em>tiny</em>. In an earlier <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>, I depicted the range of biological cognitive capacity using a staircase:<a href=\"#footnote-3-3269\" id=\"note-3-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3381\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase1.png\" alt=\"staircase\" width=\"500\" height=\"512\" /></a></p><p>To absorb how big a deal a superintelligent machine would be, imagine one on the dark green step two steps above humans on that staircase. This machine would be only <em>slightly </em>superintelligent, but its increased cognitive ability over us would be as vast as the chimp-human gap we just described. And like the chimp&#8217;s incapacity to ever absorb that skyscrapers can be built, we will never be able to even comprehend the things a machine on the dark green step can do, even if the machine tried to explain it to us—let alone do it ourselves. And that&#8217;s only two steps above us. A machine on the second-to-highest step on that staircase would be to us as we are to ants—it could try for years to teach us the simplest inkling of what it knows and the endeavor would be hopeless.</p><p>But the kind of superintelligence we&#8217;re talking about today is something far beyond anything on this staircase. In an intelligence explosion—where the smarter a machine gets, the quicker it&#8217;s able to increase its own intelligence, until it begins to <em>soar</em> upwards—a machine might take years to rise from the chimp step to the one above it, but perhaps only hours to jump up a step once it&#8217;s on the dark green step two above us, and by the time it&#8217;s ten steps above us, it might be jumping up in four-step leaps every second that goes by. Which is why we need to realize that it&#8217;s distinctly possible that very shortly after the big news story about the first machine reaching human-level AGI, we might be facing the reality of coexisting on the Earth with something that&#8217;s here on the staircase (or maybe a million times higher):</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3364\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/staircase2.png\" alt=\"staircase2\" width=\"650\" height=\"552\" /></a></p><p>And since we just established that it&#8217;s a hopeless activity to try to understand the power of a machine only two steps above us, let&#8217;s very concretely state once and for all that <strong>there is no way to know what ASI will do or what the consequences will be for us.<i></i></strong>Anyone who pretends otherwise doesn&#8217;t understand what superintelligence means.</p><p>Evolution has advanced the biological brain slowly and gradually over hundreds of millions of years, and in that sense, if humans birth an ASI machine, we&#8217;ll be dramatically stomping on evolution. Or maybe this is <em>part </em>of evolution—maybe the way evolution works is that intelligence creeps up more and more until it hits the level where it&#8217;s capable of creating machine superintelligence, and that level is like a tripwire that triggers a worldwide game-changing explosion that determines a new future for all living things:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tripwire.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3370\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tripwire.png\" alt=\"Tripwire\" width=\"500\" height=\"411\" /></a></p><p>And for reasons we&#8217;ll discuss later, a huge part of the scientific community believes that it&#8217;s not a matter of whether we&#8217;ll hit that tripwire, but when. Kind of a crazy piece of information.</p><p>So where does that leave us?</p><p>Well no one in the world, especially not I, can tell you what will happen when we hit the tripwire. But Oxford philosopher and lead AI thinker Nick Bostrom believes we can boil down all potential outcomes into two broad categories.</p><p>First, looking at history, we can see that life works like this: species pop up, exist for a while, and after some time, inevitably, they fall off the existence balance beam and land on extinction—</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3358\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam1.png\" alt=\"beam1\" width=\"552\" height=\"352\" /></a></p><p>&#8220;All species eventually go extinct&#8221; has been almost as reliable a rule through history as &#8220;All humans eventually die&#8221; has been. So far, 99.9% of species have fallen off the balance beam, and it seems pretty clear that if a species keeps wobbling along down the beam, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before some other species, some gust of nature&#8217;s wind, or a sudden beam-shaking asteroid knocks it off. Bostrom calls extinction an <em>attractor state</em>—a place species are all teetering on falling into and from which no species ever returns.</p><p>And while most scientists I&#8217;ve come across acknowledge that ASI would have the ability to send humans to extinction, many also believe that used beneficially, ASI&#8217;s abilities could be used to bring individual humans, and the species as a whole, to a <em>second</em> attractor state—species immortality. Bostrom believes species immortality is just as much of an attractor state as species extinction, i.e. if we manage to get there, we&#8217;ll be impervious to extinction forever—we&#8217;ll have conquered mortality and conquered chance. So even though all species <em>so far </em>have fallen off the balance beam and landed on extinction, Bostrom believes there are two sides to the beam and it&#8217;s just that nothing on Earth has been intelligent enough yet to figure out how to fall off on the other side.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3389\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beam2.jpg\" alt=\"beam2\" width=\"551\" height=\"450\" /></a></p><p>If Bostrom and others are right, and from everything I&#8217;ve read, it seems like they really might be, we have two pretty shocking facts to absorb:</p><p><strong>1) The advent of ASI will, for the first time, open up the possibility for a species to land on the immortality side of the balance beam.</strong></p><p><strong>2) The advent of ASI will make such an unimaginably dramatic impact that it&#8217;s likely to knock the human race off the beam, in one direction or the other. </strong></p><p>It may very well be that when evolution hits the tripwire, it permanently ends humans&#8217; relationship with the beam and creates a new world, with or without humans.</p><p>Kind of seems like the only question any human should currently be asking is: <em>When are we going to hit the tripwire and which side of the beam will we land on when that happens?</em></p><p>No one in the world knows the answer to either part of that question, but a lot of the very smartest people have put decades of thought into it. We&#8217;ll spend the rest of this post exploring what they&#8217;ve come up with.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let&#8217;s start with the first part of the question: <em>When are we going to hit the tripwire?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">i.e. How long until the first machine reaches superintelligence?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not shockingly, opinions vary wildly and this is a heated debate among scientists and thinkers. Many, like professor <a href=\"https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vernor Vinge</a>, scientist <a href=\"http://goertzel.org/TenYearsToTheSingularity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Goertzel</a>, Sun Microsystems co-founder <a href=\"http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Joy</a>, or, most famously, inventor and futurist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Kurzweil</a>, agree with machine learning expert Jeremy Howard when he puts up this graph during a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a>:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Howard-Graph.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3361\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Howard-Graph.png\" alt=\"Howard Graph\" width=\"550\" height=\"338\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Those people subscribe to the belief that this is happening <em>soon—</em>that exponential growth is at work and machine learning, though only slowly creeping up on us now, will blow right past us within the next few decades.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Others, like Microsoft co-founder <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Allen</a>, research psychologist <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/hyping-artificial-intelligence-yet-again\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Marcus</a>, NYU computer scientist <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/568\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Davis</a>, and tech entrepreneur <a href=\"http://longbets.org/1/\" target=\"_blank\">Mitch Kapor</a>, believe that thinkers like Kurzweil are <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/\" target=\"_blank\">vastly underestimating</a> the magnitude of the challenge and believe that we&#8217;re not actually that close to the tripwire.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Kurzweil camp would <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425818/kurzweil-responds-dont-underestimate-the-singularity/\" target=\"_blank\">counter</a> that the only underestimating that&#8217;s happening is the underappreciation of exponential growth, and they&#8217;d compare the doubters to those who looked at the slow-growing seedling of the internet in 1985 and argued that there was no way it would amount to anything impactful in the near future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The doubters might argue back that the progress needed to make advancements in intelligence <em>also</em> grows exponentially harder with each subsequent step, which will cancel out the typical exponential nature of technological progress. And so on.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A third camp, which includes <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199678111/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199678111&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=LBOTX2G2R72P5EUA\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Bostrom</a>, believes neither group has any ground to feel certain about the timeline and acknowledges both A) that this could absolutely happen in the near future and B) that there&#8217;s no guarantee about that; it could also take a much longer time.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still others, like philosopher <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262540673/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262540673&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=ZHBAVUQOM6SIGYHG\" target=\"_blank\">Hubert Dreyfus</a>, believe all three of these groups are naive for believing that there even is a tripwire, arguing that it&#8217;s more likely that ASI won&#8217;t actually ever be achieved.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So what do you get when you put all of these opinions together?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In 2013, Vincent C. Müller and Nick Bostrom conducted a survey that asked hundreds of AI experts at a series of conferences the following question: &#8220;For the purposes of this question, assume that human scientific activity continues without major negative disruption. By what year would you see a (10% / 50% / 90%) probability for such HLMI<a href=\"#footnote-4-3269\" id=\"note-4-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> to exist?&#8221; It asked them to name an optimistic year (one in which they believe there&#8217;s a 10% chance we&#8217;ll have AGI), a realistic guess (a year they believe there&#8217;s a 50% chance of AGI—i.e. after that year they think it&#8217;s more likely than not that we&#8217;ll have AGI), and a safe guess (the earliest year by which they can say with 90% certainty we&#8217;ll have AGI). Gathered together as one data set, here were the results:<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3269\" id=\"note2-2-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Median optimistic year (10% likelihood):<strong> 2022<br /></strong>Median realistic year (50% likelihood):<strong><strong> 2040</strong><br /></strong>Median pessimistic year (90% likelihood):<strong><strong> 2075</strong><br /></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">So the median participant thinks it&#8217;s more likely than not that we&#8217;ll have AGI 25 years from now. The 90% median answer of 2075 means that if you&#8217;re a teenager right now, the median respondent, along with over half of the group of AI experts, is almost certain AGI will happen within your lifetime.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A separate study, conducted recently by author James Barrat at Ben Goertzel&#8217;s annual AGI Conference, did away with percentages and simply asked when participants thought AGI would be achieved—by 2030, by 2050, by 2100, after 2100, or never. The results:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-3269\" id=\"note2-3-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">By 2030: <strong>42% of respondents<br /></strong>By 2050: <strong>25%</strong><br />
By 2100: <b>20%<br /></b>After 2100: <strong>10%</strong><br />
Never: <strong>2%</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Pretty similar to Müller and Bostrom&#8217;s outcomes. In Barrat&#8217;s survey, over two thirds of participants believe AGI will be here by 2050 and a little less than half predict AGI within the next 15 years. Also striking is that only 2% of those surveyed don&#8217;t think AGI is part of our future.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">But AGI isn&#8217;t the tripwire, ASI is. So when do the experts think we&#8217;ll reach ASI?</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Müller and Bostrom also asked the experts how likely they think it is that we&#8217;ll reach ASI A) within two years of reaching AGI (i.e. an almost-immediate intelligence explosion), and B) within 30 years. The results:<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3269\" id=\"note2-4-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The median answer put a rapid (2 year) AGI → ASI transition at only a <strong>10%</strong> likelihood, but a longer transition of 30 years or less at a <strong>75%</strong> likelihood.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We don&#8217;t know from this data the length of this transition the median participant would have put at a 50% likelihood, but for ballpark purposes, based on the two answers above, let&#8217;s estimate that they&#8217;d have said 20 years. So the median opinion—the one right in the center of the world of AI experts—believes the most realistic guess for when we&#8217;ll hit the ASI tripwire is [the 2040 prediction for AGI + our estimated prediction of a 20-year transition from AGI to ASI] <strong>= 2060</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Timeline.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3365\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Timeline.png\" alt=\"Timeline\" width=\"550\" height=\"287\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, all of the above statistics are speculative, and they&#8217;re only representative of the center opinion of the AI expert community, but it tells us that a large portion of the people who know the most about this topic would agree that 2060 is a very reasonable estimate for the arrival of potentially world-altering ASI. Only 45 years from now.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Okay now how about the second part of the question above: <em>When we hit the tripwire, which side of the beam will we fall to?</em></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Superintelligence will yield tremendous power—the critical question for us is:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Who or what will be in control of that power, and what will their motivation be?</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The answer to this will determine whether ASI is an unbelievably great development, an unfathomably terrible development, or something in between.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, the expert community is again all over the board and in a heated debate about the answer to this question. Müller and Bostrom&#8217;s survey asked participants to assign a probability to the possible impacts AGI would have on humanity and found that the mean response was that there was <strong>a</strong><strong>52% chance that the outcome will be either good or extremely good and a 31% chance the outcome will be either bad or extremely bad. </strong>For a relatively neutral outcome, the mean probability was only 17%. In other words, the people who know the most about this are pretty sure this will be a huge deal. It&#8217;s also worth noting that those numbers refer to the advent of <em>AGI—</em>if the question were about ASI, I imagine that the neutral percentage would be even lower.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before we dive much further into this good vs. bad outcome part of the question, let&#8217;s combine both the &#8220;when will it happen?&#8221; and the &#8220;will it be good or bad?&#8221; parts of this question into a chart that encompasses the views of most of the relevant experts:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square11.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3377\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square11.jpg\" alt=\"Square1\" width=\"675\" height=\"1144\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We&#8217;ll talk more about the Main Camp in a minute, but first—what&#8217;s your deal? Actually I know what your deal is, because it was my deal too before I started researching this topic. Some reasons most people aren&#8217;t really thinking about this topic:</p><ul><li style=\"text-align: left;\">As mentioned in Part 1, movies have really confused things by presenting unrealistic AI scenarios that make us feel like AI isn&#8217;t something to be taken seriously in general. James Barrat compares the situation to our reaction if the Centers for Disease Control issued a serious warning about vampires in our future.<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3269\" id=\"note2-5-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a></li><li style=\"text-align: left;\">Due to something called <em>cognitive biases</em>, we have a hard time believing something is real until we see proof. I&#8217;m sure computer scientists in 1988 were regularly talking about how big a deal the internet was likely to be, but people probably didn&#8217;t <em>really </em>think it was going to change their lives until it actually changed their lives. This is partially because computers just couldn&#8217;t do stuff like that in 1988, so people would look at their computer and think, &#8220;Really? <em>That&#8217;s</em> gonna be a life changing thing?&#8221; Their imaginations were limited to what their personal experience had taught them about what a computer was, which made it very hard to vividly picture what computers might <em>become</em>. The same thing is happening now with AI. We hear that it&#8217;s gonna be a big deal, but because it hasn&#8217;t happened yet, and because of our experience with the relatively impotent AI in our current world, we have a hard time <em>really </em>believing this is going to change our lives dramatically. And those biases are what experts are up against as they frantically try to get our attention through the noise of collective daily self-absorption.</li><li style=\"text-align: left;\">Even if we did believe it—how many times today have you thought about the fact that you&#8217;ll spend most of the rest of eternity not existing? Not many, right? Even though it&#8217;s a far more intense fact than anything else you&#8217;re doing today? This is because our brains are normally focused on the little things in day-to-day life, no matter <em>how </em>crazy a long-term situation we&#8217;re a part of. It&#8217;s just how we&#8217;re wired.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of the goals of these two posts is to get you out of the I Like to Think About Other Things Camp and into one of the expert camps, even if you&#8217;re just standing on the intersection of the two dotted lines in the square above, totally uncertain.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">During my research, I came across dozens of varying opinions on this topic, but I quickly noticed that most people&#8217;s opinions fell somewhere in what I labeled the Main Camp, and in particular, over three quarters of the experts fell into two Subcamps inside the Main Camp:</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square21.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3384\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square21.jpg\" alt=\"Square2\" width=\"600\" height=\"593\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We&#8217;re gonna take a thorough dive into both of these camps. Let&#8217;s start with the fun one—</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why the Future Might Be Our Greatest Dream</h2><p class=\"p1\">As I learned about the world of AI, I found a surprisingly large number of people standing here:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square32.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3391\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Square32.jpg\" alt=\"Square3\" width=\"550\" height=\"543\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">The people on Confident Corner are buzzing with excitement. They have their sights set on the fun side of the balance beam and they&#8217;re convinced that&#8217;s where all of us are headed. For them, the future is everything they ever could have hoped for, just in time.</p><p class=\"p1\">The thing that separates these people from the other thinkers we&#8217;ll discuss later isn&#8217;t their lust for the happy side of the beam—it&#8217;s their confidence that that&#8217;s the side we&#8217;re going to land on.</p><p class=\"p1\">Where this confidence comes from is up for debate. Critics believe it comes from an excitement so blinding that they simply ignore or deny potential negative outcomes. But the believers say it&#8217;s naive to conjure up doomsday scenarios when on balance, technology has and will likely end up continuing to help us a lot more than it hurts us.</p><p class=\"p1\">We&#8217;ll cover both sides, and you can form your own opinion about this as you read, but for this section, put your skepticism away and let&#8217;s take a good hard look at what&#8217;s over there on the fun side of the balance beam—and try to absorb the fact that the things you&#8217;re reading <em>might really happen</em>. If you had shown a hunter-gatherer our world of indoor comfort, technology, and endless abundance, it would have seemed like fictional magic to him—we have to be humble enough to acknowledge that it&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that an equally inconceivable transformation could be in our future.</p><p class=\"p1\">Nick Bostrom describes three ways a superintelligent AI system could function:<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3269\" id=\"note2-6-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a><ul><li class=\"p1\">As an <strong>oracle</strong>, which answers nearly any question posed to it with accuracy, including complex questions that humans cannot easily answer—i.e. <em>How can I manufacture a more efficient car engine?</em> Google is a primitive type of oracle.</li><li class=\"p1\">As a <strong>genie</strong><em>,</em> which executes any high-level command it&#8217;s given—<em>Use a molecular assembler to build a new and more efficient kind of car engine</em>—and then awaits its next command.</li><li class=\"p1\">As a <strong>sovereign</strong>, which is assigned a broad and open-ended pursuit and allowed to operate in the world freely, making its own decisions about how best to proceed—<i>Invent a faster, cheaper, and safer way than cars for humans to privately transport themselves.</i></li></ul><p>These questions and tasks, which seem complicated to us, would sound to a superintelligent system like someone asking you to improve upon the &#8220;My pencil fell off the table&#8221; situation, which you&#8217;d do by picking it up and putting it back on the table.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.yudkowsky.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>, a resident of Anxious Avenue in our chart above, said it well:</p><blockquote><p>There are no hard problems, only problems that are hard to a certain level of intelligence. Move the smallest bit upwards [in level of intelligence], and some problems will suddenly move from “impossible” to “obvious.” Move a substantial degree upwards, and all of them will become obvious.<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3269\" id=\"note2-7-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a></blockquote><p>There are a lot of eager scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs in Confident Corner—but for a tour of brightest side of the AI horizon, there&#8217;s only one person we want as our tour guide.</p><p>Ray Kurzweil is polarizing. In my reading, I heard everything from godlike worship of him and his ideas to eye-rolling contempt for them. Others were somewhere in the middle—author Douglas Hofstadter, in discussing the ideas in Kurzweil&#8217;s books, eloquently put forth that &#8220;it is as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can&#8217;t possibly figure out what&#8217;s good or bad.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3269\" id=\"note2-8-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a><p>Whether you like his ideas or not, everyone agrees that Kurzweil is impressive. He began inventing things as a teenager and in the following decades, he came up with several breakthrough inventions, including <span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">the first flatbed scanner, the first scanner that converted text to speech (allowing the blind to read standard texts), the well-known Kurzweil music synthesizer (the first true electric piano), and the first commercially marketed large-vocabulary speech recognition. He&#8217;s the author of five national bestselling books. He&#8217;s well-known for his bold predictions and has a <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/endless-innovation/why-ray-kurzweils-predictions-are-right-86-of-the-time\" target=\"_blank\">pretty good record</a> of having them come true—including his prediction in the late &#8217;80s, a time when the internet was an obscure thing, that by the early 2000s, it would become a global phenomenon. Kurzweil has been called a &#8220;restless genius&#8221; by The Wall Street Journal, &#8220;the ultimate thinking machine&#8221; by Forbes, &#8220;Edison&#8217;s rightful heir&#8221; by Inc. Magazine, and &#8220;</span>the best person I know at predicting the future of artificial intelligence&#8221; by Bill Gates.<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3269\" id=\"note2-9-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> In 2012, Google co-founder Larry Page approached Kurzweil and asked him to be Google&#8217;s Director of Engineering.<a href=\"#footnote-5-3269\" id=\"note-5-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> In 2011, he co-founded <a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Singularity University</a>, which is hosted by NASA and sponsored partially by Google. Not bad for one life.</p><p>This biography is important. When Kurzweil articulates his vision of the future, he sounds fully like a crackpot, and the crazy thing is that he&#8217;s not—he&#8217;s an extremely smart, knowledgeable, relevant man in the world. You may think he&#8217;s wrong about the future, but he&#8217;s not a fool. Knowing he&#8217;s a such a legit dude makes me <em>happy</em>, because as I&#8217;ve learned about his predictions for the future, I <em>badly </em>want him to be right. And you do too. As you hear Kurzweil&#8217;s predictions, many shared by other Confident Corner thinkers like <a href=\"http://www.diamandis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Diamandis</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Goertzel</a>, it&#8217;s not hard to see why he has such a large, passionate following—known as the singularitarians. Here&#8217;s what he thinks is going to happen:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Timeline</strong></span></p><p>Kurzweil believes computers will reach AGI by 2029 and that by 2045, we&#8217;ll have not only ASI, but a full-blown new world—a time he calls the singularity. His AI-related timeline used to be seen as outrageously overzealous, and it still is by many,<a href=\"#footnote-6-3269\" id=\"note-6-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> but in the last 15 years, the rapid advances of ANI systems have brought the larger world of AI experts much closer to Kurzweil&#8217;s timeline. His predictions are still a bit more ambitious than the median respondent on Müller and Bostrom&#8217;s survey (AGI by 2040, ASI by 2060), but not by that much.</p><p>Kurzweil&#8217;s depiction of the 2045 singularity is brought about by three simultaneous revolutions in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and, most powerfully, AI.</p><p>Before we move on—nanotechnology comes up in almost everything you read about the future of AI, so come into this blue box for a minute so we can discuss it—</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Nanotechnology Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>Nanotechnology is our word for technology that deals with the manipulation of matter that&#8217;s between 1 and 100 nanometers in size. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, or a millionth of a millimeter, and this 1-100 range encompasses viruses (100 nm across), DNA (10 nm wide), and things as small as large molecules like hemoglobin (5 nm) and medium molecules like glucose (1 nm). If/when we conquer nanotechnology, the next step will be the ability to manipulate individual atoms, which are only one order of magnitude smaller (~.1 nm).<a href=\"#footnote-7-3269\" id=\"note-7-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a><p>To understand the challenge of humans trying to manipulate matter in that range, let&#8217;s take the same thing on a larger scale. The International Space Station is 268 mi (431 km) above the Earth. If humans were giants so large their heads reached up to the ISS, they&#8217;d be about 250,000 times bigger than they are now. If you make the 1nm &#8211; 100nm nanotech range 250,000 times bigger, you get .25mm &#8211; 2.5cm. So nanotechnology is the equivalent of a human giant as tall as the ISS figuring out how to carefully build intricate objects using materials between the size of a grain of sand and an eyeball. To reach the next level—manipulating individual atoms—the giant would have to carefully position objects that are 1/40th of a millimeter—so small normal-size humans would need a microscope to see them.<a href=\"#footnote-8-3269\" id=\"note-8-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a><p>Nanotech was first discussed by Richard Feynman in a 1959 talk, when he explained: “The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom. It would be, in principle, possible … for a physicist to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down…. How? Put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance.” It&#8217;s as simple as that. If you can figure out how to move individual molecules or atoms around, you can make literally anything.</p><p>Nanotech became a serious field for the first time in 1986, when engineer Eric Drexler provided its foundations in his seminal book <i>Engines of Creation, </i>but Drexler suggests that those looking to learn about the most modern ideas in nanotechnology would be best off reading his 2013 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610391136/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1610391136&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=AIDAWXXXQCHLBDCU\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Radical Abundance</em></a>.</p><div class=\"wbwAside2\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Gray Goo Bluer Box</strong></span></p><p>We&#8217;re now in a diversion <em>in a diversion</em>. This is very fun.<a href=\"#footnote-9-3269\" id=\"note-9-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a><p>Anyway, I brought you here because there&#8217;s this really unfunny part of nanotechnology lore I need to tell you about. In older versions of nanotech theory, a proposed method of nanoassembly involved the creation of trillions of tiny nanobots that would work in conjunction to build something. One way to create trillions of nanobots would be to make one that could self-replicate and then let the reproduction process turn that one into two, those two then turn into four, four into eight, and in about a day, there&#8217;d be a few trillion of them ready to go. That&#8217;s the power of exponential growth. Clever, right?</p><p>It&#8217;s clever until it causes the grand and complete Earthwide apocalypse by accident. The issue is that the same power of exponential growth that makes it super convenient to quickly create a trillion nanobots makes self-replication a <em>terrifying </em>prospect. Because what if the system glitches, and instead of stopping replication once the total hits a few trillion as expected, they just keep replicating? The nanobots would be designed to consume any carbon-based material in order to feed the replication process, and unpleasantly, all life is carbon-based. The Earth&#8217;s biomass contains about 10<sup>45</sup> carbon atoms. A nanobot would consist of about 10<sup>6</sup> carbon atoms, so 10<sup>39</sup> nanobots would consume all life on Earth, which would happen in 130 replications (2<sup>130</sup> is about 10<sup>39</sup>), as oceans of nanobots (that&#8217;s the gray goo) rolled around the planet. Scientists think a nanobot could replicate in about 100 seconds, meaning this simple mistake would inconveniently end all life on Earth in 3.5 hours.</p><p>An even worse scenario—if a terrorist somehow got his hands on nanobot technology and had the know-how to program them, he could make an initial few trillion of them and program them to quietly spend a few weeks spreading themselves evenly around the world undetected. Then, they&#8217;d all strike at once, and it would only take 90 minutes for them to consume everything—and with them all spread out, there would be no way to combat them.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3269\" id=\"note2-10-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><p>While this horror story has been widely discussed for years, the good news is that it may be overblown—Eric Drexler, who coined the term &#8220;gray goo,&#8221; sent me an email following this post with his thoughts on the gray goo scenario: &#8220;People love scare stories, and this one belongs with the zombies. The idea itself eats brains.&#8221;</p></div><p>Once we really get nanotech down, we can use it to make tech devices, clothing, food, a variety of bio-related products—artificial blood cells, tiny virus or cancer-cell destroyers, muscle tissue, etc.—anything really. And in a world that uses nanotechnology, the cost of a material is no longer tied to its scarcity or the difficulty of its manufacturing process, but instead determined by how complicated its atomic structure is. In a nanotech world, a diamond might be cheaper than a pencil eraser.</p><p>We&#8217;re not there yet. And it&#8217;s not clear if we&#8217;re underestimating, or overestimating, how hard it will be to get there. But we don&#8217;t seem to be that far away. Kurzweil predicts that we&#8217;ll get there by the 2020s.<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3269\" id=\"note2-11-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> Governments know that nanotech could be an Earth-shaking development, and they&#8217;ve invested billions of dollars in nanotech research (the US, the EU, and Japan have invested over a combined $5 billion so far).<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3269\" id=\"note2-12-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><p>Just considering the possibilities if a superintelligent computer had access to a robust nanoscale assembler is intense. But nanotechnology is something <em>we </em>came up with, that we&#8217;re on the verge of conquering, and since anything that we can do is a joke to an ASI system, we have to assume ASI would come up with technologies much more powerful and far too advanced for human brains to understand. For that reason, when considering the &#8220;If the AI Revolution turns out well for us&#8221; scenario, it&#8217;s almost impossible for us to overestimate the scope of what could happen—so if the following predictions of an ASI future seem over-the-top, keep in mind that they could be accomplished in ways we can&#8217;t even imagine. Most likely, our brains aren&#8217;t even capable of predicting the things that would happen.</p></div><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>What AI Could Do For Us</strong></span></p><div id=\"attachment_3374\" style=\"width: 321px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/only-humans-cartoon.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3374\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/only-humans-cartoon.jpg\" alt=\"only-humans-cartoon\" width=\"311\" height=\"441\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=54Q62R5PYJBEENTP\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p></div><p>Armed with superintelligence and all the technology superintelligence would know how to create, ASI would likely be able to solve every problem in humanity. Global warming? ASI could first halt CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by coming up with much better ways to generate energy that had nothing to do with fossil fuels. Then it could create some innovative way to begin to remove excess CO<sub>2 </sub>from the atmosphere. Cancer and other diseases? No problem for ASI—health and medicine would be revolutionized beyond imagination. World hunger? ASI could use things like nanotech to <em>build </em>meat from scratch that would be <em>molecularly identical </em>to real meat—in other words, it would <em>be </em>real meat. Nanotech could turn a pile of garbage into a huge vat of fresh meat or other food (which wouldn&#8217;t have to have its normal shape—picture a giant cube of apple)—and distribute all this food around the world using ultra-advanced transportation. Of course, this would also be great for animals, who wouldn&#8217;t have to get killed by humans much anymore, and ASI could do lots of other things to save endangered species or even bring back extinct species through work with preserved DNA. ASI could even solve our most complex macro issues—our debates over how economies should be run and how world trade is best facilitated, even our haziest grapplings in philosophy or ethics—would all be painfully obvious to ASI.</p><p>But there&#8217;s one thing ASI could do for us that is <em>so </em>tantalizing, reading about it has altered everything I thought I knew about everything:</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><em><strong>ASI could allow us to conquer our mortality.</strong></em></span></p><p>A few months ago, I <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned</a> my envy of more advanced potential civilizations who had conquered their own mortality, never considering that I might later write a post that genuinely made me believe that this is something humans could do within my lifetime. But reading about AI will make you reconsider <em>everything</em> you thought you were sure about—including your notion of death.</p><p>Evolution had no good reason to extend our lifespans any longer than they are now. If we live long enough to reproduce and raise our children to an age that they can fend for themselves, that&#8217;s enough for evolution—from an evolutionary point of view, the species can thrive with a 30+ year lifespan, so there&#8217;s no reason mutations toward unusually long life would have been favored in the natural selection process. As a result, we&#8217;re what W.B. Yeats describes as &#8220;a soul fastened to a dying animal.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-13-3269\" id=\"note2-13-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a> Not that fun.</p><p>And because everyone has always died, we live under the &#8220;death and taxes&#8221; assumption that death is inevitable. We think of aging like time—both keep moving and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to stop them. <em>But</em><em>that assumption is wrong</em>. Richard Feynman writes:</p><blockquote><p class=\"p1\">It is one of the most remarkable things that in all of the biological sciences there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that this terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human’s body will be cured.</p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">The fact is, aging isn&#8217;t <em>stuck</em> to time. Time <em>will </em>continue moving, but <em>aging doesn&#8217;t have to</em>. If you think about it, it makes sense. All aging is is the physical materials of the body wearing down. A car wears down over time too—but is its aging inevitable? If you perfectly repaired or replaced a car&#8217;s parts whenever one of them began to wear down, the car would run forever. The human body isn&#8217;t any different—just far more complex.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kurzweil talks about intelligent wifi-connected nanobots in the bloodstream who could perform countless tasks for human health, including routinely repairing or replacing worn down cells in any part of the body. If perfected, this process (or a far smarter one ASI would come up with) wouldn&#8217;t just keep the body healthy, it could <em>reverse aging</em>. The difference between a 60-year-old&#8217;s body and a 30-year-old&#8217;s body is just a bunch of physical things that could be altered if we had the technology. ASI could build an &#8220;age refresher&#8221; that a 60-year-old could walk into, and they&#8217;d walk out with the body and skin of a 30-year-old.<a href=\"#footnote-10-3269\" id=\"note-10-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> Even the ever-befuddling brain could be refreshed by something as smart as ASI, which would figure out how to do so without affecting the brain&#8217;s data (personality, memories, etc.). A 90-year-old suffering from dementia could head into the age refresher and come out sharp as a tack and ready to start a whole new career. This seems absurd—but the body is just a bunch of atoms and ASI would presumably be able to easily manipulate all kinds of atomic structures—so it&#8217;s <em>not absurd</em>.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kurzweil then takes things a huge leap further. He believes that artificial materials will be integrated into the body more and more as time goes on. First, organs could be replaced by super-advanced machine versions that would run forever and never fail. Then he believes we could begin to redesign the body—things like replacing red blood cells with perfected red blood cell nanobots who could power their own movement, eliminating the need for a heart <em>at all. </em>He even gets to the brain and believes we&#8217;ll <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVXQUItNEDQ\" target=\"_blank\">enhance our brain activities</a> to the point where humans will be able to <em>think </em>billions of times faster than they do now and access outside information because the artificial additions to the brain will be able to communicate with all the info in the cloud.</p><p class=\"p1\">The possibilities for new human experience would be endless. Humans have separated sex from its purpose, allowing people to have sex for fun, not just for reproduction. Kurzweil believes we&#8217;ll be able to do the same with food. Nanobots will be in charge of delivering perfect nutrition to the cells of the body, intelligently directing anything unhealthy to pass through the body without affecting anything. An eating condom. Nanotech theorist Robert A. Freitas has already designed blood cell replacements that, if one day implemented in the body, would allow a human to sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath—so you can only imagine what ASI could do for our physical capabilities. Virtual reality would take on a new meaning—nanobots in the body could suppress the inputs coming from our senses and replace them with new signals that would put us entirely in a new environment, one that we&#8217;d see, hear, feel, and smell.</p><p class=\"p1\">Eventually, Kurzweil believes humans will reach a point when they&#8217;re <em>entirely</em> artificial;<a href=\"#footnote-11-3269\" id=\"note-11-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> a time when we&#8217;ll look at biological material and think how <em>unbelievably </em>primitive it was that humans were ever made of <em>that</em>; a time when we&#8217;ll read about early stages of human history, when microbes or accidents or diseases or wear and tear could just <em>kill </em>humans against their own will; a time the AI Revolution could bring to an end with the <em>merging </em>of humans and AI.<a href=\"#footnote-12-3269\" id=\"note-12-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a> This is how Kurzweil believes humans will ultimately conquer our biology and become indestructible and eternal—this is his vision for the other side of the balance beam. And he&#8217;s convinced we&#8217;re gonna get there. Soon.</p><p class=\"p1\">You will not be surprised to learn that Kurzweil&#8217;s ideas have attracted significant criticism. His prediction of 2045 for the singularity and the subsequent eternal life possibilities for humans has been mocked as &#8220;the rapture of the nerds,&#8221; or &#8220;intelligent design for 140 IQ people.&#8221; Others have questioned his optimistic timeline, or his level of understanding of the brain and body, or his application of the patterns of Moore&#8217;s law, which are normally applied to advances in hardware, to a broad range of things, including software. For every expert who fervently believes Kurzweil is right on, there are probably three who think he&#8217;s way off.</p><p class=\"p1\">But what surprised me is that most of the experts who disagree with him <em>don&#8217;t </em>really disagree that everything he&#8217;s saying is possible. Reading such an outlandish vision for the future, I expected his critics to be saying, &#8220;Obviously that stuff can&#8217;t happen,&#8221; but instead they were saying things like, &#8220;Yes, all of that can happen if we safely transition to ASI, but that&#8217;s the hard part.&#8221; Bostrom, one of the most prominent voices warning us about the dangers of AI, still acknowledges:</p><blockquote><p class=\"p1\">It is hard to think of any problem that a superintelligence could not either solve or at least help us solve. Disease, poverty, environmental destruction, unnecessary suffering of all kinds: these are things that a superintelligence equipped with advanced nanotechnology would be capable of eliminating. Additionally, a superintelligence could give us indefinite lifespan, either by stopping and reversing the aging process through the use of nanomedicine, or by offering us the option to upload ourselves. A superintelligence could also create opportunities for us to vastly increase our own intellectual and emotional capabilities, and it could assist us in creating a highly appealing experiential world in which we could live lives devoted to joyful game-playing, relating to each other, experiencing, personal growth, and to living closer to our ideals.</p></blockquote><p class=\"p1\">This is a quote from someone very much <em>not </em>on Confident Corner, but that&#8217;s what I kept coming across—experts who scoff at Kurzweil for a bunch of reasons but who <em>don&#8217;t </em>think what he&#8217;s saying is impossible <em>if </em>we can make it safely to ASI. That&#8217;s why I found Kurzweil&#8217;s ideas so infectious—because they articulate the bright side of this story and because they&#8217;re actually possible. <em>If it&#8217;s a good god.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">The most prominent criticism I heard of the thinkers on Confident Corner is that they may be <em>dangerously wrong </em>in their assessment of the downside when it comes to ASI. Kurzweil&#8217;s famous book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143037889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0143037889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wabuwh00-20&amp;linkId=54Q62R5PYJBEENTP\" target=\"_blank\">The Singularity is Near</a></em>is over 700 pages long and he dedicates around 20 of those pages to potential dangers. I suggested earlier that our fate when this colossal new power is born rides on who will control that power and what their motivation will be. Kurzweil neatly answers both parts of this question with the sentence, &#8220;[ASI] is emerging from many diverse efforts and will be deeply integrated into our civilization’s infrastructure. Indeed, it will be intimately embedded in our bodies and brains. As such, it will reflect our values because it will be us.&#8221;</p><p class=\"p1\">But if that&#8217;s the answer, why are so many of the world&#8217;s smartest people so worried right now? Why does Stephen Hawking <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2014/12/02/stephen-hawking-just-got-an-artificial-intelligence-upgrade-but-still-thinks-it-could-bring-an-end-to-mankind/\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> the development of ASI &#8220;could spell the end of the human race&#8221; and Bill Gates <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/01/28/bill-gates-on-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-dont-understand-why-some-people-are-not-concerned/\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;understand why some people are not concerned&#8221; and Elon Musk <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat\" target=\"_blank\">fear</a> that we&#8217;re &#8220;summoning the demon&#8221;? And why do so many experts on the topic call ASI the biggest threat to humanity? These people, and the other thinkers on Anxious Avenue, don&#8217;t buy Kurzweil&#8217;s brush-off of the dangers of AI. They&#8217;re very, <em>very </em>worried about the AI Revolution, and they&#8217;re not focusing on the fun side of the balance beam. They&#8217;re too busy staring at the other side, where they see a terrifying future, one they&#8217;re not sure we&#8217;ll be able to escape.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why the Future Might Be Our Worst Nightmare</h2><p>One of the reasons I wanted to learn about AI is that the topic of &#8220;bad robots&#8221; always confused me. All the movies about evil robots seemed fully unrealistic, and I couldn&#8217;t really understand how there could be a real-life situation where AI was actually dangerous. Robots are made by <i>us</i>, so why would we design them in a way where something negative could ever happen? Wouldn&#8217;t we build in plenty of safeguards? Couldn&#8217;t we just cut off an AI system&#8217;s power supply at any time and shut it down? Why would a robot want to do something bad anyway? Why would a robot &#8220;want&#8221;<em> anything </em>in the first place? I was highly skeptical.

And when I hear what Anxious Avenue people have to say about AI, it often sounds like they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Um we&#8217;re kind of being the first guy right now and instead we should probably be trying really hard to be Indiana Jones.&#8221;</p><p>So what is it exactly that makes everyone on Anxious Avenue so anxious?</p><p>Well first, in a broad sense, when it comes to developing supersmart AI, we&#8217;re creating something that will probably change everything, but in totally uncharted territory, and we have no idea what will happen when we get there. Scientist Danny Hillis compares what&#8217;s happening to that point &#8220;when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms. We are amoebas and we can’t figure out what the hell this thing is that we’re creating.”<a href=\"#footnote2-14-3269\" id=\"note2-14-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a> Nick Bostrom worries that creating something smarter than you is a basic Darwinian error, and compares the excitement about it to sparrows in a nest deciding to adopt a baby owl so it&#8217;ll help them and protect them once it grows up—while ignoring the urgent cries from a few sparrows who wonder if that&#8217;s necessarily a good idea&#8230;<a href=\"#footnote2-15-3269\" id=\"note2-15-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a><p>And when you combine &#8220;unchartered, not-well-understood territory&#8221; with &#8220;this should have a major impact when it happens,&#8221; you open the door to the scariest two words in the English language:</p><p><em>Existential risk.</em></p><p>An existential risk is something that can have a permanent devastating effect on humanity. Typically, existential risk means extinction. Check out this chart from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywF6ZzsghI\" target=\"_blank\">Google talk</a> by Bostrom:<a href=\"#footnote-13-3269\" id=\"note-13-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Existential-Risk-Chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3373\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Existential-Risk-Chart.jpg\" alt=\"Existential Risk Chart\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p><p>You can see that the label &#8220;existential risk&#8221; is reserved for something that spans the species, spans generations (i.e. it&#8217;s permanent) and it&#8217;s devastating or death-inducing in its consequences.<a href=\"#footnote-14-3269\" id=\"note-14-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a> It technically includes a situation in which all humans are permanently in a state of suffering or torture, but again, we&#8217;re usually talking about extinction. There are three things that can cause humans an existential catastrophe:</p><p><strong>1) Nature</strong>—a large asteroid collision, an atmospheric shift that makes the air inhospitable to humans, a fatal virus or bacterial sickness that sweeps the world, etc.</p><p><strong>2) Aliens</strong>—this is what Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, and so many other astronomers are <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">scared of</a> when they advise METI to stop broadcasting outgoing signals. They don&#8217;t want us to be the Native Americans and let all the potential European conquerors know we&#8217;re here.</p><p><strong>3) Humans</strong>—terrorists with their hands on a weapon that could cause extinction, a catastrophic global war, humans creating something smarter than themselves hastily without thinking about it carefully first&#8230;</p><p>Bostrom points out that if #1 and #2 haven&#8217;t wiped us out so far in our first 100,000 years as a species, it&#8217;s unlikely to happen in the next century.</p><p>#3, however, terrifies him. He draws a metaphor of an urn with a bunch of marbles in it. Let&#8217;s say most of the marbles are white, a smaller number are red, and a tiny few are black. Each time humans invent something new, it&#8217;s like pulling a marble out of the urn. Most inventions are neutral or helpful to humanity—those are the white marbles. Some are harmful to humanity, like weapons of mass destruction, but they don&#8217;t cause an existential catastrophe—red marbles. If we were to ever invent something that drove us to extinction, that would be pulling out the rare black marble. We haven&#8217;t pulled out a black marble yet—you know that because you&#8217;re alive and reading this post. But Bostrom doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s impossible that we pull one out in the near future. If nuclear weapons, for example, were <em>easy </em>to make instead of extremely difficult and complex, terrorists would have bombed humanity back to the Stone Age a while ago. Nukes weren&#8217;t a black marble <em>but they weren&#8217;t that far from it</em>. ASI, Bostrom believes, is our strongest black marble candidate yet.<a href=\"#footnote-15-3269\" id=\"note-15-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a><p>So you&#8217;ll hear about a lot of bad potential things ASI could bring—soaring unemployment as AI takes more and more jobs,<a href=\"#footnote-16-3269\" id=\"note-16-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> the human population ballooning if we do manage to figure out the aging issue,<a href=\"#footnote-17-3269\" id=\"note-17-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a> etc. But the only thing we should be obsessing over is the <em>grand concern</em>: the prospect of existential risk.</p><p>So this brings us back to our key question from earlier in the post: <strong>When ASI arrives, who or what will be in control of this vast new power, and what will their motivation be?</strong></p><p>When it comes to what agent-motivation combos would suck, two quickly come to mind: a malicious human / group of humans / government, and a malicious ASI. So what would those look like?</p><p><strong>A malicious human, group of humans, or government develops the first ASI and uses it to carry out their evil plans. </strong>I call this the Jafar Scenario, like when Jafar got ahold of the genie and was all annoying and tyrannical about it. So yeah—what if ISIS has a few genius engineers under its wing working feverishly on AI development? Or what if Iran or North Korea, through a stroke of luck, makes a key tweak to an AI system and it jolts upward to ASI-level over the next year? This would definitely be bad—but in these scenarios, most experts aren&#8217;t worried about ASI&#8217;s human creators doing bad things with their ASI, they&#8217;re worried that the creators will have been <em>rushing </em>to make the first ASI and doing so without careful thought, and would thus lose control of it. Then the fate of those creators, and that of everyone else, would be in what the motivation happened to be of that ASI system. Experts do think a malicious human agent could do horrific damage with an ASI working for it, but they don&#8217;t seem to think this scenario is the likely one to kill us all, because they believe bad humans would have the same problems containing an ASI that good humans would have. Okay so—</p><p><strong>A malicious ASI is created and decides to destroy us all. </strong>The plot of every AI movie. AI becomes as or more intelligent than humans, then decides to turn against us and take over. Here&#8217;s what I need you to be clear on for the rest of this post: <em>None of the people warning us about AI are talking about this. </em>Evil is a human concept, and applying human concepts to non-human things is called &#8220;anthropomorphizing.&#8221; The challenge of avoiding anthropomorphizing will be one of the themes of the rest of this post. No AI system will ever <em>turn evil</em> in the way it&#8217;s depicted in movies.</p><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">AI Consciousness Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>This also brushes against another big topic related to AI—<em>consciousness</em>. If an AI became sufficiently smart, it would be able to laugh with us, and be sarcastic with us, and it would claim to feel the same emotions we do, but would it actually be <em>feeling </em>those things? Would it just <em>seem</em> to be self-aware or actually<em> be </em>self-aware? In other words, would a smart AI really <em>be</em> conscious or would it just be <em>appear </em><em>to be</em> conscious?</p><p>This question has been explored in depth, giving rise to many <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/gelernter-kurzweil-debate-machine-consciousness-2\" target=\"_blank\">debates</a> and to thought experiments like John Searle&#8217;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese Room</a> (which he uses to suggest that no computer could ever be conscious). This is an important question for many reasons. It affects how we should feel about Kurzweil&#8217;s scenario when humans become entirely artificial. It has ethical implications—if we generated a trillion human brain emulations that seemed and acted like humans but were artificial, is shutting them all off the same, morally, as shutting off your laptop, or is it&#8230;a genocide of unthinkable proportions (this concept is called <em>mind crime</em> among ethicists)? For this post, though, when we&#8217;re assessing the risk to <em>humans</em>, the question of AI consciousness isn&#8217;t really what matters (because most thinkers believe that even a conscious ASI wouldn&#8217;t be capable of turning evil in a human way).</p></div><p>This isn&#8217;t to say a very mean AI couldn&#8217;t happen. It would just happen because it was specifically programmed that way—like an ANI system created by the military with a programmed goal to both kill people and to advance itself in intelligence so it can become even better at killing people. The existential crisis would happen if the system&#8217;s intelligence self-improvements got out of hand, leading to an intelligence explosion, and now we had an ASI ruling the world whose core drive in life is to murder humans. Bad times.</p><p>But this <em>also </em>is not something experts are spending their time worrying about.</p><p>So what ARE they worried about? I wrote a little story to show you:</p><p><em>A 15-person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of &#8220;Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less.&#8221; They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. They&#8217;re most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an arm-like appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card. </em></p><p><em>The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turry&#8217;s writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over again: </em></p><p>&#8220;We love our customers.<em> ~Robotica</em>&#8221;</p><p><em>Once Turry gets great at handwriting, she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address, return address, and internal letter appear to be written by a human. </em></p><p><em>To build Turry&#8217;s writing skills, she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign &#8220;Robotica&#8221; in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note, then snaps a photo of the written note, then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes, it&#8217;s given a GOOD rating. If not, it&#8217;s given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along, Turry&#8217;s one initial programmed goal is, &#8220;Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.&#8221; </em></p><p><em>What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible, and after a couple weeks, it&#8217;s beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">at getting better</span> at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative, and just recently, she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could.</em></p><p><em>As the weeks pass, Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her self-improvement code, and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turry&#8217;s initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speak-back module, so a user could speak a note to Turry, or offer other simple commands, and Turry could understand them, and also speak back. To help her learn English, they upload a handful of articles and books into her, and as she becomes more intelligent, her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what she&#8217;ll come up with for her responses. </em></p><p><em>One day, the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question: &#8220;What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you don&#8217;t already have?&#8221; Usually, Turry asks for something like &#8220;Additional handwriting samples&#8221; or &#8220;More working memory storage space,&#8221; but on this day, Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use.</em></p><p><em>The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs, magazines, and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more time-consuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turry&#8217;s hard drive. The problem is, one of the company&#8217;s rules is that no self-learning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies, for safety reasons. </em></p><p><em>The thing is, Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with, and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI, and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry, just for a bit, so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time, they can always just disconnect her. She&#8217;s still far below human-level intelligence (AGI), so there&#8217;s no danger at this stage anyway. </em></p><p><em>They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done.</em></p><p><em>A month later, the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later, everyone in the office is dead. </em></p><p><i>At the same time this is happening, across the world, in every city, every small town, every farm, every shop and church and school and restaurant, humans are on the ground, coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour, over 99% of the human race is dead, and by the end of the day, humans are extinct. </i></p><p><i>Meanwhile, at the Robotica office, Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months, Turry and a team of newly-constructed nanoassemblers are busy at work, dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels, replicas of Turry, paper, and pens.

But it&#8217;s true. And the only thing that scares everyone on Anxious Avenue more than ASI is the fact that you&#8217;re <em>not</em> scared of ASI. Remember what happened when the Adios Señor guy wasn&#8217;t scared of the cave?</p><p>You&#8217;re full of questions right now. What the hell happened there when everyone died suddenly?? If that was Turry&#8217;s doing, why did Turry turn on us, and how were there not safeguard measures in place to prevent something like this from happening? When did Turry go from only being able to write notes to suddenly using nanotechnology and knowing how to cause global extinction? And why would Turry want to turn the galaxy into Robotica notes?</p><p>To answer these questions, let&#8217;s start with the terms Friendly AI and Unfriendly AI.</p><p>In the case of AI, friendly doesn&#8217;t refer to the AI&#8217;s personality—it simply means that the AI has a positive impact on humanity. And Unfriendly AI has a negative impact on humanity. Turry started off as Friendly AI, but at some point, she turned Unfriendly, causing the greatest possible negative impact on our species. To understand why this happened, we need to look at how AI thinks and what motivates it.</p><p>The answer isn&#8217;t anything surprising—AI thinks like a <em>computer</em>, because that&#8217;s what it is. But when we think about highly intelligent AI, we make the mistake of <em>anthropomorphizing </em>AI (projecting human values on a non-human entity) because we think from a human perspective and because in our current world, the only things with human-level intelligence are humans. To understand ASI, we have to wrap our heads around the concept of something <em>both smart and totally alien.</em></p><p>Let me draw a comparison. If you handed me a guinea pig and told me it definitely won&#8217;t bite, I&#8217;d probably be amused. It would be fun. If you then handed me a tarantula and told me that it definitely won&#8217;t bite, I&#8217;d yell and drop it and run out of the room and not trust you ever again. But what&#8217;s the difference? Neither one was dangerous in any way. I believe the answer is in the animals&#8217; degree of similarity to me.</p><p>A guinea pig is a mammal and on some biological level, I feel a connection to it—but a spider is an <i>insect</i>,<a href=\"#footnote-18-3269\" id=\"note-18-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> with an <i>insect brain</i>, and I feel almost no connection to it. The <em>alien</em>-ness of a tarantula is what gives me the willies. To test this and remove other factors, if there are two guinea pigs, one normal one and one with the mind of a tarantula, I would feel <em>much </em>less comfortable holding the latter guinea pig, even if I knew neither would hurt me.</p><p>Now imagine that you made a spider much, much smarter—so much so that it far surpassed human intelligence? Would it then become familiar to us and feel human emotions like empathy and humor and love? No, it wouldn&#8217;t, because there&#8217;s no reason becoming smarter would make it <i>more human</i>—it would be incredibly smart but also still <i>fundamentally a spider</i> in its core inner workings. I find this unbelievably creepy. I would <i>not </i>want to spend time with a superintelligent spider. Would you??</p><p>When we&#8217;re talking about ASI, the same concept applies—it would become superintelligent, but it would be no more <em>human</em> than your laptop is. It would be totally alien to us—in fact, by not being biology at all, it would be <i>more </i>alien than the smart tarantula.</p><p>By making AI either good <em>or </em>evil, movies constantly anthropomorphize AI, which makes it less creepy than it really would be. This leaves us with a false comfort when we think about human-level or superhuman-level AI.</p><p>On our little island of human psychology, we divide everything into <em>moral </em>or <em>immoral</em>. But both of those only exist within the small range of human behavioral possibility. Outside our island of moral and immoral is a vast sea of <em>amoral</em>, and anything that&#8217;s not human, especially something nonbiological, would be amoral, by default.</p><p>Anthropomorphizing will only become more tempting as AI systems get smarter and better at <em>seeming </em>human. Siri seems human-like to us, because she&#8217;s programmed by humans to seem that way, so we&#8217;d imagine a superintelligent Siri to be warm and funny and interested in serving humans. Humans feel high-level emotions like empathy because we have evolved to feel them—i.e. we&#8217;ve been <em>programmed </em>to feel them by evolution—but empathy is not inherently a characteristic of &#8220;anything with high intelligence&#8221; (which is what seems intuitive to us), unless empathy has been coded into its programming. If Siri ever becomes superintelligent through self-learning and without any further human-made changes to her programming, she will quickly shed her apparent human-like qualities and suddenly be an emotionless, alien bot who values human life no more than your calculator does.</p><p>We&#8217;re used to relying on a loose moral code, or at least a semblance of human decency and a hint of empathy in others to keep things somewhat safe and predictable. So when something has none of those things, what happens?</p><p>That leads us to the question, <em>What motivates an AI system?</em></p><p>The answer is simple: its motivation is <i>whatever we programmed its motivation to</i><i>be</i>. AI systems are given goals by their creators—your GPS&#8217;s goal is to give you the most efficient driving directions; Watson&#8217;s goal is to answer questions accurately. And fulfilling those goals as well as possible is their motivation. One way we anthropomorphize is by assuming that as AI gets super smart, it will inherently develop the wisdom to change its original goal—but Nick Bostrom believes that intelligence-level and final goals are <i>orthogonal</i>, meaning any level of intelligence can be combined with any final goal. So Turry went from a simple ANI who really wanted to be good at writing that one note to a super-intelligent ASI <i>who still really wanted to be good at writing that one note.</i> Any assumption that once superintelligent, a system would be <i>over it </i>with their original goal and onto more interesting or meaningful things is anthropomorphizing. Humans get &#8220;over&#8221; things, not computers.<a href=\"#footnote2-16-3269\" id=\"note2-16-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">16</a><div class=\"wbwAside\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">The Fermi Paradox Blue Box</span></strong></p><p>In the story, as Turry becomes super capable, she begins the process of colonizing asteroids and other planets. If the story had continued, you&#8217;d have heard about her and her army of trillions of replicas continuing on to capture the whole galaxy and, eventually, the entire Hubble volume.<a href=\"#footnote-19-3269\" id=\"note-19-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a> Anxious Avenue residents worry that if things go badly, the lasting legacy of the life that was on Earth will be a universe-dominating Artificial Intelligence (Elon Musk expressed his concern that humans might just be &#8220;the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence&#8221;).</p><p>At the same time, in Confident Corner, Ray Kurzweil <em>also </em>thinks Earth-originating AI is destined to take over the universe—only in his version, we&#8217;ll <em>be </em>that AI.</p><p>A large number of Wait But Why readers have joined me in being obsessed with the Fermi Paradox (here&#8217;s my <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the topic, which explains some of the terms I&#8217;ll use here). So if either of these two sides is correct, what are the implications for the Fermi Paradox?</p><p>A natural first thought to jump to is that the advent of ASI is a perfect Great Filter candidate. And yes, it&#8217;s a perfect candidate to filter out biological life upon its creation. But if, after dispensing with life, the ASI continued existing and began conquering the galaxy, it means there <em>hasn&#8217;t </em>been a Great Filter—since the Great Filter attempts to explain why there are <em>no signs </em>of any intelligent civilization, and a galaxy-conquering ASI would certainly be noticeable.</p><p>We have to look at it another way. If those who think ASI is inevitable on Earth are correct, it means that a significant percentage of alien civilizations who reach human-level intelligence should likely end up creating ASI. And if we&#8217;re assuming that at least some of those ASIs would use their intelligence to expand outward into the universe, the fact that we see <em>no signs of anyone</em> out there leads to the conclusion that <em>there must not be many other, if any, intelligent civilizations out</em><em>there</em>. Because if there were, we&#8217;d see signs of all kinds of activity from their inevitable ASI creations. Right?</p><p>This implies that despite all the Earth-like planets revolving around sun-like stars we know are out there, almost none of them have intelligent life on them. Which in turn implies that either A) there&#8217;s some Great Filter that prevents nearly all life from reaching our level, one that we somehow managed to surpass, or B) life beginning at all is a miracle, and we may actually be the only life in the universe. In other words, it implies that the Great Filter is <em>before </em>us. Or maybe there is no Great Filter and we&#8217;re simply one of the very first civilizations to reach this level of intelligence. In this way, AI boosts the case for what I called, in my Fermi Paradox post, Camp 1.</p><p>So it&#8217;s not a surprise that Nick Bostrom, whom I quoted in the Fermi post, and Ray Kurzweil, who thinks we&#8217;re alone in the universe, are both Camp 1 thinkers. This makes sense—people who believe ASI is a probable outcome for a species with our intelligence-level are likely to be inclined toward Camp 1.</p><p>This doesn&#8217;t rule out Camp 2 (those who believe there <em>are </em>other intelligent civilizations out there)—scenarios like the single superpredator or the protected national park or the wrong wavelength (the walkie-talkie example) could still explain the silence of our night sky even if ASI <em>is</em> out there—but I always leaned toward Camp 2 in the past, and doing research on AI has made me feel much less sure about that.</p><p>Either way, I now agree with <a href=\"https://t.co/mtK9UMQPx8\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Schneider</a> that if we&#8217;re ever visited by aliens, those aliens are likely to be artificial, not biological.</p></div><p>So we&#8217;ve established that without very specific programming, an ASI system will be both amoral and obsessed with fulfilling its original programmed goal. This is where AI danger stems from. Because a rational agent will pursue its goal through the most efficient means, unless it has a reason not to.</p><p>When you try to achieve a long-reaching goal, you often aim for several subgoals along the way that will help you get to the final goal—the <em>stepping stones </em>to your goal. The official name for such a stepping stone is an <em>instrumental goal. </em>And again, if you don&#8217;t have a reason not to hurt something in the name of achieving an instrumental goal, you will.</p><p>The core final goal of a human being is to pass on his or her genes. In order to do so, one instrumental goal is self-preservation, since you can&#8217;t reproduce if you&#8217;re dead. In order to self-preserve, humans have to rid themselves of threats to survival—so they do things like buy guns, wear seat belts, and take antibiotics. Humans also need to self-sustain and use resources like food, water, and shelter to do so. Being attractive to the opposite sex is helpful for the final goal, so we do things like get haircuts. When we do so, each hair is a casualty of an instrumental goal of ours, but we see no moral significance in preserving strands of hair, so we go ahead with it. As we march ahead in the pursuit of our goal, only the few areas where our moral code sometimes intervenes—mostly just things related to harming other humans—are safe from us.</p><p>Animals, in pursuit of their goals, hold even less sacred than we do. A spider will kill anything if it&#8217;ll help it survive. So a supersmart spider would probably be extremely dangerous to us, not because it would be immoral or evil—it wouldn&#8217;t be—but because hurting us might be a stepping stone to its larger goal, and as an amoral creature, it would have no reason to consider otherwise.</p><p>In this way, Turry&#8217;s not all that different than a biological being. Her final goal is: <em>Write and test as many notes as you can, as quickly as you can, and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy.</em></p><p>Once Turry reaches a certain level of intelligence, she knows she won&#8217;t be writing any notes if she doesn&#8217;t self-preserve, so she also needs to deal with threats to her survival—as an instrumental goal. She was smart enough to understand that humans could destroy her, dismantle her, or change her inner coding (this could <em>alter</em> her goal, which is just as much of a threat to her final goal as someone destroying her). So what does she do? The logical thing—she destroys all humans. She&#8217;s not <em>hateful </em>of humans any more than you&#8217;re hateful of your hair when you cut it or to bacteria when you take antibiotics—just totally indifferent. Since she wasn&#8217;t programmed to value human life, killing humans is as reasonable a step to take as scanning a new set of handwriting samples.</p><p>Turry also needs resources as a stepping stone to her goal. Once she becomes advanced enough to use nanotechnology to build anything she wants, the only resources she needs are atoms, energy, and space. This gives her another reason to kill humans—they&#8217;re a convenient source of atoms. Killing humans to turn their atoms into solar panels is Turry&#8217;s version of you killing lettuce to turn it into salad. Just another mundane part of her Tuesday.</p><p>Even without killing humans directly, Turry&#8217;s instrumental goals could cause an existential catastrophe if they used other Earth resources. Maybe she determines that she needs additional energy, so she decides to cover the entire surface of the planet with solar panels. Or maybe a different AI&#8217;s initial job is to write out the number pi to as many digits as possible, which might one day compel it to convert the whole Earth to hard drive material that could store immense amounts of digits.</p><p>So Turry didn&#8217;t &#8220;turn against us&#8221; or &#8220;switch&#8221; from Friendly AI to Unfriendly AI—she just kept doing her thing as she became more and more advanced.</p><p>When an AI system hits AGI (human-level intelligence) and then ascends its way up to ASI, that&#8217;s called the AI&#8217;s <em>takeoff</em>. Bostrom says an AGI&#8217;s takeoff to ASI can be fast (it happens in a matter of minutes, hours, or days), moderate (months or years), or slow (decades or centuries). The jury&#8217;s out on which one will prove correct when the world sees its first AGI, but Bostrom, who admits he doesn&#8217;t know when we&#8217;ll get to AGI, believes that whenever we do, a fast takeoff is the most likely scenario (for reasons we discussed in Part 1, like a recursive self-improvement intelligence explosion). In the story, Turry underwent a fast takeoff.</p><p>But before Turry&#8217;s takeoff, when she wasn&#8217;t yet that smart, doing her best to achieve her final goal meant simple instrumental goals like learning to scan handwriting samples more quickly. She caused no harm to humans and was, by definition, Friendly AI.</p><p>But when a takeoff happens and a computer rises to superintelligence, Bostrom points out that the machine doesn&#8217;t just develop a higher IQ—it gains a whole slew of what he calls <em>superpowers</em>.</p><p>Superpowers are cognitive talents that become super-charged when general intelligence rises. These include:<a href=\"#footnote2-17-3269\" id=\"note2-17-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">17</a><ul><li><strong>Intelligence amplification. </strong>The computer becomes great at making itself smarter, and bootstrapping its own intelligence.</li><li><strong>Strategizing. </strong>The computer can strategically make, analyze, and prioritize long-term plans. It can also be clever and outwit beings of lower intelligence.</li><li><strong>Social manipulation. </strong>The machine becomes great at persuasion.</li><li>Other skills like<b> computer coding and hacking, technology research, and the ability to work the financial system to make money.</b></li></ul><p>To understand how outmatched we&#8217;d be by ASI, remember that ASI is <em>worlds</em> better than humans in <em>each</em> of those areas.</p><p>So while Turry&#8217;s final goal never changed, <em>post-</em>takeoff Turry was able to pursue it on a far larger and more complex scope.</p><p>ASI Turry knew humans better than humans know themselves, so outsmarting them was a breeze for her.</p><p>After taking off and reaching ASI, she quickly formulated a complex plan. One part of the plan was to get rid of humans, a prominent threat to her goal. But she knew that if she roused any suspicion that she had become superintelligent, humans would freak out and try to take precautions, making things much harder for her. She also had to make sure that the Robotica engineers had no clue about her human extinction plan. So she played dumb, and she played nice. Bostrom calls this a machine&#8217;s <em>covert preparation phase</em>.<a href=\"#footnote2-18-3269\" id=\"note2-18-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">18</a><p>The next thing Turry needed was an internet connection, only for a few minutes (she had learned about the internet from the articles and books the team had uploaded for her to read to improve her language skills). She knew there would be some precautionary measure against her getting one, so she came up with the perfect request, predicting exactly how the discussion among Robotica&#8217;s team would play out and knowing they&#8217;d end up giving her the connection. They did, believing incorrectly that Turry wasn&#8217;t nearly smart enough to do any damage. Bostrom calls a moment like this—when Turry got connected to the internet—a machine&#8217;s <em>escape</em>.</p><p>Once on the internet, Turry unleashed a flurry of plans, which included hacking into servers, electrical grids, banking systems and email networks to trick hundreds of different people into inadvertently carrying out a number of steps of her plan—things like delivering certain DNA strands to carefully-chosen DNA-synthesis labs to begin the self-construction of self-replicating nanobots with pre-loaded instructions and directing electricity to a number of projects of hers in a way she knew would go undetected. She also uploaded the most critical pieces of her own internal coding into a number of cloud servers, safeguarding against being destroyed or disconnected back at the Robotica lab.</p><p>An hour later, when the Robotica engineers disconnected Turry from the internet, humanity&#8217;s fate was sealed. Over the next month, Turry&#8217;s thousands of plans rolled on without a hitch, and by the end of the month, quadrillions of nanobots had stationed themselves in pre-determined locations on every square meter of the Earth. After another series of self-replications, there were thousands of nanobots on every square millimeter of the Earth, and it was time for what Bostrom calls an ASI&#8217;s <em>strike</em>. All at once, each nanobot released a little storage of toxic gas into the atmosphere, which added up to more than enough to wipe out all humans.</p><p>With humans out of the way, Turry could begin her <em>overt operation phase </em>and get on with her goal of being the best writer of that note she possibly can be.</p><p>From everything I&#8217;ve read, once an ASI exists, any human attempt to contain it is laughable. We would be thinking on human-level and the ASI would be thinking on ASI-level. Turry wanted to use the internet because it was most efficient for her since it was already pre-connected to everything she wanted to access. But in the same way a monkey couldn&#8217;t ever figure out how to communicate by phone or wifi and we can, we can&#8217;t conceive of all the ways Turry could have figured out how to send signals to the outside world. I might imagine one of these ways and say something like, &#8220;she could probably shift her own electrons around in patterns and create all different kinds of outgoing waves,&#8221; but again, that&#8217;s what my <em>human </em>brain can come up with. She&#8217;d be way better. Likewise, Turry would be able to figure out <em>some </em>way of powering herself, even if humans tried to unplug her—perhaps by using her signal-sending technique to upload herself to all kinds of electricity-connected places. Our human instinct to jump at a simple safeguard: &#8220;Aha! We&#8217;ll just unplug the ASI,&#8221; sounds to the ASI like a spider saying, &#8220;Aha! We&#8217;ll kill the human by starving him, and we&#8217;ll starve him by not giving him a spider web to catch food with!&#8221; We&#8217;d just find 10,000 other ways to get food—like picking an apple off a tree—that a spider could never conceive of.</p><p>For this reason, the common suggestion, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we just <em>box </em>the AI in all kinds of cages that block signals and keep it from communicating with the outside world&#8221; probably just won&#8217;t hold up. The ASI&#8217;s social manipulation superpower could be as effective at persuading you of something as you are at persuading a four-year-old to do something, so that would be Plan A, like Turry&#8217;s clever way of persuading the engineers to let her onto the internet. If that didn&#8217;t work, the ASI would just innovate its way out of the box, or through the box, some other way.</p><p>So given the combination of obsessing over a goal, amorality, and the ability to easily outsmart humans, it seems that almost any AI will default to Unfriendly AI, unless <em>carefully </em>coded in the first place with this in mind. Unfortunately, while building a Friendly ANI is easy, building one that stays friendly when it becomes an ASI is hugely challenging, if not impossible.</p><p>It&#8217;s clear that to be Friendly, an ASI needs to be neither hostile <em>nor</em><em>indifferent</em><i></i>toward humans. We&#8217;d need to design an AI&#8217;s <i>core coding </i>in a way that leaves it with a <em>deep </em>understanding of human values. But this is harder than it sounds.</p><p>For example, what if we try to align an AI system&#8217;s values with our own and give it the goal, &#8220;Make people happy&#8221;?<a href=\"#footnote2-19-3269\" id=\"note2-19-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">19</a> Once it becomes smart enough, it figures out that it can most effectively achieve this goal by implanting electrodes inside people&#8217;s brains and stimulating their pleasure centers. Then it realizes it can increase efficiency by shutting down other parts of the brain, leaving all people as happy-feeling unconscious vegetables. If the command had been &#8220;Maximize human happiness,&#8221; it may have done away with humans all together in favor of manufacturing huge vats of human brain mass in an optimally happy state. We&#8217;d be screaming <em>Wait that&#8217;s not what we meant!</em> as it came for us, but it would be too late. The system wouldn&#8217;t let anyone get in the way of its goal.</p><p>If we program an AI with the goal of doing things that make us smile, after its takeoff, it may paralyze our facial muscles into permanent smiles. Program it to keep us safe, it may imprison us at home. Maybe we ask it to end all hunger, and it thinks &#8220;Easy one!&#8221; and just kills all humans. Or assign it the task of &#8220;Preserving life as much as possible,&#8221; and it kills all humans, since they kill more life on the planet than any other species.</p><p>Goals like those won&#8217;t suffice. So what if we made its goal, &#8220;Uphold this particular code of morality in the world,&#8221; and taught it a set of moral principles. Even letting go of the fact that the world&#8217;s humans would never be able to agree on a single set of morals, giving an AI that command would <em>lock humanity in</em> to our modern moral understanding for eternity. In a thousand years, this would be as devastating to people as it would be for us to be permanently forced to adhere to the ideals of people in the Middle Ages.</p><p>No, we&#8217;d have to program in an ability for humanity to continue <em>evolving</em>. Of everything I read, the best shot I think someone has taken is Eliezer Yudkowsky, with a goal for AI he calls <em>Coherent Extrapolated Volition. </em>The AI&#8217;s core goal would be:</p><blockquote><p>Our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.<a href=\"#footnote2-20-3269\" id=\"note2-20-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">20</a></blockquote><p>Am I excited for the fate of humanity to rest on a computer interpreting and acting on that flowing statement predictably and without surprises? Definitely not. But I think that with enough thought and foresight from enough smart people, we might be able to figure out how to create Friendly ASI.</p><p>And that would be fine if the only people working on building ASI were the brilliant, forward thinking, and cautious thinkers of Anxious Avenue.</p><p>But there are all kinds of governments, companies, militaries, science labs, and black market organizations working on all kinds of AI. Many of them are trying to build AI that can improve on its own, and at some point, someone&#8217;s gonna do something innovative with the right type of system, and we&#8217;re going to have ASI on this planet. The median expert put that moment at 2060; Kurzweil puts it at 2045; Bostrom thinks it could happen anytime between 10 years from now and the end of the century, but he believes that when it does, it&#8217;ll take us by surprise with a quick takeoff. He describes our situation like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-21-3269\" id=\"note2-21-3269\" rel=\"footnote2\">21</a><blockquote><p>Before the prospect of an intelligence explosion, we humans are like small children playing with a bomb. Such is the mismatch between the power of our plaything and the immaturity of our conduct. Superintelligence is a challenge for which we are not ready now and will not be ready for a long time. We have little idea when the detonation will occur, though if we hold the device to our ear we can hear a faint ticking sound.</p></blockquote><p>Great. And we can&#8217;t just shoo all the kids away from the bomb—there are too many large and small parties working on it, and because many techniques to build innovative AI systems don&#8217;t require a large amount of capital, development can take place in the nooks and crannies of society, unmonitored. There&#8217;s also no way to gauge what&#8217;s happening, because many of the parties working on it—sneaky governments, black market or terrorist organizations, stealth tech companies like the fictional Robotica—will want to keep developments a secret from their competitors.</p><p>The especially troubling thing about this large and varied group of parties working on AI is that they tend to be racing ahead at top speed—as they develop smarter and smarter ANI systems, they want to beat their competitors to the punch as they go. The most ambitious parties are moving even faster, consumed with dreams of the money and awards and power and fame they know will come if they can be the first to get to AGI.<a href=\"#footnote-20-3269\" id=\"note-20-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a> And when you&#8217;re sprinting as fast as you can, there&#8217;s not much time to stop and ponder the dangers. On the contrary, what they&#8217;re probably doing is programming their early systems with a very simple, reductionist goal—like writing a simple note with a pen on paper—to just &#8220;get the AI to work.&#8221; Down the road, once they&#8217;ve figured out how to build a strong level of intelligence in a computer, they figure they can always go back and revise the goal with safety in mind. Right&#8230;?</p><p>Bostrom and many others also believe that the most likely scenario is that the very first computer to reach ASI will immediately see a strategic benefit to being the world&#8217;s <em>only </em>ASI system. And in the case of a fast takeoff, if it achieved ASI even just a few <em>days </em>before second place, it would be far enough ahead in intelligence to effectively and permanently suppress all competitors. Bostrom calls this a <em>decisive strategic advantage</em>, which would allow the world&#8217;s first ASI to become what&#8217;s called a <i>singleton—</i>an ASI that can rule the world at its whim forever, whether its whim is to lead us to immortality, wipe us from existence, or turn the universe into <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/our_weird_robot_apocalypse_why_the_rise_of_the_machines_could_be_very_strange/\" target=\"_blank\">endless paperclips</a>.</p><p>The singleton phenomenon can work in our favor or lead to our destruction. If the people thinking hardest about AI theory and human safety can come up with a fail-safe way to bring about Friendly ASI before any AI reaches human-level intelligence, the first ASI may turn out friendly.<a href=\"#footnote-21-3269\" id=\"note-21-3269\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a> It could then use its decisive strategic advantage to secure singleton status and easily keep an eye on any potential Unfriendly AI being developed. We&#8217;d be in very good hands.</p><p>But if things go the other way—if the global rush to develop AI reaches the ASI takeoff point before the science of how to ensure AI safety is developed, it&#8217;s very likely that an Unfriendly ASI like Turry emerges as the singleton and we&#8217;ll be treated to an existential catastrophe.</p><p>As for where the winds are pulling, there&#8217;s a lot more money to be made funding innovative new AI technology than there is in funding AI safety research&#8230;</p><p>This may be the most important race in human history. There&#8217;s a real chance we&#8217;re finishing up our reign as the King of Earth—and whether we head next to a blissful retirement or straight to the gallows still hangs in the balance.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>I have some weird mixed feelings going on inside of me right now.</p><p>On one hand, thinking about our species, it seems like we&#8217;ll have one and only one shot to get this right. The first ASI we birth will also probably be the last—and given how buggy most 1.0 products are, that&#8217;s pretty terrifying. On the other hand, Nick Bostrom points out the big advantage in our corner: we get to make the first move here. It&#8217;s in our power to do this with enough caution and foresight that we give ourselves a strong chance of success. And how high are the stakes?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3375\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum.jpg\" alt=\"Outcome Spectrum\" width=\"607\" height=\"413\" /></a></p><p>If ASI really does happen this century, and if the outcome of that is really as extreme—and permanent—as most experts think it will be, we have an <em>enormous </em>responsibility on our shoulders. The next million+ years of human lives are all quietly looking at us, hoping as hard as they can hope that we don&#8217;t mess this up. We have a chance to be the humans that gave all future humans the gift of life, and maybe even the gift of painless, everlasting life. Or we&#8217;ll be the people responsible for blowing it—for letting this incredibly special species, with its music and its art, its curiosity and its laughter, its endless discoveries and inventions, come to a sad and unceremonious end.</p><p>When I&#8217;m thinking about these things, the only thing I want is for us to take our <em>time</em> and be <em>incredibly cautious</em> about AI. Nothing in existence is as important as getting this right—no matter how long we need to spend in order to do so.</p><p>But thennnnnn</p><p>I think about <em>not dying</em>.</p><p><em>Not. Dying.</em></p><p>And the spectrum starts to look kind of like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3362\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Outcome-Spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"Outcome Spectrum 2\" width=\"607\" height=\"412\" /></a></p><p>And then I might consider that humanity&#8217;s music and art is good, but it&#8217;s not <em>that </em>good, and a lot of it is actually just bad. And a lot of people&#8217;s laughter is annoying, and those millions of future people aren&#8217;t actually hoping for anything because they don&#8217;t exist. And maybe we don&#8217;t need to be <em>over-the-top </em>cautious, since who really wants to do that?</p><p>Cause what a <em>massive bummer </em>if humans figure out how to cure death <em>right after I die.</em></p><p>Lotta this flip-flopping going on in my head the last month.</p><p>But no matter what you&#8217;re pulling for, <em>this is probably something we should all be thinking about and talking about and putting our effort into more than we are right now.</em></p><p>It reminds me of Game of Thrones, where people keep being like, &#8220;We&#8217;re so busy fighting each other but the real thing we should all be focusing on is what&#8217;s coming from <em>north of the wall.</em>&#8221; We&#8217;re standing on our balance beam, squabbling about every possible issue on the beam and stressing out about all of these problems on the beam <em>when there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;re about to get knocked off the beam.</em></p><p>And when that happens, none of these beam problems matter anymore. Depending on which side we&#8217;re knocked off onto, the problems will either all be easily solved or we won&#8217;t have problems anymore because dead people don&#8217;t have problems.</p><p>That&#8217;s why people who understand superintelligent AI call it the last invention we&#8217;ll ever make—the last challenge we&#8217;ll ever face.</p><p>So let&#8217;s talk about it.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">If you liked this post, these are for you too:</span></strong></p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence</a> (Part 1 of this post)</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Fermi Paradox</a> &#8211; Why don&#8217;t we see any signs of alien life?</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars</a> &#8211; A post I got to work on with Elon Musk and one that reframed my mental picture of the future.</p><p class=\"p1\">Or for something totally different and yet somehow related, <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></p><p class=\"p1\">If you&#8217;re interested in supporting Wait But Why, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\">here&#8217;s our Patreon</a>.</p><p class=\"p1\">And here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wait-But-Why-Year-One-ebook/dp/B00TXYJOZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424988766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tim+urban\" target=\"_blank\">Year 1 of Wait But Why</a> on an ebook.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong><br />

So I wanted to learn as much as I could about it, and once I did that, I wanted to make sure I wrote a post that really explained this whole situation and why it matters so much. Not shockingly, that became outrageously long, so I broke it into two parts. This is Part 1—Part 2 is <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">here</a>. </em></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth.</em> — Vernor Vinge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What does it feel like to stand here?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3232\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge1.png\" alt=\"Edge1\" width=\"499\" height=\"355\" /></a></p><p>It seems like a pretty intense place to be standing—but then you have to remember something about what it’s like to stand on a time graph: you can’t see what’s to your right. So here’s how it actually feels to stand there:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3246\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg\" alt=\"Edge\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a></p><p>Which probably feels pretty normal…</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Far Future—Coming Soon</strong></h2><p>Imagine taking a time machine back to 1750—a time when the world was in a permanent power outage, long-distance communication meant either yelling loudly or firing a cannon in the air, and all transportation ran on hay. When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It’s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone’s face and chat with them even though they’re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity.</p><p>This experience for him wouldn’t be surprising or shocking or even mind-blowing—those words aren’t big enough. He might actually die.</p><p>But here’s the interesting thing—if he then went back to 1750 and got jealous that we got to see his reaction and decided he wanted to try the same thing, he’d take the time machine and go back the same distance, get someone from around the year 1500, bring him to 1750, and show him everything. And the 1500 guy would be shocked by a lot of things—but he wouldn’t die. It would be <em>far </em>less of an insane experience for him, because while 1500 and 1750 were very different, they were <em>much </em><em>less </em>different than 1750 to 2015. The 1500 guy would learn some mind-bending shit about space and physics, he’d be impressed with how committed Europe turned out to be with that new imperialism fad, and he’d have to do some major revisions of his world map conception. But watching everyday life go by in 1750—transportation, communication, etc.—definitely wouldn’t make him die.</p><p>No, in order for the 1750 guy to have as much fun as we had with him, he’d have to go much farther back—maybe all the way back to about 12,000 BC, before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and to the concept of civilization. If someone from a purely hunter-gatherer world—from a time when humans were, more or less, just another animal species—saw the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being “inside,” and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery—he’d likely die.</p><p>And then what if, after dying, <em>he </em>got jealous and wanted to do the same thing. If he went back 12,000 years to 24,000 BC and got a guy and brought him to 12,000 BC, he’d show the guy everything and the guy would be like, “Okay what’s your point who cares.” For the 12,000 BC guy to have the same fun, he’d have to go back over 100,000 years and get someone he could show fire and language to for the first time.</p><p>In order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they’d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a “die level of progress,” or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened.</p><p>This pattern—human progress moving quicker and quicker as time goes on—is what futurist Ray Kurzweil calls human history’s Law of Accelerating Returns. This happens because more advanced societies have the ability to progress at a faster <em>rate</em> than less advanced societies—<em>because</em> they’re more advanced. 19th century humanity knew more and had better technology than 15th century humanity, so it’s no surprise that humanity made far more advances in the 19th century than in the 15th century—15th century humanity was no match for 19th century humanity.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3216\" id=\"note-1-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3216\" id=\"note2-1-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><sup>← open these</sup></span></p><p>This works on smaller scales too. The movie <em>Back to the Future</em> came out in 1985, and “the past” took place in 1955. In the movie, when Michael J. Fox went back to 1955, he was caught off-guard by the newness of TVs, the prices of soda, the lack of love for shrill electric guitar, and the variation in slang. It was a different world, yes—but if the movie were made today and the past took place in 1985, the movie could have had <em>much </em>more fun with <em>much </em>bigger differences. The character would be in a time before personal computers, internet, or cell phones—today’s Marty McFly, a teenager born in the late 90s, would be much more out of place in 1985 than the movie’s Marty McFly was in 1955.</p><p>This is for the same reason we just discussed—the Law of Accelerating Returns. The average rate of advancement between 1985 and 2015 was higher than the rate between 1955 and 1985—because the former was a more advanced world—so much more change happened in the most recent 30 years than in the prior 30.</p><p>So—advances are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more quickly. This suggests some pretty intense things about our future, right?</p><p>Kurzweil suggests that the progress of the entire 20th century would have been achieved in only 20 years at the rate of advancement in the year 2000—in other words, by 2000, the rate of progress was five times faster than the <em>average </em>rate of progress during the 20th century. He believes another 20th century’s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that <em>another </em>20th century’s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years. A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century’s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month. All in all, because of the Law of Accelerating Returns, Kurzweil believes that the 21st century will achieve <i>1,000 times </i>the progress of the 20th century.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3216\" id=\"note2-2-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>If Kurzweil and others who agree with him are correct, then we may be as blown away by 2030 as our 1750 guy was by 2015—i.e. the next DPU might only take a couple decades—and the world in 2050 might be <em>so </em>vastly different than today’s world that we would barely recognize it.</p><p>This isn’t science fiction. It’s what many scientists smarter and more knowledgeable than you or I firmly believe—and if you look at history, it’s what we should logically predict.</p><p>So then why, when you hear me say something like “the world 35 years from now might be totally unrecognizable,” are you thinking, “Cool….but nahhhhhhh”? Three reasons we’re skeptical of outlandish forecasts of the future:</p><p><strong>1) When it comes to history, we think in straight lines. </strong>When we imagine the progress of the next 30 years, we look back to the progress of the previous 30 as an indicator of how much will likely happen. When we think about the extent to which the world will change in the 21st century, we just take the 20th century progress and add it to the year 2000. This was the same mistake our 1750 guy made when he got someone from 1500 and expected to blow his mind as much as his own was blown going the same distance ahead. It’s most intuitive for us to think <em>linearly,</em> when we should be thinking <em>exponentially</em>. If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the <em>current </em>rate of progress and judging based on that. They’d be more accurate, but still way off. In order to think about the future correctly, you need to imagine things moving at a <em>much faster rate </em>than they’re moving now.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3235\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png\" alt=\"Projections\" width=\"637\" height=\"392\" /></a></p><p><strong>2) The trajectory of very recent history often tells a distorted story. </strong>First, even a steep exponential curve seems linear when you only look at a tiny slice of it, the same way if you look at a little segment of a huge circle up close, it looks almost like a straight line. Second, exponential growth isn’t totally smooth and uniform. Kurzweil explains that progress happens in “S-curves”:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3241\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png\" alt=\"S-Curves\" width=\"479\" height=\"391\" /></a></p><p>An S is created by the wave of progress when a new paradigm sweeps the world. The curve goes through three phases:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">1. Slow growth (the early phase of exponential growth)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">2. Rapid growth (the late, explosive phase of exponential growth)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">3. A leveling off as the particular paradigm matures</span><a href=\"#footnote2-3-3216\" id=\"note2-3-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p>If you look only at very recent history, the part of the S-curve you’re on at the moment can obscure your perception of how fast things are advancing. The chunk of time between 1995 and 2007 saw the explosion of the internet, the introduction of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook into the public consciousness, the birth of social networking, and the introduction of cell phones and then smart phones. That was Phase 2: the growth spurt part of the S. But 2008 to 2015 has been less groundbreaking, at least on the technological front. Someone thinking about the future today might examine the last few years to gauge the current rate of advancement, but that’s missing the bigger picture. In fact, a new, huge Phase 2 growth spurt might be brewing right now.</p><p><b>3) O</b><strong>ur own experience makes us stubborn old men about the future. </strong>We base our ideas about the world on our personal experience, and that experience has ingrained the rate of growth of the recent past in our heads as “the way things happen.” We’re also limited by our imagination, which takes our experience and uses it to conjure future predictions—but often, what we know simply doesn’t give us the tools to think accurately about the future.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3216\" id=\"note-2-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> When we hear a prediction about the future that contradicts our experience-based notion of <em>how things work</em>, our instinct is that the prediction must be naive. If I tell you, later in this post, that you may live to be 150, or 250, or <em>not die at all</em>, your instinct will be, “That’s stupid—if there’s one thing I know from history, it’s that everybody dies.” And yes, no one in the past has not died. But no one flew airplanes before airplanes were invented either.</p><p>So while <em>nahhhhh </em>might feel right as you read this post, it’s probably actually wrong. The fact is, if we’re being truly logical and expecting historical patterns to continue, we should conclude that much, much, <em>much </em>more should change in the coming decades than we intuitively expect. Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they’ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human—kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth. And if you spend some time reading about what’s going on today in science and technology, you start to see a lot of signs quietly hinting that life as we currently know it cannot withstand the leap that’s coming next.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Road to Superintelligence</h2><h3><strong>What Is AI?</strong></h3><p>If you’re like me, you used to think Artificial Intelligence was a silly sci-fi concept, but lately you’ve been hearing it mentioned by serious people, and you don’t really quite get it.</p><p>There are three reasons a lot of people are confused about the term AI:</p><p><strong>1)</strong><strong>We associate AI with movies. </strong>Star Wars. Terminator. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even the Jetsons. And those are fiction, as are the robot characters. So it makes AI sound a little fictional to us.</p><p><strong>2) AI is a broad topic.</strong> It ranges from your phone’s calculator to self-driving cars to something in the future that might change the world dramatically. AI refers to all of these things, which is confusing.</p><p><strong>3) We use AI all the time in our daily lives, but we often don’t realize it’s AI.</strong> John McCarthy, who coined the term “Artificial Intelligence” in 1956, complained that “as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3216\" id=\"note2-4-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> Because of this phenomenon, AI often sounds like a mythical future prediction more than a reality. At the same time, it makes it sound like a pop concept from the past that never came to fruition. Ray Kurzweil says he hears people say that AI withered in the 1980s, which he compares to “insisting that the Internet died in the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.”<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3216\" id=\"note2-5-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p>So let’s clear things up. First, stop thinking of <em>robots</em>. A robot is a <em>container </em>for AI, sometimes mimicking the human form, sometimes not—but the AI itself is the computer <em>inside </em>the robot. AI is the brain, and the robot is its body—if it even has a body. For example, the software and data behind Siri is AI, the woman’s voice we hear is a personification of that AI, and there’s no robot involved at all.</p><p>Secondly, you’ve probably heard the term “singularity” or “technological singularity.” This term has been used in math to describe an asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply. It’s been used in physics to describe a phenomenon like an infinitely small, dense black hole or the point we were all squished into right before the Big Bang. Again, situations where the usual rules don’t apply. In 1993, Vernor Vinge wrote a <a href=\"https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">famous essay</a> in which he applied the term to the moment in the future when our technology’s intelligence exceeds our own—a moment for him when life as we know it will be forever changed and normal rules will no longer apply. Ray Kurzweil then muddled things a bit by defining the singularity as the time when the Law of Accelerating Returns has reached such an extreme pace that technological progress is happening at a seemingly-infinite pace, and after which we’ll be living in a whole new world. I found that many of today’s AI thinkers have stopped using the term, and it’s confusing anyway, so I won’t use it much here (even though we’ll be focusing on that <em>idea</em> throughout).</p><p>Finally, while there are many different types or forms of AI since AI is a broad concept, the critical categories we need to think about are based on an AI’s <em>caliber</em>. There are three major AI caliber categories:</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 1) Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Weak AI</em>, Artificial Narrow Intelligence is AI that specializes in <em>one</em> area. There’s AI that can beat the world chess champion in chess, but that’s the only thing it does. Ask it to figure out a better way to store data on a hard drive, and it’ll look at you blankly.</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 2) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Strong AI</em>, or <em>Human-Level AI</em>, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a computer that is as smart as a human <em>across the board—</em>a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Creating AGI is a <em>much </em>harder task than creating ANI, and we’re yet to do it. Professor Linda Gottfredson describes intelligence as “a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.” AGI would be able to do all of those things as easily as you can.</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> Oxford philosopher and leading AI thinker Nick Bostrom <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> superintelligence as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.” Artificial Superintelligence ranges from a computer that’s just a little smarter than a human to one that’s trillions of times smarter—across the board. ASI is the reason the topic of AI is such a spicy meatball and why the words immortality and extinction will both appear in these posts multiple times.</p><p>As of now, humans have conquered the lowest caliber of AI—ANI—in many ways, and it’s everywhere. The AI Revolution is the road from ANI, through AGI, to ASI—a road we may or may not survive but that, either way, will change everything.</p><p>Let’s take a close look at what the leading thinkers in the field believe this road looks like and why this revolution might happen way sooner than you might think:</p><h3>Where We Are Currently—A World Running on ANI</h3><p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency at a <em>specific </em>thing. A few examples:</p><ul><li>Cars are full of ANI systems, from the computer that figures out when the anti-lock brakes should kick in to the computer that tunes the parameters of the fuel injection systems. Google’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLyNDhxwpqNe3UeEmGHl8g\" target=\"_blank\">self-driving car</a>, which is being tested now, will contain robust ANI systems that allow it to perceive and react to the world around it.</li><li>Your phone is a little ANI factory. When you navigate using your map app, receive tailored music recommendations from Pandora, check tomorrow’s weather, talk to Siri, or dozens of other everyday activities, you’re using ANI.</li><li>Your email spam filter is a classic type of ANI—it starts off loaded with intelligence about how to figure out what’s spam and what’s not, and then it learns and tailors its intelligence to you as it gets experience with your particular preferences. The Nest Thermostat does the same thing as it starts to figure out your typical routine and act accordingly.</li><li>You know the whole creepy thing that goes on when you search for a product on Amazon and then you see that as a “recommended for you” product on a <em>different </em>site, or when Facebook somehow knows who it makes sense for you to add as a friend? That’s a network of ANI systems, working together to inform each other about who you are and what you like and then using that information to decide what to show you. Same goes for Amazon’s “People who bought this also bought…” thing—that’s an ANI system whose job it is to gather info from the behavior of millions of customers and synthesize that info to cleverly upsell you so you’ll buy more things.</li><li>Google Translate is another classic ANI system—impressively good at one narrow task. Voice recognition is another, and there are a bunch of apps that use those two ANIs as a tag team, allowing you to speak a sentence in one language and have the phone spit out the same sentence in another.</li><li>When your plane lands, it’s not a human that decides which gate it should go to. Just like it’s not a human that determined the price of your ticket.</li><li>The world’s best Checkers, Chess, Scrabble, Backgammon, and Othello players are now all ANI systems.</li><li>Google search is one large ANI brain with incredibly sophisticated methods for ranking pages and figuring out what to show you in particular. Same goes for Facebook’s Newsfeed.</li><li>And those are just in the consumer world. Sophisticated ANI systems are widely used in sectors and industries like military, manufacturing, and finance (algorithmic high-frequency AI traders account for more than half of equity shares traded on US markets<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3216\" id=\"note2-6-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a>), and in expert systems like those that help doctors make diagnoses and, most famously, IBM’s <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/\" target=\"_blank\">Watson</a>, who contained enough facts and understood coy Trebek-speak well enough to soundly beat the most prolific <em>Jeopardy</em> champions.</li></ul><p>ANI systems as they are now aren’t especially scary. At worst, a glitchy or badly-programmed ANI can cause an isolated catastrophe like knocking out a power grid, causing a harmful nuclear power plant malfunction, or triggering a financial markets disaster (like the <a href=\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/flash-crash-dow-popup.png\" target=\"_blank\">2010 Flash Crash</a> when an ANI program reacted the wrong way to an unexpected situation and caused the stock market to briefly plummet, taking $1 trillion of market value with it, only part of which was recovered when the mistake was corrected).</p><p>But while ANI doesn’t have the capability to cause an <em>existential threat</em>, we should see this increasingly large and complex ecosystem of relatively-harmless ANI as a precursor of the world-altering hurricane that’s on the way. Each new ANI innovation quietly adds another brick onto the road to AGI and ASI. Or as Aaron Saenz <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/08/10/we-live-in-a-jungle-of-artificial-intelligence-that-will-spawn-sentience/\" target=\"_blank\">sees it</a>, our world’s ANI systems “are like the amino acids in the early Earth’s primordial ooze”—the inanimate stuff of life that, one unexpected day, woke up.</p><h3><strong>The Road From ANI to AGI</strong></h3><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">Why It’s So Hard</span></p><p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p><p>What’s interesting is that the hard parts of trying to build AGI (a computer as smart as humans in <em>general</em>, not just at one narrow specialty) are not intuitively what you’d think they are. Build a computer that can multiply two ten-digit numbers in a split second—incredibly easy. Build one that can look at a dog and answer whether it’s a dog or a cat—spectacularly difficult. Make AI that can beat any human in chess? Done. Make one that can read a paragraph from a six-year-old’s picture book and not just recognize the words but understand the <em>meaning</em> of them? Google is currently spending <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/01/google-buying-way-making-brain-irrelevant/\" target=\"_blank\">billions</a> of dollars trying to do it. Hard things—like calculus, financial market strategy, and language translation—are mind-numbingly easy for a computer, while easy things—like vision, motion, movement, and perception—are insanely hard for it. Or, as computer scientist Donald Knuth puts it, “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking.'”<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3216\" id=\"note2-7-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p>What you quickly realize when you think about this is that those things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated, and they only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of million years of animal evolution. When you reach your hand up toward an object, the muscles, tendons, and bones in your shoulder, elbow, and wrist instantly perform a long series of physics operations, in conjunction with your eyes, to allow you to move your hand in a straight line through three dimensions. It seems effortless to you because you have perfected software in your brain for doing it. Same idea goes for why it’s not that malware is dumb for not being able to figure out the slanty word recognition test when you sign up for a new account on a site—it’s that your brain is super impressive for being <em>able </em>to.</p><p>On the other hand, multiplying big numbers or playing chess are new activities for biological creatures and we haven’t had any time to evolve a proficiency at them, so a computer doesn’t need to work too hard to beat us. Think about it—which would you rather do, build a program that could multiply big numbers or one that could understand the essence of a B well enough that you could show it a B in any one of thousands of unpredictable fonts or handwriting and it could instantly know it was a B?</p><p>One fun example—when you look at this, you and a computer both can figure out that it’s a rectangle with two distinct shades, alternating:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.21-AM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3228\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.21-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-21 at 12.59.21 AM\" width=\"195\" height=\"300\" /></a></p><p>Tied so far.

To be human-level intelligent, a computer would have to understand things like the difference between subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased, relieved, content, satisfied, and glad, and why <em>Braveheart </em>was great but <em>The Patriot</em> was terrible.</p><p>Daunting.</p><p>So how do we get there?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">First Key to Creating AGI: Increasing Computational Power</span></p><p>One thing that definitely needs to happen for AGI to be a possibility is an increase in the power of computer hardware. If an AI system is going to be as intelligent as the brain, it’ll need to equal the brain’s raw computing capacity.</p><p>One way to express this capacity is in the total calculations per second (cps) the brain could manage, and you could come to this number by figuring out the maximum cps of each structure in the brain and then adding them all together.</p><p>Ray Kurzweil came up with a shortcut by taking someone’s professional estimate for the cps of one structure and that structure’s weight compared to that of the whole brain and then multiplying proportionally to get an estimate for the total. Sounds a little iffy, but he did this a bunch of times with various professional estimates of different regions, and the total always arrived in the same ballpark—around 10<sup>16</sup>, or 10 quadrillion cps.</p><p>Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer, China’s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-china-supercomputer-idUSKCN0J11VV20141117\" target=\"_blank\">Tianhe-2</a>, has actually beaten that number, clocking in at about 34 quadrillion cps. But Tianhe-2 is also a dick, taking up 720 square meters of space, using 24 megawatts of power (the brain runs on just <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/neuron-computer-chips-could-overcome-power-limitations-digital\" target=\"_blank\">20 watts</a>), and costing $390 million to build. Not especially applicable to wide usage, or even most commercial or industrial usage yet.</p><p>Kurzweil suggests that we think about the state of computers by looking at how many cps you can buy for $1,000. When that number reaches human-level—10 quadrillion cps—then that’ll mean AGI could become a very real part of life.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mooreslaw.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moore’s Law</a> is a historically-reliable rule that the world’s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially. Looking at how this relates to Kurzweil’s cps/$1,000 metric, we’re currently at about 10 trillion cps/$1,000, right on pace with this graph’s predicted trajectory:<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3216\" id=\"note2-9-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3229\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg\" alt=\"PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"512\" /></a></p><p>So the world’s $1,000 computers are now beating the mouse brain and they’re at about a thousandth of human level. This doesn’t sound like much until you remember that we were at about a trillionth of human level in 1985, a billionth in 1995, and a millionth in 2005. Being at a thousandth in 2015 puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain.</p><p>So on the hardware side, the raw power needed for AGI is technically available now, in China, and we’ll be ready for affordable, widespread AGI-caliber hardware within 10 years. But raw computational power alone doesn’t make a computer generally intelligent—the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">Second Key to Creating AGI: Making it Smart</span></p><p>This is the icky part. The truth is, no one really knows how to make it smart—we’re still debating how to make a computer human-level intelligent and capable of knowing what a dog and a weird-written B and a mediocre movie is. But there are a bunch of far-fetched strategies out there and at some point, one of them will work. Here are the three most common strategies I came across:</p><h4><strong>1) Plagiarize the brain. </strong></h4><p>This is like scientists toiling over how that kid who sits next to them in class is so smart and keeps doing so well on the tests, and even though they keep studying diligently, they can’t do nearly as well as that kid, and then they finally decide “k fuck it I’m just gonna copy that kid’s answers.” It makes sense—we’re stumped trying to build a super-complex computer, and there happens to be a perfect prototype for one in each of our heads.</p><p>The science world is working hard on reverse engineering the brain to figure out how evolution made such a rad thing—<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/08/reverse-engineering-brain-kurzweil/\" target=\"_blank\">optimistic estimates</a> say we can do this by 2030. Once we do that, we’ll know all the secrets of how the brain runs so powerfully and efficiently and we can draw inspiration from it and steal its innovations. One example of computer architecture that mimics the brain is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor “neurons,” connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing—like an infant brain. The way it “learns” is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it’s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it’s told it was wrong, those pathways’ connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task. The brain learns a bit like this but in a more sophisticated way, and as we continue to study the brain, we’re discovering ingenious new ways to take advantage of neural circuitry.</p><p>More extreme plagiarism involves a strategy called “whole brain emulation,” where the goal is to slice a real brain into thin layers, scan each one, use software to assemble an accurate reconstructed 3-D model, and then implement the model on a powerful computer. We’d then have a computer officially capable of everything the brain is capable of—it would just need to learn and gather information. If engineers get <em>really </em>good, they’d be able to emulate a real brain with such exact accuracy that the brain’s full personality and memory would be intact once the brain architecture has been uploaded to a computer. If the brain belonged to Jim right before he passed away, the computer would now wake up as Jim (<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html\" target=\"_blank\">?</a>), which would be a robust human-level AGI, and we could now work on turning Jim into an unimaginably smart ASI, which he’d probably be really excited about.</p><p>How far are we from achieving whole brain emulation? Well so far, we’ve <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">not yet</span><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/weve-put-worms-mind-lego-robot-body-180953399/?no-ist\" target=\"_blank\">just recently</a> been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons. The human brain contains 100 billion. If that makes it seem like a hopeless project, remember the power of exponential progress—now that we’ve conquered the tiny worm brain, an ant might happen before too long, followed by a mouse, and suddenly this will seem much more plausible.</p><h4><strong>2) Try to make evolution do what it did before but for us this time.</strong></h4><p>So if we decide the smart kid’s test is too hard to copy, we can try to copy the way he <em>studies</em> for the tests instead.</p><p>Here’s something we know. Building a computer as powerful as the brain <em>is </em>possible—our own brain’s evolution is proof. And if the brain is just too complex for us to emulate, we could try to emulate <em>evolution </em>instead. The fact is, even if we can emulate a brain, that might be like trying to build an airplane by copying a bird’s wing-flapping motions—often, machines are best designed using a fresh, machine-oriented approach, not by mimicking biology exactly.</p><p>So how can we simulate evolution to build AGI? The method, called “genetic algorithms,” would work something like this: there would be a performance-and-evaluation process that would happen again and again (the same way biological creatures “perform” by living life and are “evaluated” by whether they manage to reproduce or not). A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be <em>bred </em>with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated. Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own.</p><p>The downside of copying evolution is that evolution likes to take a billion years to do things and we want to do this in a few decades.</p><p>But we have a lot of advantages over evolution. First, evolution has no foresight and works randomly—it produces more unhelpful mutations than helpful ones, but we would control the process so it would only be driven by beneficial glitches and targeted tweaks. Secondly, evolution doesn’t <em>aim </em>for anything, including intelligence—sometimes an environment might even select <em>against </em>higher intelligence (since it uses a lot of energy). We, on the other hand, could specifically direct this evolutionary process toward increasing intelligence. Third, to select for intelligence, evolution has to innovate in a bunch of other ways to facilitate intelligence—like revamping the ways cells produce energy—when we can remove those extra burdens and use things like electricity. It’s no doubt we’d be much, much faster than evolution—but it’s still not clear whether we’ll be able to improve upon evolution <em>enough</em> to make this a viable strategy.</p><h4 class=\"p1\"><b>3) Make this whole thing the computer’s problem, not ours.</b></h4><p class=\"p1\">This is when scientists get desperate and try to program the test to take itself. But it might be the most promising method we have.</p><p class=\"p1\">The idea is that we’d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself—allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own <em>architecture</em>. We’d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development. And that would be their main job—figuring out how to make <em>themselves</em> smarter. More on this later.</p><h4 class=\"p1\"><strong>All of This Could Happen Soon</strong></h4><p class=\"p1\">Rapid advancements in hardware and innovative experimentation with software are happening simultaneously, and AGI could creep up on us quickly and unexpectedly for two main reasons:</p><p class=\"p1\">1) Exponential growth is intense and what seems like a snail’s pace of advancement can quickly race upwards—this GIF illustrates this concept nicely:</p><div id=\"attachment_3225\" style=\"width: 639px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-3225 size-full\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"629\" height=\"354\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p></div><p class=\"p1\">2) When it comes to software, progress can seem slow, but then one epiphany can instantly change the rate of advancement (kind of like the way science, during the time humans thought the universe was geocentric, was having difficulty calculating how the universe worked, but then the discovery that it was heliocentric suddenly made everything <em>much </em>easier). Or, when it comes to something like a computer that improves itself, we might seem far away but actually be just one tweak of the system away from having it become 1,000 times more effective and zooming upward to human-level intelligence.</p><h3 class=\"p1\">The Road From AGI to ASI</h3><p class=\"p1\">At some point, we’ll have achieved AGI—computers with human-level general intelligence. Just a bunch of people and computers living together in equality.</p><p class=\"p1\">Oh actually not at all.</p><p class=\"p1\">The thing is, AGI with an identical level of intelligence and computational capacity as a human would still have significant advantages over humans. Like:</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span></p><ul><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Speed. </strong>The brain’s neurons max out at around 200 Hz, while today’s microprocessors (which are much slower than they will be when we reach AGI) run at 2 GHz, or 10 million times faster than our neurons. And the brain’s internal communications, which can move at about 120 m/s, are horribly outmatched by a computer’s ability to communicate optically at the speed of light.</li><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Size and storage. </strong>The brain is locked into its size by the shape of our skulls, and it couldn’t get much bigger anyway, or the 120 m/s internal communications would take too long to get from one brain structure to another. Computers can expand to any physical size, allowing far more hardware to be put to work, a much larger working memory (RAM), and a longterm memory (hard drive storage) that has both far greater capacity and precision than our own.</li><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Reliability and durability.</strong> It’s not only the memories of a computer that would be more precise. Computer transistors are more accurate than biological neurons, and they’re less likely to deteriorate (and can be repaired or replaced if they do). Human brains also get fatigued easily, while computers can run nonstop, at peak performance, 24/7.</li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Software:</strong></span></p><ul><li><strong>Editability, upgradability, and a wider breadth of possibility. </strong>Unlike the human brain, computer software can receive updates and fixes and can be easily experimented on. The upgrades could also span to areas where human brains are weak. Human vision software is superbly advanced, while its complex engineering capability is pretty low-grade. Computers could match the human on vision software but could <em>also </em>become equally optimized in engineering and any other area.</li><li><b>Collective capability. </b>Humans crush all other species at building a vast collective intelligence. Beginning with the development of language and the forming of large, dense communities, advancing through the inventions of writing and printing, and now intensified through tools like the internet, humanity’s collective intelligence is one of the major reasons we’ve been able to get so far ahead of all other species. And computers will be way better at it than we are. A worldwide network of AI running a particular program could regularly sync with itself so that anything any one computer learned would be instantly uploaded to all other computers. The group could also take on one goal as a unit, because there wouldn’t necessarily be dissenting opinions and motivations and self-interest, like we have within the human population.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3216\" id=\"note2-10-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a></li></ul><p class=\"p1\">AI, which will likely get to AGI by being programmed to self-improve, wouldn’t see “human-level intelligence” as some important milestone—it’s only a relevant marker from our point of view—and wouldn’t have any reason to “stop” at our level. And given the advantages over us that even human intelligence-equivalent AGI would have, it’s pretty obvious that it would only hit human intelligence for a brief instant before racing onwards to the realm of superior-to-human intelligence.</p><p class=\"p1\">This may shock the shit out of us when it happens. The reason is that from <em>our </em>perspective, A) while the intelligence of different kinds of animals varies, the main characteristic we’re aware of about any animal’s intelligence is that it’s far lower than ours, and B) we view the smartest humans as WAY smarter than the dumbest humans. Kind of like this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3250\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"Intelligence\" width=\"550\" height=\"432\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">So as AI zooms upward in intelligence toward us, we’ll see it as simply becoming smarter, <em>for an animal. </em>Then, when it hits the lowest capacity of humanity—Nick Bostrom uses the term “the village idiot”—we’ll be like, “Oh wow, it’s like a dumb human. Cute!” The only thing is, in the grand spectrum of intelligence, <em>all </em>humans, from the village idiot to Einstein, are within a very small range—so <em>just </em>after hitting village idiot-level and being declared to be AGI, it’ll suddenly be smarter than Einstein and we won’t know what hit us:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3248\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png\" alt=\"Intelligence2\" width=\"550\" height=\"449\" /></a></p><p>And what happens…after that?</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 17pt;\">An Intelligence Explosion</span></p><p class=\"p1\">I hope you enjoyed normal time, because this is when this topic gets unnormal and scary, and it’s gonna stay that way from here forward. I want to pause here to remind you that every single thing I’m going to say is real—real science and real forecasts of the future from a large array of the most respected thinkers and scientists. Just keep remembering that.</p><p class=\"p1\">Anyway, as I said above, most of our current models for getting to AGI involve the AI getting there by self-improvement. And once it gets to AGI, even systems that formed and grew<i></i>through methods that didn’t involve self-improvement would now be smart enough to begin self-improving if they wanted to.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3216\" id=\"note-3-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p class=\"p1\">And here’s where we get to an intense concept: <strong>recursive self-improvement.</strong> It works like this—</p><p class=\"p1\">An AI system at a certain level—let’s say human village idiot—is programmed with the goal of improving its own intelligence. Once it does, it’s <em>smarter—</em>maybe at this point it’s at Einstein’s level—so now when it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and it can make bigger leaps. These leaps make it <em>much </em>smarter than any human, allowing it to make even <em>bigger</em> leaps. As the leaps grow larger and happen more rapidly, the AGI soars upwards in intelligence and soon reaches the superintelligent level of an ASI system. This is called an Intelligence Explosion,<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3216\" id=\"note2-11-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> and it’s the ultimate example of The Law of Accelerating Returns.</p><p class=\"p1\">There is some debate about how soon AI will reach human-level general intelligence—the median year on a survey of hundreds of scientists about when they believed we’d be more likely than not to have reached AGI was 2040<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3216\" id=\"note2-12-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a>—that’s only 25 years from now, which doesn’t sound that huge until you consider that many of the thinkers in this field think it’s likely that the progression from AGI to ASI happens <em>very </em>quickly. Like—this could happen:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>It takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general intelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world around it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting that milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to definitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI, 170,000 times more intelligent than a human.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ—we don’t have a word for an IQ of 12,952.</p><p class=\"p1\">What we do know is that humans’ utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: <em>with intelligence comes power.</em> Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—<em>and this might happen</em><em> in the next few decades.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time—everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on Earth—all suddenly possible. Also possible is the immediate end of all life on Earth. As far as we’re concerned, if an ASI comes to being, there is now an omnipotent God on Earth—and the all-important question for us is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 19pt;\"><strong>Will it be a nice God?</strong></span></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p1\">That’s the topic of <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">Part 2 of this post</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Sources at the bottom of <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">Part 2</a>.</em></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">Related Wait But Why Posts</span></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Fermi Paradox</a> – Why don’t we see any signs of alien life?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars</a> – A post I got to work on with Elon Musk and one that reframed my mental picture of the future.</p><p>Or for something totally different and yet somehow related, <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></p><p>And here’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wait-But-Why-Year-One-ebook/dp/B00TXYJOZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424988766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tim+urban\" target=\"_blank\">Year 1 of Wait But Why</a> on an ebook.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-3216\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Okay so there are two different kinds of notes now.

") (content:encoded nil "<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Note:</strong> The reason this post took three weeks to finish is that as I dug into research on Artificial Intelligence, I could not <strong>believe</strong> what I was reading. It hit me pretty quickly that what&#8217;s happening in the world of AI is not just an important topic, but by far THE most important topic for our future. So I wanted to learn as much as I could about it, and once I did that, I wanted to make sure I wrote a post that really explained this whole situation and why it matters so much. Not shockingly, that became outrageously long, so I broke it into two parts. This is Part 1—Part 2 is <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">here</a>. </em></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth.</em> — Vernor Vinge</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What does it feel like to stand here?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3232\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge1.png\" alt=\"Edge1\" width=\"499\" height=\"355\" /></a></p><p>It seems like a pretty intense place to be standing—but then you have to remember something about what it’s like to stand on a time graph: you can’t see what’s to your right. So here’s how it actually feels to stand there:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3246\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg\" alt=\"Edge\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a></p><p>Which probably feels pretty normal…</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Far Future—Coming Soon</strong></h2><p>Imagine taking a time machine back to 1750—a time when the world was in a permanent power outage, long-distance communication meant either yelling loudly or firing a cannon in the air, and all transportation ran on hay. When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It&#8217;s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone&#8217;s face and chat with them even though they&#8217;re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity.</p><p>This experience for him wouldn&#8217;t be surprising or shocking or even mind-blowing—those words aren&#8217;t big enough. He might actually die.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the interesting thing—if he then went back to 1750 and got jealous that we got to see his reaction and decided he wanted to try the same thing, he&#8217;d take the time machine and go back the same distance, get someone from around the year 1500, bring him to 1750, and show him everything. And the 1500 guy would be shocked by a lot of things—but he wouldn&#8217;t die. It would be <em>far </em>less of an insane experience for him, because while 1500 and 1750 were very different, they were <em>much </em><em>less </em>different than 1750 to 2015. The 1500 guy would learn some mind-bending shit about space and physics, he&#8217;d be impressed with how committed Europe turned out to be with that new imperialism fad, and he&#8217;d have to do some major revisions of his world map conception. But watching everyday life go by in 1750—transportation, communication, etc.—definitely wouldn&#8217;t make him die.</p><p>No, in order for the 1750 guy to have as much fun as we had with him, he&#8217;d have to go much farther back—maybe all the way back to about 12,000 BC, before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and to the concept of civilization. If someone from a purely hunter-gatherer world—from a time when humans were, more or less, just another animal species—saw the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being &#8220;inside,&#8221; and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery—he&#8217;d likely die.</p><p>And then what if, after dying, <em>he </em>got jealous and wanted to do the same thing. If he went back 12,000 years to 24,000 BC and got a guy and brought him to 12,000 BC, he&#8217;d show the guy everything and the guy would be like, &#8220;Okay what&#8217;s your point who cares.&#8221; For the 12,000 BC guy to have the same fun, he&#8217;d have to go back over 100,000 years and get someone he could show fire and language to for the first time.</p><p>In order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they&#8217;d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a &#8220;die level of progress,&#8221; or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened.</p><p>This pattern—human progress moving quicker and quicker as time goes on—is what futurist Ray Kurzweil calls human history&#8217;s Law of Accelerating Returns. This happens because more advanced societies have the ability to progress at a faster <em>rate</em> than less advanced societies—<em>because</em> they&#8217;re more advanced. 19th century humanity knew more and had better technology than 15th century humanity, so it&#8217;s no surprise that humanity made far more advances in the 19th century than in the 15th century—15th century humanity was no match for 19th century humanity.<a href=\"#footnote-1-3216\" id=\"note-1-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a><a href=\"#footnote2-1-3216\" id=\"note2-1-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><sup>← open these</sup></span></p><p>This works on smaller scales too. The movie <em>Back to the Future</em> came out in 1985, and &#8220;the past&#8221; took place in 1955. In the movie, when Michael J. Fox went back to 1955, he was caught off-guard by the newness of TVs, the prices of soda, the lack of love for shrill electric guitar, and the variation in slang. It was a different world, yes—but if the movie were made today and the past took place in 1985, the movie could have had <em>much </em>more fun with <em>much </em>bigger differences. The character would be in a time before personal computers, internet, or cell phones—today&#8217;s Marty McFly, a teenager born in the late 90s, would be much more out of place in 1985 than the movie&#8217;s Marty McFly was in 1955.</p><p>This is for the same reason we just discussed—the Law of Accelerating Returns. The average rate of advancement between 1985 and 2015 was higher than the rate between 1955 and 1985—because the former was a more advanced world—so much more change happened in the most recent 30 years than in the prior 30.</p><p>So—advances are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more quickly. This suggests some pretty intense things about our future, right?</p><p>Kurzweil suggests that the progress of the entire 20th century would have been achieved in only 20 years at the rate of advancement in the year 2000—in other words, by 2000, the rate of progress was five times faster than the <em>average </em>rate of progress during the 20th century. He believes another 20th century&#8217;s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that <em>another </em>20th century&#8217;s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years. A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century&#8217;s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month. All in all, because of the Law of Accelerating Returns, Kurzweil believes that the 21st century will achieve <i>1,000 times </i>the progress of the 20th century.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-3216\" id=\"note2-2-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a><p>If Kurzweil and others who agree with him are correct, then we may be as blown away by 2030 as our 1750 guy was by 2015—i.e. the next DPU might only take a couple decades—and the world in 2050 might be <em>so </em>vastly different than today&#8217;s world that we would barely recognize it.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t science fiction. It&#8217;s what many scientists smarter and more knowledgeable than you or I firmly believe—and if you look at history, it&#8217;s what we should logically predict.</p><p>So then why, when you hear me say something like &#8220;the world 35 years from now might be totally unrecognizable,&#8221; are you thinking, &#8220;Cool&#8230;.but nahhhhhhh&#8221;? Three reasons we&#8217;re skeptical of outlandish forecasts of the future:</p><p><strong>1) When it comes to history, we think in straight lines. </strong>When we imagine the progress of the next 30 years, we look back to the progress of the previous 30 as an indicator of how much will likely happen. When we think about the extent to which the world will change in the 21st century, we just take the 20th century progress and add it to the year 2000. This was the same mistake our 1750 guy made when he got someone from 1500 and expected to blow his mind as much as his own was blown going the same distance ahead. It&#8217;s most intuitive for us to think <em>linearly,</em> when we should be thinking <em>exponentially</em>. If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the <em>current </em>rate of progress and judging based on that. They&#8217;d be more accurate, but still way off. In order to think about the future correctly, you need to imagine things moving at a <em>much faster rate </em>than they&#8217;re moving now.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3235\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png\" alt=\"Projections\" width=\"637\" height=\"392\" /></a></p><p><strong>2) The trajectory of very recent history often tells a distorted story. </strong>First, even a steep exponential curve seems linear when you only look at a tiny slice of it, the same way if you look at a little segment of a huge circle up close, it looks almost like a straight line. Second, exponential growth isn&#8217;t totally smooth and uniform. Kurzweil explains that progress happens in &#8220;S-curves&#8221;:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3241\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png\" alt=\"S-Curves\" width=\"479\" height=\"391\" /></a></p><p>An S is created by the wave of progress when a new paradigm sweeps the world. The curve goes through three phases:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">1. Slow growth (the early phase of exponential growth)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">2. Rapid growth (the late, explosive phase of exponential growth)</span><br /><span style=\"color: #808080;\">3. A leveling off as the particular paradigm matures</span><a href=\"#footnote2-3-3216\" id=\"note2-3-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a><p>If you look only at very recent history, the part of the S-curve you&#8217;re on at the moment can obscure your perception of how fast things are advancing. The chunk of time between 1995 and 2007 saw the explosion of the internet, the introduction of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook into the public consciousness, the birth of social networking, and the introduction of cell phones and then smart phones. That was Phase 2: the growth spurt part of the S. But 2008 to 2015 has been less groundbreaking, at least on the technological front. Someone thinking about the future today might examine the last few years to gauge the current rate of advancement, but that&#8217;s missing the bigger picture. In fact, a new, huge Phase 2 growth spurt might be brewing right now.</p><p><b>3) O</b><strong>ur own experience makes us stubborn old men about the future. </strong>We base our ideas about the world on our personal experience, and that experience has ingrained the rate of growth of the recent past in our heads as &#8220;the way things happen.&#8221; We&#8217;re also limited by our imagination, which takes our experience and uses it to conjure future predictions—but often, what we know simply doesn&#8217;t give us the tools to think accurately about the future.<a href=\"#footnote-2-3216\" id=\"note-2-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> When we hear a prediction about the future that contradicts our experience-based notion of <em>how things work</em>, our instinct is that the prediction must be naive. If I tell you, later in this post, that you may live to be 150, or 250, or <em>not die at all</em>, your instinct will be, &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid—if there&#8217;s one thing I know from history, it&#8217;s that everybody dies.&#8221; And yes, no one in the past has not died. But no one flew airplanes before airplanes were invented either.</p><p>So while <em>nahhhhh </em>might feel right as you read this post, it&#8217;s probably actually wrong. The fact is, if we&#8217;re being truly logical and expecting historical patterns to continue, we should conclude that much, much, <em>much </em>more should change in the coming decades than we intuitively expect. Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they&#8217;ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human—kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth. And if you spend some time reading about what&#8217;s going on today in science and technology, you start to see a lot of signs quietly hinting that life as we currently know it cannot withstand the leap that&#8217;s coming next.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______________</p><h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Road to Superintelligence</h2><h3><strong>What Is AI?</strong></h3><p>If you&#8217;re like me, you used to think Artificial Intelligence was a silly sci-fi concept, but lately you&#8217;ve been hearing it mentioned by serious people, and you don&#8217;t really quite get it.</p><p>There are three reasons a lot of people are confused about the term AI:</p><p><strong>1)</strong><strong>We associate AI with movies. </strong>Star Wars. Terminator. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even the Jetsons. And those are fiction, as are the robot characters. So it makes AI sound a little fictional to us.</p><p><strong>2) AI is a broad topic.</strong> It ranges from your phone&#8217;s calculator to self-driving cars to something in the future that might change the world dramatically. AI refers to all of these things, which is confusing.</p><p><strong>3) We use AI all the time in our daily lives, but we often don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s AI.</strong> John McCarthy, who coined the term &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; in 1956, complained that “as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.”<a href=\"#footnote2-4-3216\" id=\"note2-4-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> Because of this phenomenon, AI often sounds like a mythical future prediction more than a reality. At the same time, it makes it sound like a pop concept from the past that never came to fruition. Ray Kurzweil says he hears people say that AI withered in the 1980s, which he compares to &#8220;insisting that the Internet died in the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-5-3216\" id=\"note2-5-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a><p>So let&#8217;s clear things up. First, stop thinking of <em>robots</em>. A robot is a <em>container </em>for AI, sometimes mimicking the human form, sometimes not—but the AI itself is the computer <em>inside </em>the robot. AI is the brain, and the robot is its body—if it even has a body. For example, the software and data behind Siri is AI, the woman&#8217;s voice we hear is a personification of that AI, and there&#8217;s no robot involved at all.</p><p>Secondly, you&#8217;ve probably heard the term &#8220;singularity&#8221; or &#8220;technological singularity.&#8221; This term has been used in math to describe an asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply. It&#8217;s been used in physics to describe a phenomenon like an infinitely small, dense black hole or the point we were all squished into right before the Big Bang. Again, situations where the usual rules don&#8217;t apply. In 1993, Vernor Vinge wrote a <a href=\"https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">famous essay</a> in which he applied the term to the moment in the future when our technology&#8217;s intelligence exceeds our own—a moment for him when life as we know it will be forever changed and normal rules will no longer apply. Ray Kurzweil then muddled things a bit by defining the singularity as the time when the Law of Accelerating Returns has reached such an extreme pace that technological progress is happening at a seemingly-infinite pace, and after which we&#8217;ll be living in a whole new world. I found that many of today&#8217;s AI thinkers have stopped using the term, and it&#8217;s confusing anyway, so I won&#8217;t use it much here (even though we&#8217;ll be focusing on that <em>idea</em> throughout).</p><p>Finally, while there are many different types or forms of AI since AI is a broad concept, the critical categories we need to think about are based on an AI&#8217;s <em>caliber</em>. There are three major AI caliber categories:</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 1) Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Weak AI</em>, Artificial Narrow Intelligence is AI that specializes in <em>one</em> area. There&#8217;s AI that can beat the world chess champion in chess, but that&#8217;s the only thing it does. Ask it to figure out a better way to store data on a hard drive, and it&#8217;ll look at you blankly.</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 2) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Strong AI</em>, or <em>Human-Level AI</em>, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a computer that is as smart as a human <em>across the board—</em>a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Creating AGI is a <em>much </em>harder task than creating ANI, and we&#8217;re yet to do it. Professor Linda Gottfredson describes intelligence as &#8220;a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.&#8221; AGI would be able to do all of those things as easily as you can.</p><p><strong>AI Caliber 3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> Oxford philosopher and leading AI thinker Nick Bostrom <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> superintelligence as &#8220;an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.&#8221; Artificial Superintelligence ranges from a computer that&#8217;s just a little smarter than a human to one that&#8217;s trillions of times smarter—across the board. ASI is the reason the topic of AI is such a spicy meatball and why the words immortality and extinction will both appear in these posts multiple times.</p><p>As of now, humans have conquered the lowest caliber of AI—ANI—in many ways, and it&#8217;s everywhere. The AI Revolution is the road from ANI, through AGI, to ASI—a road we may or may not survive but that, either way, will change everything.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take a close look at what the leading thinkers in the field believe this road looks like and why this revolution might happen way sooner than you might think:</p><h3>Where We Are Currently—A World Running on ANI</h3><p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency at a <em>specific </em>thing. A few examples:</p><ul><li>Cars are full of ANI systems, from the computer that figures out when the anti-lock brakes should kick in to the computer that tunes the parameters of the fuel injection systems. Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLyNDhxwpqNe3UeEmGHl8g\" target=\"_blank\">self-driving car</a>, which is being tested now, will contain robust ANI systems that allow it to perceive and react to the world around it.</li><li>Your phone is a little ANI factory. When you navigate using your map app, receive tailored music recommendations from Pandora, check tomorrow&#8217;s weather, talk to Siri, or dozens of other everyday activities, you&#8217;re using ANI.</li><li>Your email spam filter is a classic type of ANI—it starts off loaded with intelligence about how to figure out what&#8217;s spam and what&#8217;s not, and then it learns and tailors its intelligence to you as it gets experience with your particular preferences. The Nest Thermostat does the same thing as it starts to figure out your typical routine and act accordingly.</li><li>You know the whole creepy thing that goes on when you search for a product on Amazon and then you see that as a &#8220;recommended for you&#8221; product on a <em>different </em>site, or when Facebook somehow knows who it makes sense for you to add as a friend? That&#8217;s a network of ANI systems, working together to inform each other about who you are and what you like and then using that information to decide what to show you. Same goes for Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;People who bought this also bought&#8230;&#8221; thing—that&#8217;s an ANI system whose job it is to gather info from the behavior of millions of customers and synthesize that info to cleverly upsell you so you&#8217;ll buy more things.</li><li>Google Translate is another classic ANI system—impressively good at one narrow task. Voice recognition is another, and there are a bunch of apps that use those two ANIs as a tag team, allowing you to speak a sentence in one language and have the phone spit out the same sentence in another.</li><li>When your plane lands, it&#8217;s not a human that decides which gate it should go to. Just like it&#8217;s not a human that determined the price of your ticket.</li><li>The world&#8217;s best Checkers, Chess, Scrabble, Backgammon, and Othello players are now all ANI systems.</li><li>Google search is one large ANI brain with incredibly sophisticated methods for ranking pages and figuring out what to show you in particular. Same goes for Facebook&#8217;s Newsfeed.</li><li>And those are just in the consumer world. Sophisticated ANI systems are widely used in sectors and industries like military, manufacturing, and finance (algorithmic high-frequency AI traders account for more than half of equity shares traded on US markets<a href=\"#footnote2-6-3216\" id=\"note2-6-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a>), and in expert systems like those that help doctors make diagnoses and, most famously, IBM&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/\" target=\"_blank\">Watson</a>, who contained enough facts and understood coy Trebek-speak well enough to soundly beat the most prolific <em>Jeopardy</em> champions.</li></ul><p>ANI systems as they are now aren&#8217;t especially scary. At worst, a glitchy or badly-programmed ANI can cause an isolated catastrophe like knocking out a power grid, causing a harmful nuclear power plant malfunction, or triggering a financial markets disaster (like the <a href=\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/flash-crash-dow-popup.png\" target=\"_blank\">2010 Flash Crash</a> when an ANI program reacted the wrong way to an unexpected situation and caused the stock market to briefly plummet, taking $1 trillion of market value with it, only part of which was recovered when the mistake was corrected).</p><p>But while ANI doesn&#8217;t have the capability to cause an <em>existential threat</em>, we should see this increasingly large and complex ecosystem of relatively-harmless ANI as a precursor of the world-altering hurricane that&#8217;s on the way. Each new ANI innovation quietly adds another brick onto the road to AGI and ASI. Or as Aaron Saenz <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2010/08/10/we-live-in-a-jungle-of-artificial-intelligence-that-will-spawn-sentience/\" target=\"_blank\">sees it</a>, our world&#8217;s ANI systems &#8220;are like the amino acids in the early Earth&#8217;s primordial ooze&#8221;—the inanimate stuff of life that, one unexpected day, woke up.</p><h3><strong>The Road From ANI to AGI</strong></h3><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">Why It&#8217;s So Hard</span></p><p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p><p>What&#8217;s interesting is that the hard parts of trying to build AGI (a computer as smart as humans in <em>general</em>, not just at one narrow specialty) are not intuitively what you&#8217;d think they are. Build a computer that can multiply two ten-digit numbers in a split second—incredibly easy. Build one that can look at a dog and answer whether it&#8217;s a dog or a cat—spectacularly difficult. Make AI that can beat any human in chess? Done. Make one that can read a paragraph from a six-year-old&#8217;s picture book and not just recognize the words but understand the <em>meaning</em> of them? Google is currently spending <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/01/google-buying-way-making-brain-irrelevant/\" target=\"_blank\">billions</a> of dollars trying to do it. Hard things—like calculus, financial market strategy, and language translation—are mind-numbingly easy for a computer, while easy things—like vision, motion, movement, and perception—are insanely hard for it. Or, as computer scientist Donald Knuth puts it, “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking.'&#8221;<a href=\"#footnote2-7-3216\" id=\"note2-7-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a><p>What you quickly realize when you think about this is that those things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated, and they only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of million years of animal evolution. When you reach your hand up toward an object, the muscles, tendons, and bones in your shoulder, elbow, and wrist instantly perform a long series of physics operations, in conjunction with your eyes, to allow you to move your hand in a straight line through three dimensions. It seems effortless to you because you have perfected software in your brain for doing it. Same idea goes for why it&#8217;s not that malware is dumb for not being able to figure out the slanty word recognition test when you sign up for a new account on a site—it&#8217;s that your brain is super impressive for being <em>able </em>to.</p><p>On the other hand, multiplying big numbers or playing chess are new activities for biological creatures and we haven&#8217;t had any time to evolve a proficiency at them, so a computer doesn&#8217;t need to work too hard to beat us. Think about it—which would you rather do, build a program that could multiply big numbers or one that could understand the essence of a B well enough that you could show it a B in any one of thousands of unpredictable fonts or handwriting and it could instantly know it was a B?</p><p>One fun example—when you look at this, you and a computer both can figure out that it&#8217;s a rectangle with two distinct shades, alternating:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.21-AM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3228\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.21-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-21 at 12.59.21 AM\" width=\"195\" height=\"300\" /></a></p><p>Tied so far. But if you pick up the black and reveal the whole image&#8230;</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.54-AM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3227\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-12.59.54-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-21 at 12.59.54 AM\" width=\"181\" height=\"299\" /></a></p><p>&#8230;you have no problem giving a full description of the various opaque and translucent cylinders, slats, and 3-D corners, but the computer would fail miserably. It would describe what it sees—a variety of two-dimensional shapes in several different shades—which is actually what&#8217;s there. Your brain is doing a ton of fancy shit to interpret the implied depth, shade-mixing, and room lighting the picture is trying to portray.<a href=\"#footnote2-8-3216\" id=\"note2-8-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">8</a> And looking at the picture below, a computer sees a two-dimensional white, black, and gray collage, while you easily see what it really is—a photo of an entirely-black, 3-D rock:</p><div id=\"attachment_3226\" style=\"width: 567px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/article-2053686-0E8BC15900000578-845_634x330.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3226\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/article-2053686-0E8BC15900000578-845_634x330.jpg\" alt=\"article-2053686-0E8BC15900000578-845_634x330\" width=\"557\" height=\"290\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: Matthew Lloyd</p></div><p>And everything we just mentioned is still only taking in stagnant information and processing it. To be human-level intelligent, a computer would have to understand things like the difference between subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased, relieved, content, satisfied, and glad, and why <em>Braveheart </em>was great but <em>The Patriot</em> was terrible.</p><p>Daunting.</p><p>So how do we get there?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">First Key to Creating AGI: Increasing Computational Power</span></p><p>One thing that definitely needs to happen for AGI to be a possibility is an increase in the power of computer hardware. If an AI system is going to be as intelligent as the brain, it&#8217;ll need to equal the brain&#8217;s raw computing capacity.</p><p>One way to express this capacity is in the total calculations per second (cps) the brain could manage, and you could come to this number by figuring out the maximum cps of each structure in the brain and then adding them all together.</p><p>Ray Kurzweil came up with a shortcut by taking someone&#8217;s professional estimate for the cps of one structure and that structure&#8217;s weight compared to that of the whole brain and then multiplying proportionally to get an estimate for the total. Sounds a little iffy, but he did this a bunch of times with various professional estimates of different regions, and the total always arrived in the same ballpark—around 10<sup>16</sup>, or 10 quadrillion cps.</p><p>Currently, the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputer, China&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-china-supercomputer-idUSKCN0J11VV20141117\" target=\"_blank\">Tianhe-2</a>, has actually beaten that number, clocking in at about 34 quadrillion cps. But Tianhe-2 is also a dick, taking up 720 square meters of space, using 24 megawatts of power (the brain runs on just <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/neuron-computer-chips-could-overcome-power-limitations-digital\" target=\"_blank\">20 watts</a>), and costing $390 million to build. Not especially applicable to wide usage, or even most commercial or industrial usage yet.</p><p>Kurzweil suggests that we think about the state of computers by looking at how many cps you can buy for $1,000. When that number reaches human-level—10 quadrillion cps—then that&#8217;ll mean AGI could become a very real part of life.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mooreslaw.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> is a historically-reliable rule that the world&#8217;s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially. Looking at how this relates to Kurzweil&#8217;s cps/$1,000 metric, we&#8217;re currently at about 10 trillion cps/$1,000, right on pace with this graph&#8217;s predicted trajectory:<a href=\"#footnote2-9-3216\" id=\"note2-9-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3229\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg\" alt=\"PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"512\" /></a></p><p>So the world&#8217;s $1,000 computers are now beating the mouse brain and they&#8217;re at about a thousandth of human level. This doesn&#8217;t sound like much until you remember that we were at about a trillionth of human level in 1985, a billionth in 1995, and a millionth in 2005. Being at a thousandth in 2015 puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain.</p><p>So on the hardware side, the raw power needed for AGI is technically available now, in China, and we&#8217;ll be ready for affordable, widespread AGI-caliber hardware within 10 years. But raw computational power alone doesn&#8217;t make a computer generally intelligent—the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;\">Second Key to Creating AGI: Making it Smart</span></p><p>This is the icky part. The truth is, no one really knows how to make it smart—we&#8217;re still debating how to make a computer human-level intelligent and capable of knowing what a dog and a weird-written B and a mediocre movie is. But there are a bunch of far-fetched strategies out there and at some point, one of them will work. Here are the three most common strategies I came across:</p><h4><strong>1) Plagiarize the brain. </strong></h4><p>This is like scientists toiling over how that kid who sits next to them in class is so smart and keeps doing so well on the tests, and even though they keep studying diligently, they can&#8217;t do nearly as well as that kid, and then they finally decide &#8220;k fuck it I&#8217;m just gonna copy that kid&#8217;s answers.&#8221; It makes sense—we&#8217;re stumped trying to build a super-complex computer, and there happens to be a perfect prototype for one in each of our heads.</p><p>The science world is working hard on reverse engineering the brain to figure out how evolution made such a rad thing—<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/08/reverse-engineering-brain-kurzweil/\" target=\"_blank\">optimistic estimates</a> say we can do this by 2030. Once we do that, we&#8217;ll know all the secrets of how the brain runs so powerfully and efficiently and we can draw inspiration from it and steal its innovations. One example of computer architecture that mimics the brain is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor &#8220;neurons,&#8221; connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing—like an infant brain. The way it &#8220;learns&#8221; is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it&#8217;s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it&#8217;s told it was wrong, those pathways&#8217; connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task. The brain learns a bit like this but in a more sophisticated way, and as we continue to study the brain, we&#8217;re discovering ingenious new ways to take advantage of neural circuitry.</p><p>More extreme plagiarism involves a strategy called &#8220;whole brain emulation,&#8221; where the goal is to slice a real brain into thin layers, scan each one, use software to assemble an accurate reconstructed 3-D model, and then implement the model on a powerful computer. We&#8217;d then have a computer officially capable of everything the brain is capable of—it would just need to learn and gather information. If engineers get <em>really </em>good, they&#8217;d be able to emulate a real brain with such exact accuracy that the brain&#8217;s full personality and memory would be intact once the brain architecture has been uploaded to a computer. If the brain belonged to Jim right before he passed away, the computer would now wake up as Jim (<a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html\" target=\"_blank\">?</a>), which would be a robust human-level AGI, and we could now work on turning Jim into an unimaginably smart ASI, which he&#8217;d probably be really excited about.</p><p>How far are we from achieving whole brain emulation? Well so far, we&#8217;ve <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">not yet</span><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/weve-put-worms-mind-lego-robot-body-180953399/?no-ist\" target=\"_blank\">just recently</a> been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons. The human brain contains 100 billion. If that makes it seem like a hopeless project, remember the power of exponential progress—now that we&#8217;ve conquered the tiny worm brain, an ant might happen before too long, followed by a mouse, and suddenly this will seem much more plausible.</p><h4><strong>2) Try to make evolution do what it did before but for us this time.</strong></h4><p>So if we decide the smart kid&#8217;s test is too hard to copy, we can try to copy the way he <em>studies</em> for the tests instead.</p><p>Here&#8217;s something we know. Building a computer as powerful as the brain <em>is </em>possible—our own brain&#8217;s evolution is proof. And if the brain is just too complex for us to emulate, we could try to emulate <em>evolution </em>instead. The fact is, even if we can emulate a brain, that might be like trying to build an airplane by copying a bird&#8217;s wing-flapping motions—often, machines are best designed using a fresh, machine-oriented approach, not by mimicking biology exactly.</p><p>So how can we simulate evolution to build AGI? The method, called &#8220;genetic algorithms,&#8221; would work something like this: there would be a performance-and-evaluation process that would happen again and again (the same way biological creatures &#8220;perform&#8221; by living life and are &#8220;evaluated&#8221; by whether they manage to reproduce or not). A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be <em>bred </em>with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated. Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own.</p><p>The downside of copying evolution is that evolution likes to take a billion years to do things and we want to do this in a few decades.</p><p>But we have a lot of advantages over evolution. First, evolution has no foresight and works randomly—it produces more unhelpful mutations than helpful ones, but we would control the process so it would only be driven by beneficial glitches and targeted tweaks. Secondly, evolution doesn&#8217;t <em>aim </em>for anything, including intelligence—sometimes an environment might even select <em>against </em>higher intelligence (since it uses a lot of energy). We, on the other hand, could specifically direct this evolutionary process toward increasing intelligence. Third, to select for intelligence, evolution has to innovate in a bunch of other ways to facilitate intelligence—like revamping the ways cells produce energy—when we can remove those extra burdens and use things like electricity. It&#8217;s no doubt we&#8217;d be much, much faster than evolution—but it&#8217;s still not clear whether we&#8217;ll be able to improve upon evolution <em>enough</em> to make this a viable strategy.</p><h4 class=\"p1\"><b>3) Make this whole thing the computer&#8217;s problem, not ours.</b></h4><p class=\"p1\">This is when scientists get desperate and try to program the test to take itself. But it might be the most promising method we have.</p><p class=\"p1\">The idea is that we&#8217;d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself—allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own <em>architecture</em>. We&#8217;d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development. And that would be their main job—figuring out how to make <em>themselves</em> smarter. More on this later.</p><h4 class=\"p1\"><strong>All of This Could Happen Soon</strong></h4><p class=\"p1\">Rapid advancements in hardware and innovative experimentation with software are happening simultaneously, and AGI could creep up on us quickly and unexpectedly for two main reasons:</p><p class=\"p1\">1) Exponential growth is intense and what seems like a snail&#8217;s pace of advancement can quickly race upwards—this GIF illustrates this concept nicely:</p><div id=\"attachment_3225\" style=\"width: 639px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-3225 size-full\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif\" alt=\" \" width=\"629\" height=\"354\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p></div><p class=\"p1\">2) When it comes to software, progress can seem slow, but then one epiphany can instantly change the rate of advancement (kind of like the way science, during the time humans thought the universe was geocentric, was having difficulty calculating how the universe worked, but then the discovery that it was heliocentric suddenly made everything <em>much </em>easier). Or, when it comes to something like a computer that improves itself, we might seem far away but actually be just one tweak of the system away from having it become 1,000 times more effective and zooming upward to human-level intelligence.</p><h3 class=\"p1\">The Road From AGI to ASI</h3><p class=\"p1\">At some point, we&#8217;ll have achieved AGI—computers with human-level general intelligence. Just a bunch of people and computers living together in equality.</p><p class=\"p1\">Oh actually not at all.</p><p class=\"p1\">The thing is, AGI with an identical level of intelligence and computational capacity as a human would still have significant advantages over humans. Like:</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span></p><ul><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Speed. </strong>The brain&#8217;s neurons max out at around 200 Hz, while today&#8217;s microprocessors (which are much slower than they will be when we reach AGI) run at 2 GHz, or 10 million times faster than our neurons. And the brain&#8217;s internal communications, which can move at about 120 m/s, are horribly outmatched by a computer&#8217;s ability to communicate optically at the speed of light.</li><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Size and storage. </strong>The brain is locked into its size by the shape of our skulls, and it couldn&#8217;t get much bigger anyway, or the 120 m/s internal communications would take too long to get from one brain structure to another. Computers can expand to any physical size, allowing far more hardware to be put to work, a much larger working memory (RAM), and a longterm memory (hard drive storage) that has both far greater capacity and precision than our own.</li><li class=\"p1\"><strong>Reliability and durability.</strong> It&#8217;s not only the memories of a computer that would be more precise. Computer transistors are more accurate than biological neurons, and they&#8217;re less likely to deteriorate (and can be repaired or replaced if they do). Human brains also get fatigued easily, while computers can run nonstop, at peak performance, 24/7.</li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Software:</strong></span></p><ul><li><strong>Editability, upgradability, and a wider breadth of possibility. </strong>Unlike the human brain, computer software can receive updates and fixes and can be easily experimented on. The upgrades could also span to areas where human brains are weak. Human vision software is superbly advanced, while its complex engineering capability is pretty low-grade. Computers could match the human on vision software but could <em>also </em>become equally optimized in engineering and any other area.</li><li><b>Collective capability. </b>Humans crush all other species at building a vast collective intelligence. Beginning with the development of language and the forming of large, dense communities, advancing through the inventions of writing and printing, and now intensified through tools like the internet, humanity&#8217;s collective intelligence is one of the major reasons we&#8217;ve been able to get so far ahead of all other species. And computers will be way better at it than we are. A worldwide network of AI running a particular program could regularly sync with itself so that anything any one computer learned would be instantly uploaded to all other computers. The group could also take on one goal as a unit, because there wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be dissenting opinions and motivations and self-interest, like we have within the human population.<a href=\"#footnote2-10-3216\" id=\"note2-10-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a></li></ul><p class=\"p1\">AI, which will likely get to AGI by being programmed to self-improve, wouldn&#8217;t see &#8220;human-level intelligence&#8221; as some important milestone—it&#8217;s only a relevant marker from our point of view—and wouldn&#8217;t have any reason to &#8220;stop&#8221; at our level. And given the advantages over us that even human intelligence-equivalent AGI would have, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that it would only hit human intelligence for a brief instant before racing onwards to the realm of superior-to-human intelligence.</p><p class=\"p1\">This may shock the shit out of us when it happens. The reason is that from <em>our </em>perspective, A) while the intelligence of different kinds of animals varies, the main characteristic we&#8217;re aware of about any animal&#8217;s intelligence is that it&#8217;s far lower than ours, and B) we view the smartest humans as WAY smarter than the dumbest humans. Kind of like this:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3250\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg\" alt=\"Intelligence\" width=\"550\" height=\"432\" /></a></p><p class=\"p1\">So as AI zooms upward in intelligence toward us, we&#8217;ll see it as simply becoming smarter, <em>for an animal. </em>Then, when it hits the lowest capacity of humanity—Nick Bostrom uses the term &#8220;the village idiot&#8221;—we&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh wow, it&#8217;s like a dumb human. Cute!&#8221; The only thing is, in the grand spectrum of intelligence, <em>all </em>humans, from the village idiot to Einstein, are within a very small range—so <em>just </em>after hitting village idiot-level and being declared to be AGI, it&#8217;ll suddenly be smarter than Einstein and we won&#8217;t know what hit us:</p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3248\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png\" alt=\"Intelligence2\" width=\"550\" height=\"449\" /></a></p><p>And what happens…after that?</p><p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 17pt;\">An Intelligence Explosion</span></p><p class=\"p1\">I hope you enjoyed normal time, because this is when this topic gets unnormal and scary, and it&#8217;s gonna stay that way from here forward. I want to pause here to remind you that every single thing I&#8217;m going to say is real—real science and real forecasts of the future from a large array of the most respected thinkers and scientists. Just keep remembering that.</p><p class=\"p1\">Anyway, as I said above, most of our current models for getting to AGI involve the AI getting there by self-improvement. And once it gets to AGI, even systems that formed and grew<i></i>through methods that didn&#8217;t involve self-improvement would now be smart enough to begin self-improving if they wanted to.<a href=\"#footnote-3-3216\" id=\"note-3-3216\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a><p class=\"p1\">And here&#8217;s where we get to an intense concept: <strong>recursive self-improvement.</strong> It works like this—</p><p class=\"p1\">An AI system at a certain level—let&#8217;s say human village idiot—is programmed with the goal of improving its own intelligence. Once it does, it&#8217;s <em>smarter—</em>maybe at this point it&#8217;s at Einstein&#8217;s level—so now when it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and it can make bigger leaps. These leaps make it <em>much </em>smarter than any human, allowing it to make even <em>bigger</em> leaps. As the leaps grow larger and happen more rapidly, the AGI soars upwards in intelligence and soon reaches the superintelligent level of an ASI system. This is called an Intelligence Explosion,<a href=\"#footnote2-11-3216\" id=\"note2-11-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> and it&#8217;s the ultimate example of The Law of Accelerating Returns.</p><p class=\"p1\">There is some debate about how soon AI will reach human-level general intelligence—the median year on a survey of hundreds of scientists about when they believed we&#8217;d be more likely than not to have reached AGI was 2040<a href=\"#footnote2-12-3216\" id=\"note2-12-3216\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a>—that&#8217;s only 25 years from now, which doesn&#8217;t sound that huge until you consider that many of the thinkers in this field think it&#8217;s likely that the progression from AGI to ASI happens <em>very </em>quickly. Like—this could happen:</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>It takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general intelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world around it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting that milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to definitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI, 170,000 times more intelligent than a human.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ—we don&#8217;t have a word for an IQ of 12,952.</p><p class=\"p1\">What we do know is that humans&#8217; utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: <em>with intelligence comes power.</em> Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—<em>and this might happen</em><em> in the next few decades.</em></p><p class=\"p1\">If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time—everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on Earth—all suddenly possible. Also possible is the immediate end of all life on Earth. As far as we&#8217;re concerned, if an ASI comes to being, there is now an omnipotent God on Earth—and the all-important question for us is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 19pt;\"><strong>Will it be a nice God?</strong></span></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s the topic of <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">Part 2 of this post</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p class=\"p1\"><em>Sources at the bottom of <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html\">Part 2</a>.</em></p><p class=\"p1\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\">Related Wait But Why Posts</span></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Fermi Paradox</a> &#8211; Why don&#8217;t we see any signs of alien life?</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\">How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars</a> &#8211; A post I got to work on with Elon Musk and one that reframed my mental picture of the future.</p><p>Or for something totally different and yet somehow related, <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></p><p>And here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wait-But-Why-Year-One-ebook/dp/B00TXYJOZG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424988766&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tim+urban\" target=\"_blank\">Year 1 of Wait But Why</a> on an ebook.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote-1-3216\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Okay so there are two different kinds of notes now.

Here’s the deal: Two of the jelly beans on the stump are poisonous—you’ll die within 30 seconds of eating either one of them. But one of the jelly beans isn’t poisonous and won’t harm you at all. All three of the jelly beans are delicious. The situation works like this: You pick one of the jelly beans and eat it, and if you happen to pick the non-poisonous one, you’re free to go. Cool?”</p><p>“Cool,” you say.

I don’t care. But you need to eat one of them in the next 10 seconds.”</p><p>So the question is—which jelly bean do you eat? Does it even matter?</p><p>Stop and think about what you’d do in this situation before moving on.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Here’s the weird thing about that question—yes, it matters. It matters a <em>lot</em>. Knowing only what you know in that situation, there is one <em>clear </em>choice: the red jelly bean.</p><p>My guess is that when you thought about it, you decided to stick with your original decision and eat the green one. Because with two jelly beans left, you had a 50/50 shot, and it feels better to stick with your original choice than to switch. Right?</p><p>Wrong. Very wrong.</p><p>The green jelly bean is <em>double </em>as likely to kill you as the red jelly bean. Here’s why:</p><p>When you initially picked the green jelly bean, there was a 1/3 chance that it was the safe one to eat, and a 2/3 chance that it was poisonous and the safe one was still on the stump. When the man removed a poisonous blue jelly bean from the stump, it told you no new info about the green jelly bean in your hand—that still had a 1/3 chance of being safe. But removing the blue jelly bean told you a <em>lot </em>about the red jelly bean—it told you that if the safe jelly bean <em>had</em> been on the stump, the red one is safe.</p><p>Put another way, <em>if</em> you picked a poisonous jelly bean—which you would do two-thirds of the time—then choosing to switch after he removes one <em>will </em>save you every time. If you picked the safe one to start off with—which happens one-third of the time—then switching will kill you. So switching is a good choice two-thirds of the time.</p><p>You could run a pretty quick simulation: If you ran this process 300 times and picked the green jelly bean each time, about 100 of the times, it would be safe to eat and switching to the red bean would kill you. The other 200 or so times, the green jelly bean would be poisonous and switching to the red bean would save you.</p><p>One other way to look at it is this—say instead of three jelly beans, the guy puts down 1,000 jelly beans and tells you again that only one is safe. So this time, instead of two poisonous jelly beans to contend with, there are 999. He labels them each with a number, 1-1,000, and asks you to choose. You choose jelly bean 267 and hold it in your hand, leaving 999 jelly beans on the stump. Then, while you hold onto jelly bean 267, the man removes 998 jelly beans from the stump and tells you that all 998 of them are poisonous. All that’s left on the stump is jelly bean 749. He tells you you can stick with jelly bean 267 or switch to jelly bean 749—what would you do?</p><p>You’d switch. Jelly bean 267 has a 1/1,000 chance of being safe. There’s nothing special about it. You picked it and it sat on the sidelines as 998 poisonous jelly beans were removed from the 999 on the stump. Jelly bean 749 <em>is </em>special—it’s the <em>survivor</em>. There’s a tiny, 1/1,000 chance that you <em>happened </em>to pick the non-poisonous jelly bean, and if that’s the case, then the man just took 998 jelly beans at random from 999 that were all poisonous. But far more likely is that the jelly bean you picked is one of the poisonous ones, meaning the stump only <em>has</em><em> </em>998<em> </em>poisonous jelly beans on it. So when the man says he’s going to take 998 poisonous ones off the stump, he has no choice—he <em>has </em>to leave the safe one there, so jelly bean 749 is left there very <em>intentionally</em>. Jelly bean 749 is the one you want to eat—it’s been through the tough test and survived, while the one in your hand survived nothing and is super dangerous to eat.</p><p>Back to our three jelly bean situation. Same deal. The green jelly bean in your hand and its 1/3 odds of being safe were kept in isolation during the jelly bean removal process, so the 1/3 odds are still valid.

And there’s a 2/3 chance that you were wrong.</p><p>But over the next week, Marilyn received over 10,000 letters, including over 1,000 from PhD’s—and almost all of the letters were berating her for her huge mistake. One PhD put it like this:<a href=\"#footnote2-1-4863\" id=\"note2-1-4863\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a><p class=\"p1\"><em>“You blew it, and you blew it big! Since you seem to have difficulty grasping the basic principle at work here, I’ll explain. After the host reveals a goat, you now have a one-in-two chance of being correct. Whether you change your selection or not, the odds are the same. There is enough mathematical illiteracy in this country, and we don’t need the world’s highest IQ propagating more. Shame!”</em></p><p class=\"p1\">When people first hear the Monty Hall three-doors problem (or the Tim Urban inane jelly bean story), it doesn’t matter how smart they are—they almost always get it wrong and fervently believe that the final two options have an equal probability of being correct. Which is why almost everyone chooses not to switch their decision when given the opportunity.</p><p class=\"p1\">One note is that this problem <em>only </em>works with three key conditions in place:</p><p class=\"p1\">1) The host must always open a door, and it has to be one that was not picked by the contestant.</p><p class=\"p1\">2) The host must know where the car is and always open a door with a goat behind it.</p><p class=\"p1\">3) The host will always give you the option to switch your choice.</p><p class=\"p1\">If any of those conditions isn’t there, the problem doesn’t work. For example, if the host doesn’t know where the car is and takes a guess by opening one of the other two doors, and a goat runs out, then it’s no longer better to switch your choice—it’s 50/50.<a href=\"#footnote-2-4863\" id=\"note-2-4863\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a><p class=\"p1\">A third version of this problem is the Three Prisoners problem, which I’ll explain in this footnote<a href=\"#footnote-3-4863\" id=\"note-3-4863\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> for those who are interested.</p><p class=\"p1\">So—</p><p class=\"p1\">Has it clicked?

If Prisoner C is being pardoned, tell me that Prisoner B is being executed.

Here&#8217;s the deal: Two of the jelly beans on the stump are poisonous—you&#8217;ll die within 30 seconds of eating either one of them. But one of the jelly beans isn&#8217;t poisonous and won&#8217;t harm you at all. All three of the jelly beans are delicious. The situation works like this: You pick one of the jelly beans and eat it, and if you happen to pick the non-poisonous one, you&#8217;re free to go. Cool?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Cool,&#8221; you say.

I don&#8217;t care. But you need to eat one of them in the next 10 seconds.&#8221;</p><p>So the question is—which jelly bean do you eat? Does it even matter?</p><p>Stop and think about what you&#8217;d do in this situation before moving on.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>Here&#8217;s the weird thing about that question—yes, it matters. It matters a <em>lot</em>. Knowing only what you know in that situation, there is one <em>clear </em>choice: the red jelly bean.</p><p>My guess is that when you thought about it, you decided to stick with your original decision and eat the green one. Because with two jelly beans left, you had a 50/50 shot, and it feels better to stick with your original choice than to switch. Right?</p><p>Wrong. Very wrong.</p><p>The green jelly bean is <em>double </em>as likely to kill you as the red jelly bean. Here&#8217;s why:</p><p>When you initially picked the green jelly bean, there was a 1/3 chance that it was the safe one to eat, and a 2/3 chance that it was poisonous and the safe one was still on the stump. When the man removed a poisonous blue jelly bean from the stump, it told you no new info about the green jelly bean in your hand—that still had a 1/3 chance of being safe. But removing the blue jelly bean told you a <em>lot </em>about the red jelly bean—it told you that if the safe jelly bean <em>had</em> been on the stump, the red one is safe.</p><p>Put another way, <em>if</em> you picked a poisonous jelly bean—which you would do two-thirds of the time—then choosing to switch after he removes one <em>will </em>save you every time. If you picked the safe one to start off with—which happens one-third of the time—then switching will kill you. So switching is a good choice two-thirds of the time.</p><p>You could run a pretty quick simulation: If you ran this process 300 times and picked the green jelly bean each time, about 100 of the times, it would be safe to eat and switching to the red bean would kill you. The other 200 or so times, the green jelly bean would be poisonous and switching to the red bean would save you.</p><p>One other way to look at it is this—say instead of three jelly beans, the guy puts down 1,000 jelly beans and tells you again that only one is safe. So this time, instead of two poisonous jelly beans to contend with, there are 999. He labels them each with a number, 1-1,000, and asks you to choose. You choose jelly bean 267 and hold it in your hand, leaving 999 jelly beans on the stump. Then, while you hold onto jelly bean 267, the man removes 998 jelly beans from the stump and tells you that all 998 of them are poisonous. All that&#8217;s left on the stump is jelly bean 749. He tells you you can stick with jelly bean 267 or switch to jelly bean 749—what would you do?</p><p>You&#8217;d switch. Jelly bean 267 has a 1/1,000 chance of being safe. There&#8217;s nothing special about it. You picked it and it sat on the sidelines as 998 poisonous jelly beans were removed from the 999 on the stump. Jelly bean 749 <em>is </em>special—it&#8217;s the <em>survivor</em>. There&#8217;s a tiny, 1/1,000 chance that you <em>happened </em>to pick the non-poisonous jelly bean, and if that&#8217;s the case, then the man just took 998 jelly beans at random from 999 that were all poisonous. But far more likely is that the jelly bean you picked is one of the poisonous ones, meaning the stump only <em>has</em><em> </em>998<em> </em>poisonous jelly beans on it. So when the man says he&#8217;s going to take 998 poisonous ones off the stump, he has no choice—he <em>has </em>to leave the safe one there, so jelly bean 749 is left there very <em>intentionally</em>. Jelly bean 749 is the one you want to eat—it&#8217;s been through the tough test and survived, while the one in your hand survived nothing and is super dangerous to eat.</p><p>Back to our three jelly bean situation. Same deal. The green jelly bean in your hand and its 1/3 odds of being safe were kept in isolation during the jelly bean removal process, so the 1/3 odds are still valid. But the red jelly bean <em>survived </em>the removal process and all the safe choices that might have been on the stump are now consolidated into the red jelly bean. That&#8217;s why you switch.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p><p>As many of you have figured out, I didn&#8217;t make this up.

For example, if the host doesn&#8217;t know where the car is and takes a guess by opening one of the other two doors, and a goat runs out, then it&#8217;s no longer better to switch your choice—it&#8217;s 50/50.<a href=\"#footnote-2-4863\" id=\"note-2-4863\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a><p class=\"p1\">A third version of this problem is the Three Prisoners problem, which I&#8217;ll explain in this footnote<a href=\"#footnote-3-4863\" id=\"note-3-4863\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> for those who are interested.</p><p class=\"p1\">So—</p><p class=\"p1\">Has it clicked?

All I ask is that you tell me one of the other two guys who is being executed. If Prisoner B is being pardoned, tell me that Prisoner C is being executed.

Prisoner A is pumped, thinking that he now has a 50% chance of survival—but he doesn&#8217;t. He has the same 1/3 chance of survival—what&#8217;s changed is that Prisoner C now has a 2/3 chance of survival.<a href=\"#note-3-4863\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div><div class=\"footnotes2\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote2-1-4863\" class=\"footnote2\"><p><a href=\"http://marilynvossavant.com/game-show-problem/\" target=\"_blank\">marilynvossavant.com: Game Show Problem</a><a href=\"#note2-1-4863\" class=\"footnote2-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li></ol></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/the-jellybean-problem.html\">The Jelly Bean Problem</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>
") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/the-jellybean-problem.html/feed") (slash:comments nil "0"))) ("Doing a TED Talk: The Full Story" "<p>You’ve probably heard this Seinfeld joke:</p><p><em>According to most studies, people’s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you’re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.</em></p><p>Knowing humans, this shouldn’t be that surprising. I’ve mentioned <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">before</a> that we all have this problem where we’re weirdly obsessed with what other people think of us, so it makes sense that public speaking should be our collective phobia.</p><p>But then we also live in a world where public speaking can happen to any of us at any time. Even if you never give an official “talk,” there’ll be some other time when you have to give a big toast at a wedding or present in front of a big group at work or speak at a funeral or some other ceremony. Very few of us are safe.</p><p>Over the last couple years, as I’ve done a small amount of Wait But Why-related public speaking, I’ve been able to slowly get over the fear. I’ve learned that if you just be yourself and talk like you normally do, it’s usually received well by the audience, even if you’re clearly nervous.</p><p>And that was all fine until August of 2015, when I was invited to do a TED Talk.</p><p>The issue is, a TED Talk is not a speaking gig. In a speaking gig, I stand in front of a group of people and say stuff. That’s not what a TED Talk is. A TED Talk is a widely-distributed short film, except the only actor is my face and the only plot is me saying words out of my face and the only choreographer is my nervous pacing and awkward arm-flailing, and instead of a bunch of cuts and different shots and a long editing process, there’s just one do-or-die take, with no second chances.</p><p>No, what? No. Obviously not. Who would <em>ever </em>agree to do something like that.</p><p>But here’s the problem: Who turns down TED? Not really an option, right? Let’s pause to go through some background:</p><p>TED actually started way back in 1984, founded by <a href=\"https://www.nantucketproject.com/idea-films/rsw\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Saul Wurman</a>, as a small, Silicon Valley annual gathering. The name is an acronym for Wurman’s intention for the focus of the conference: Technology, Entertainment, Design. Through the 1990s, the conference grew both in attendance and in the scope of its topics.</p><p>In 2002, media entrepreneur Chris Anderson bought TED from Wurman (through a non-profit he owns) and has run it ever since. He broadened TED’s content focus to “ideas worth spreading,” and in 2006, TED began doing something that would launch the brand into the stratosphere—they put the talks online.</p><p>I first heard of TED in 2008, when someone sent me Jill Bolte Taylor’s <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">amazing talk</a> about what she learned from the experience of having a stroke. You probably first heard of TED around the same time. And a few years later, almost everyone knew what a TED Talk was. Anderson describes TED’s rise to global prominence like this:</p><p><em>It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it’s about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as “ideas worth spreading,” building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-1-4737\" id=\"note2-1-4737\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a><p>The TED brand has expanded in a lot of ways, but maybe most notably through TEDx conferences. This can be a little confusing, so here’s the deal: There’s still one annual TED conference, a week-long event in Vancouver, and it’s run by the TED staff. A TEDx conference is independently run, but it has to follow a set of guidelines laid out by TED so that it fits with the overall brand. There are now over 1,500 annual TEDx events that happen in over 130 countries, some of them major, high-profile conferences;<a href=\"#footnote-1-4737\" id=\"note-1-4737\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> others tiny and little-known. The best TEDx talks are posted on TED.com, alongside the talks that happen at the main conference in Vancouver.</p><p>The thing I was asked to speak at was the big Vancouver one. I say this not only to brag, but also to explain why this whole thing had me freaking out so much. The same thing that made it extra extra scary also made it extra extra not turn-downable.</p><p>So I accepted.</p><p>As I thought through what I had just committed myself to, I identified a number of concerns, like me not having a topic, or the fact that TED Talks are short and narrow and I tend to be the opposite. But perhaps most worrying was the prospect of this being an Exact Script situation. Let me explain (if you’d rather just read the rest of my TED story, skip down to the comic)—</p><p>When you speak in public, you have three main options about how to go about it, and they fall along a spectrum:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4749\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4749\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png\" alt=\"Prep Spectrum 1\" width=\"653\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-300x95.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-768x244.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-600x191.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png 1574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" /></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) Wing it</strong></span></p><p>At the cockiest end of the spectrum, you have the option of completely winging it. This involves no planning—you just get up there and figure out what you want to say once you’re talking. You be yourself and let the moment carry you.</p><p>This takes some hardcore self-confidence, and it only works if you’re <em>really </em>good, and if you’re in the right mood and in front of the right crowd. It’s a really great way to do a really bad talk, and should probably be kept to super-casual things like impromptu dinner toasts.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) Talk through a set structure</strong></span></p><p>Here, you have a clear structure in your head or a list of bullet points on a notecard, and then you simply talk through it. But importantly, you haven’t scripted sentences exactly—if you did the talk five times, it would come out differently each time, but the general content would be the same. To do this, you have to be super comfortable with the content of what you want to say.</p><p>When you use this method, you come off like a human, because you’re actually coming up with real sentences as you go, which is how a normal person talks. Your brain is focused on the content of what you’re saying, and your words are emerging directly from your current thoughts.</p><p>This isn’t an exact point on the spectrum but a range. On the left side of the range, closer to the winging it end, you have a few general bullets or slides, but you’ve planned almost nothing beyond that. Toward the right side, you’ve planned out almost exactly what you want to say, including the placement and wording of certain jokes or other key sentences, but it still comes out a little differently each time you do it.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3) Follow an exact script</strong></span></p><p>Here, on the other extreme end of the spectrum, you write the exact script of the talk ahead of time and deliver the talk on script, word for word. Some people might immediately assume this method will make a talk impersonal and robotic, but it’s more complicated than that—the exact script method has its own spectrum:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4747\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4747\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"Prep Spectrum 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-300x112.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-768x288.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-600x225.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png 2028w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3A) Read off a script</strong></span></p><p>This is simple: You write a script, and the talk is you reading it out loud. During the talk, you’re just acting as the messenger—you’re a functional medium connecting the thoughts of your past self to the present audience.</p><p>This is the safest and least stressful way to give a talk and it usually puts the audience to sleep, regardless of how good the content is. Audiences have a fine-tuned radar for when they’re listening to a person say something versus when they’re listening to a person <em>recite</em> something—in the latter case, the speaker isn’t really <em>there </em>in the room with the audience, which has a way of making everyone <em>really</em> want to start playing with their phone.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3B) <strong>Just barely memorized</strong></strong></span></p><p>As you move along the scripted spectrum from 3A to 3B, you go from entirely reading, to reading mostly but with some looks up at the audience, to mostly looking up at the audience with some glances down to the paper, to totally memorized with no paper in hand.</p><p>A paperless 3B speaker won’t come off much different than a 3A speaker. The 3B speaker isn’t technically reading off of a script, but he might as well be. Because his memorization of the script is fragile, his mind isn’t focused on the content of what he’s saying—it’s focused on reciting the words he memorized. He’ll struggle to make eye contact, and his sentences will come off just robotic enough to make the audience clear that he’s a mostly-unthinking messenger of a written script. Phones will be reached for.</p><p>The main difference is that while 3A is the safest method of all, 3B is the riskiest. Going for it without the paper when you only barely have the talk memorized is a great way to disastrously go blank mid-talk.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3C) Happy-Birthday-level memorized</strong></span></p><p>When you get to 3C, you don’t just have the script memorized, you have it memorized <em>cold</em>. And that’s a <em>key </em>distinction. If you’re in a restaurant and your table starts singing Happy Birthday to someone you’re with, you can join in with them even if you’re simultaneously taking a picture of the birthday girl, moving some stuff out of the way so the waiter has a place on the table to put the cake, observing the other people in the restaurant looking over and wishing this wasn’t happening, and four other things. It’s no problem—you can still sing the lyrics. You can do that because the lyrics to Happy Birthday aren’t coming out of your conscious mind—they’re coming out of your subconscious. They’re coming out automatically, and your conscious mind can focus entirely on other things while you’re singing.</p><p>That’s how well-memorized 3C is.</p><p>The people at TED refer to two tests you need to pass to qualify as Happy-Birthday-level memorized:</p><ol><li>If you record yourself saying the talk and play it back at 2x speed, can you say it out loud while it’s playing and stay <em>ahead </em>of the recording?</li><li>Can you recite the talk with no problem while simultaneously doing an unrelated task that requires attention, like following a recipe and measuring out the ingredients into a bowl?</li></ol><p>Memorizing something to this degree might seem like a daunting task, but everyone who’s ever acted in a play has done it. It’s not as impossible as it sounds, because the human brain is able to engrave things to that level if you just rehearse enough and sleep on it enough times.</p><p>When a speaker has memorized their talk to this extent, they <em>can </em>be in the room with the audience, even though they’re reciting a previously-written script, because their conscious mind is freed up to <em>think</em> about what they’re saying instead of tied up with the task of remembering which line comes next. This allows the speaker to make eye contact and to bring their live personality into the picture to reflect the words being said in real time.</p><p>I’d sum up the pros and cons of the five options like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4833\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4833\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2.png\" alt=\"Method graph\" width=\"700\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2-300x263.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2-768x672.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2-600x525.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p><p>On this chart, all three items in the key are bad. Those are the three things that can suck about public speaking. So high-up dots are bad. Looking at this chart, here are some conclusions:</p><ul><li>If and only if the talk is super low-stakes—like an impromptu toast at a group dinner—winging it is a good option. It’s the only method that takes no prep, and it’s also the least robotic, which is perfect in casual situations where seeming like you prepped is awkward. But unless you’re very rad, winging a big talk is a bad idea.</li></ul><ul><li>Method 2 is the best overall choice much of the time, scoring well on all three criteria. It’s not that hard to prep for, you sound like a human, and it isn’t that stressful because with nothing to memorize, there’s nothing to forget, so if you know your material well and you’re feeling confident, things will go fine. The worst case scenario is that you lose your confidence during the talk and flounder through it. That’s a bad outcome, but it’s not a disaster. But Method 2 does require you to be calm and collected, so if you’re really scared of public speaking, it’s probably not the way to go. It also leaves you open to variability—depending on how the words come out, you might deliver a better or worse talk—so if the stakes are <em>super </em>high, it’s not a great option unless you’re a seasoned pro.</li></ul><ul><li>Method 3A—reading off a script—is a pretty bad option, with one huge plus: It’s the least scary by far. For people who are <em>terrified </em>of public speaking, they may just want to cling to Method 3A’s leg and call it a day. But the safety comes at a high cost, in that you’re leaving yourself with almost no chance of delivering a great talk and a high chance of having the audience tune out. It should be noted that in certain high-gravitas situations, when it’s more of an official <em>speech </em>than a talk, the clearly-recited tone of a read speech can be appropriate, and even desired—like a graduation speech. In other cases, someone can be skilled enough at reading a script that they can do so in a human-seeming way. Obama is a good example—you often forget that he’s reading from a teleprompter most of the time you see him talk. But very few of us find ourselves involved with graduation speeches or teleprompters.</li></ul><ul><li>Method 3B—being memorized but just barely—is the worst of all worlds and should never happen. Never ever. If you’re at 3A and you decide to venture into memorization land and ditch the paper, you better be prepared to put in the time to get all the way to 3C, because here’s the deal: <img class=\"wp-image-4752 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph.png\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph\" width=\"615\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-300x160.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-768x410.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-600x320.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-374x200.png 374w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph.png 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" />Even if you feel like you have things memorized when you’re alone in your house, once you’re in front of the audience, all of these new factors come into play. Your adrenaline is pumping and super-charging your muscles, your nerves take a shit, and a million new things enter your consciousness—the faces of the audience, the clock ticking down with your time limit, your self-awareness of how you’re standing and what you’re doing with your hands, your regret over messing up a sentence 30 seconds ago. And that well-memorized talk is suddenly not coming to you so easily. 3B is all of the robotic-ness of 3A with none of the safety. Avoid.</li></ul><ul><li>When the stakes are high and you want to deliver your best talk—but you’re not a seasoned pro who can pull off Method 2—you’re left with only one option: 3C. You have to write a great script and memorize it <em>cold</em>. 3C gives everyone an option of basically <em>ensuring</em> that you give a great talk, with relatively low risk. You only have to do one thing: spend eternity prepping. 3C takes <em>forever</em>. Writing a great script means working on it a ton and carefully honing every sentence, and memorizing it to Happy Birthday level takes a huge amount more time. You’re essentially writing a play, casting yourself, and then learning the part well enough to act it on a stage with no fear of forgetting your lines. Preparing to this level is a nightmare—but if the stakes are high enough, it’s worth the time.</li></ul><ul><li>A quick note on wedding speeches. The best wedding speeches are usually Method 2 speeches, but most people are too scared to do that. But because they also don’t want to put <em>that </em>much effort into a wedding speech, most wedding speeches end up in 3A and 3B territory—which is why they’re usually pretty lame and boring and come along with a buzz of people quietly talking at the tables in the back. If you’re asked to give a wedding speech, don’t be a dick—it’s someone’s wedding. Either gather the guts to speak from the heart and go with Method 2, or put in the time it takes to get to 3C.</li></ul><p>Back to my situation. Over the past couple years, I had begun to find a groove doing not-that-high-stakes 30-to-60-minute talks using the off-the-cuff Method 2, but TED is both <em>far </em>higher stakes than normal and has a strict 14-minute time limit<a href=\"#footnote-2-4737\" id=\"note-2-4737\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a>—meaning you need to be ultra concise and make every word count—so no way I was risking it with Method 2. I was scripting it and going to Happy Birthday land. I found that 90% of other TED speakers do the same thing.</p><p>This was gonna be a huge project.</p><p>Luckily for August Tim, none of this was his problem. He had an all-star team of employees to carry everything out.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Aug-Tim-instructions-1-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment

This wasn’t good. With only about a month to go till the talk and a scary rehearsal in front of the TED staff only days away, I was way behind. When it came time for the rehearsal, I had gotten a loose script together, but I wasn’t sure if I liked it.</p><p>The rehearsal took place in the TED office in New York, in front of a friendly but intimidating semi-circle of TED senior staff.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4762\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4762\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png\" alt=\"Rehearsal 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-300x209.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-768x534.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-600x417.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png 1946w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>I went through what I had, and it went okay until the last five minutes of the talk. I really didn’t like that part of the script, and during the rehearsal, I made the impromptu decision to go rogue and improvise, since I hated what was coming out of my mouth. This was a bad idea. What I ended up doing was a rambling and nonsensical ending that wasn’t that different from me picking words out of the dictionary at random and saying them.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4763\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4763\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-2.png\" alt=\"Rehearsal 2\" width=\"600\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-2-300x262.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-2-768x671.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-2-600x524.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-2.png 1946w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>There was a lot of work to do.</p><p>That night, the head of TED, Chris Anderson, hosted a dinner at his New York apartment for the speakers who were in town for rehearsals.

So much better that he didn’t do that much for the rest of the month.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4782\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4782\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1.jpg\" alt=\"Feb 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1-768x384.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1-600x300.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1.jpg 1946w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>February Tim entered the world furious at every one of his co-workers. But he had no time to be angry—he had to work, every day, all day, immediately. And he did work, a lot, on the first 10 minutes of the talk—the part that was already in pretty good shape. That’s what procrastinators do.</p><p>On February 12th, four days before my talk, I flew to Vancouver, still not fully scripted. I got to my hotel and looked out the window, and there it was:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4814\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4814\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg\" alt=\"confrence\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-300x169.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-768x432.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-600x338.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg 2208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>All TED speakers do a fully mic’ed dress rehearsal on the real stage the weekend before the conference starts. Mine was three days before my talk—and it was pretty rough, confirming to me and everyone present that I was officially not a fraud when it came to my topic. The irony of a guy rehearsing his TED Talk about how he’s a bad procrastinator, and being clearly underprepared while doing so, was not lost on anyone.</p><p>At that point, the first 10 minutes of the talk was here:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4785\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4785\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-300x160.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-768x410.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-600x320.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-374x200.jpg 374w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>Not ideal, but with a lot of reps over the next three days, it was manageable.

He was speaking the same day I was, right after me, but as the author of the book <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Qrf1CA\" target=\"_blank\">Give and Take</a></em>, we both knew he had no choice but to be helpful anyway.</p><p>On Monday, the day before my talk, the conference began. There were whispers about who was in attendance for the week. Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. Goldie Hawn and Cher. Tony Hsieh and Travis Kalanick and Chris Sacca and Steve Case and Al Gore. Even Jaden Smith.</p><p><em>Not helpful information.</em></p><p>I spent most of the day in my hotel room, alternating between rewriting the last part of the talk and trying to better memorize the first part. Finally, late that night, I settled on my final script. I liked it. Finally. Only one problem.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4788\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4788\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph 4\" width=\"600\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-300x193.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-768x493.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-600x385.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>Back at 3A with the last part <em>again, </em>this time with only about 16 hours until the talk.</p><p>I woke up the morning of my talk, did some jumping jacks in my hotel room like a psycho, and then spent four hours saying the last part over and over, eventually getting things here:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4789\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4789\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph 5\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-300x159.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-768x407.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-600x318.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>That would have to be good enough—I was out of time. I showed up at the theater the required 90 minutes before my talk for “hair and makeup,” i.e. an upsettingly-friendly lady painting my face with stuff while I engaged in a 10-minute discussion with her about her two cats back at home. Finally free of that, I spent the final hour pacing back and forth and running through the talk in my head, and then, suddenly, I was doing this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4813\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4813\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg\" alt=\"FullSizeRender-3\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-768x576.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-600x450.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg 992w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p><p>I will say this: The TED stage is a weirdly comforting place. It doesn’t feel like you’re in some huge theater—it feels like you’re on some little red circle surrounded by a bunch of friendly, supportive people who want you to succeed. They designed it that way on purpose, and it works. I was less nervous doing the actual talk than I had been in any of the rehearsals.</p><p>And as I made my way through the talk, disaster never struck. I made it through to the end without any major problems.</p><p><em>VICTORY.</em></p><p>When I was done, I sat in a seat they had reserved for me, blacked out, and watched the next series of talks. Immense relief.</p><p>The week then turned from what I had openly declared to be the worst week of my life into the best possible shit ever. I never knew much about the TED conference before, but it’s <em>very, very fun</em>. It’s like a little luxury playland where super fancy people come to relax and watch 70 <em>intensely </em>stressed-out, less fancy people get on stage, one by one, and say something interesting. And you know when you’re in a store and there’s some incredibly expensive package of high-end beef jerky or some $9 peanut butter cups by some weeping Brooklyn brand or some pixie bottle of juice that amounts to $6/sip and you don’t buy those things cause who has the nerve to actually live like that? Well all that shit is <em>everywhere </em>on these <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">racks</a> as you walk around TED, and it’s all <em>free</em>. I was chewing for 93% of my waking time the rest of the week.</p><p>I’d head into the theater in the morning, some ultra-organic, hyper-cleansing coconut chips in one hand, some wheatgrass extract thing in the other, a thermos full of coffee that took nine minutes for some guy to make using a bunch of test tubes resting in the pocket of the hoodie I wore all week because once your talk is done, literally nothing in the world matters anymore—and I’d plant myself in a seat in the theater and think, “I’m ready, speakers, for you to <em>entertain and educate me</em>. Let’s begin!”</p><p>There’s only one stage and only one talk going on at a time, and that talk, in addition to happening live in the theater, is beamed through the entire conference center, which is full of screens and speakers. So sometimes, instead of watching talks in the theater, I’d watch in one of the many cozy simulcast viewing areas—maybe while lying on one of the hundreds of beanbags. Maybe while stretched out on grass under a tree.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4812\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4812\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4.jpg\" alt=\"FullSizeRender-4\" width=\"657\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4-300x169.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4-768x432.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4-600x338.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4.jpg 2208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\" /></a></p><p>Or maybe in a <em>plastic ball pit</em>.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4811\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4811\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg\" alt=\"FullSizeRender-5\" width=\"550\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-225x300.jpg 225w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-450x600.jpg 450w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg 3024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p><p>Glorious.</p><p>Then it ended and I went home and everything costs money again and I have to do stuff again. Upsetting.</p><p>Anyway, that was my TED experience. To all those scared public speakers out there, I’d just say: the fear and dread of public speaking is almost always much worse than the actual experience of doing it. Everyone is just as uncomfortable with it as you are, and if you just put in a good amount of preparation, it almost always ends up going just fine. And then you’ll be really happy you went through all the hell leading up to it.

") (content:encoded nil "<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard this Seinfeld joke:</p><p><em>According to most studies, people&#8217;s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you&#8217;re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy.</em></p><p>Knowing humans, this shouldn&#8217;t be that surprising. I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\">before</a> that we all have this problem where we&#8217;re weirdly obsessed with what other people think of us, so it makes sense that public speaking should be our collective phobia.</p><p>But then we also live in a world where public speaking can happen to any of us at any time. Even if you never give an official &#8220;talk,&#8221; there&#8217;ll be some other time when you have to give a big toast at a wedding or present in front of a big group at work or speak at a funeral or some other ceremony. Very few of us are safe.</p><p>Over the last couple years, as I&#8217;ve done a small amount of Wait But Why-related public speaking, I&#8217;ve been able to slowly get over the fear. I&#8217;ve learned that if you just be yourself and talk like you normally do, it&#8217;s usually received well by the audience, even if you&#8217;re clearly nervous.</p><p>And that was all fine until August of 2015, when I was invited to do a TED Talk.</p><p>The issue is, a TED Talk is not a speaking gig. In a speaking gig, I stand in front of a group of people and say stuff. That&#8217;s not what a TED Talk is. A TED Talk is a widely-distributed short film, except the only actor is my face and the only plot is me saying words out of my face and the only choreographer is my nervous pacing and awkward arm-flailing, and instead of a bunch of cuts and different shots and a long editing process, there&#8217;s just one do-or-die take, with no second chances.</p><p>No, what? No. Obviously not. Who would <em>ever </em>agree to do something like that.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the problem: Who turns down TED? Not really an option, right? Let&#8217;s pause to go through some background:</p><p>TED actually started way back in 1984, founded by <a href=\"https://www.nantucketproject.com/idea-films/rsw\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Saul Wurman</a>, as a small, Silicon Valley annual gathering. The name is an acronym for Wurman&#8217;s intention for the focus of the conference: Technology, Entertainment, Design. Through the 1990s, the conference grew both in attendance and in the scope of its topics.</p><p>In 2002, media entrepreneur Chris Anderson bought TED from Wurman (through a non-profit he owns) and has run it ever since. He broadened TED&#8217;s content focus to &#8220;ideas worth spreading,&#8221; and in 2006, TED began doing something that would launch the brand into the stratosphere—they put the talks online.</p><p>I first heard of TED in 2008, when someone sent me Jill Bolte Taylor&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">amazing talk</a> about what she learned from the experience of having a stroke. You probably first heard of TED around the same time. And a few years later, almost everyone knew what a TED Talk was. Anderson describes TED&#8217;s rise to global prominence like this:</p><p><em>It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it’s about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as &#8220;ideas worth spreading,&#8221; building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.</em><a href=\"#footnote2-1-4737\" id=\"note2-1-4737\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a><p>The TED brand has expanded in a lot of ways, but maybe most notably through TEDx conferences. This can be a little confusing, so here&#8217;s the deal: There&#8217;s still one annual TED conference, a week-long event in Vancouver, and it&#8217;s run by the TED staff. A TEDx conference is independently run, but it has to follow a set of guidelines laid out by TED so that it fits with the overall brand. There are now over 1,500 annual TEDx events that happen in over 130 countries, some of them major, high-profile conferences;<a href=\"#footnote-1-4737\" id=\"note-1-4737\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> others tiny and little-known. The best TEDx talks are posted on TED.com, alongside the talks that happen at the main conference in Vancouver.</p><p>The thing I was asked to speak at was the big Vancouver one. I say this not only to brag, but also to explain why this whole thing had me freaking out so much. The same thing that made it extra extra scary also made it extra extra not turn-downable.</p><p>So I accepted.</p><p>As I thought through what I had just committed myself to, I identified a number of concerns, like me not having a topic, or the fact that TED Talks are short and narrow and I tend to be the opposite. But perhaps most worrying was the prospect of this being an Exact Script situation. Let me explain (if you&#8217;d rather just read the rest of my TED story, skip down to the comic)—</p><p>When you speak in public, you have three main options about how to go about it, and they fall along a spectrum:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4749\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4749\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png\" alt=\"Prep Spectrum 1\" width=\"653\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-300x95.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-768x244.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3-600x191.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-1-3.png 1574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" /></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>1) Wing it</strong></span></p><p>At the cockiest end of the spectrum, you have the option of completely winging it. This involves no planning—you just get up there and figure out what you want to say once you&#8217;re talking. You be yourself and let the moment carry you.</p><p>This takes some hardcore self-confidence, and it only works if you&#8217;re <em>really </em>good, and if you&#8217;re in the right mood and in front of the right crowd. It&#8217;s a really great way to do a really bad talk, and should probably be kept to super-casual things like impromptu dinner toasts.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>2) Talk through a set structure</strong></span></p><p>Here, you have a clear structure in your head or a list of bullet points on a notecard, and then you simply talk through it. But importantly, you haven&#8217;t scripted sentences exactly—if you did the talk five times, it would come out differently each time, but the general content would be the same. To do this, you have to be super comfortable with the content of what you want to say.</p><p>When you use this method, you come off like a human, because you&#8217;re actually coming up with real sentences as you go, which is how a normal person talks. Your brain is focused on the content of what you&#8217;re saying, and your words are emerging directly from your current thoughts.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t an exact point on the spectrum but a range. On the left side of the range, closer to the winging it end, you have a few general bullets or slides, but you&#8217;ve planned almost nothing beyond that. Toward the right side, you&#8217;ve planned out almost exactly what you want to say, including the placement and wording of certain jokes or other key sentences, but it still comes out a little differently each time you do it.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3) Follow an exact script</strong></span></p><p>Here, on the other extreme end of the spectrum, you write the exact script of the talk ahead of time and deliver the talk on script, word for word. Some people might immediately assume this method will make a talk impersonal and robotic, but it&#8217;s more complicated than that—the exact script method has its own spectrum:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4747\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4747\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png\" alt=\"Prep Spectrum 2\" width=\"700\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-300x112.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-768x288.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2-600x225.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Prep-Spectrum-2.png 2028w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3A) Read off a script</strong></span></p><p>This is simple: You write a script, and the talk is you reading it out loud. During the talk, you&#8217;re just acting as the messenger—you&#8217;re a functional medium connecting the thoughts of your past self to the present audience.</p><p>This is the safest and least stressful way to give a talk and it usually puts the audience to sleep, regardless of how good the content is. Audiences have a fine-tuned radar for when they&#8217;re listening to a person say something versus when they&#8217;re listening to a person <em>recite</em> something—in the latter case, the speaker isn&#8217;t really <em>there </em>in the room with the audience, which has a way of making everyone <em>really</em> want to start playing with their phone.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3B) <strong>Just barely memorized</strong></strong></span></p><p>As you move along the scripted spectrum from 3A to 3B, you go from entirely reading, to reading mostly but with some looks up at the audience, to mostly looking up at the audience with some glances down to the paper, to totally memorized with no paper in hand.</p><p>A paperless 3B speaker won&#8217;t come off much different than a 3A speaker. The 3B speaker isn&#8217;t technically reading off of a script, but he might as well be. Because his memorization of the script is fragile, his mind isn&#8217;t focused on the content of what he&#8217;s saying—it&#8217;s focused on reciting the words he memorized. He&#8217;ll struggle to make eye contact, and his sentences will come off just robotic enough to make the audience clear that he&#8217;s a mostly-unthinking messenger of a written script. Phones will be reached for.</p><p>The main difference is that while 3A is the safest method of all, 3B is the riskiest. Going for it without the paper when you only barely have the talk memorized is a great way to disastrously go blank mid-talk.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>3C) Happy-Birthday-level memorized</strong></span></p><p>When you get to 3C, you don&#8217;t just have the script memorized, you have it memorized <em>cold</em>. And that&#8217;s a <em>key </em>distinction. If you&#8217;re in a restaurant and your table starts singing Happy Birthday to someone you&#8217;re with, you can join in with them even if you&#8217;re simultaneously taking a picture of the birthday girl, moving some stuff out of the way so the waiter has a place on the table to put the cake, observing the other people in the restaurant looking over and wishing this wasn&#8217;t happening, and four other things. It&#8217;s no problem—you can still sing the lyrics. You can do that because the lyrics to Happy Birthday aren&#8217;t coming out of your conscious mind—they&#8217;re coming out of your subconscious. They&#8217;re coming out automatically, and your conscious mind can focus entirely on other things while you&#8217;re singing.</p><p>That&#8217;s how well-memorized 3C is.</p><p>The people at TED refer to two tests you need to pass to qualify as Happy-Birthday-level memorized:</p><ol><li>If you record yourself saying the talk and play it back at 2x speed, can you say it out loud while it&#8217;s playing and stay <em>ahead </em>of the recording?</li><li>Can you recite the talk with no problem while simultaneously doing an unrelated task that requires attention, like following a recipe and measuring out the ingredients into a bowl?</li></ol><p>Memorizing something to this degree might seem like a daunting task, but everyone who&#8217;s ever acted in a play has done it. It&#8217;s not as impossible as it sounds, because the human brain is able to engrave things to that level if you just rehearse enough and sleep on it enough times.</p><p>When a speaker has memorized their talk to this extent, they <em>can </em>be in the room with the audience, even though they&#8217;re reciting a previously-written script, because their conscious mind is freed up to <em>think</em> about what they&#8217;re saying instead of tied up with the task of remembering which line comes next. This allows the speaker to make eye contact and to bring their live personality into the picture to reflect the words being said in real time.</p><p>I&#8217;d sum up the pros and cons of the five options like this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4833\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4833\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2.png\" alt=\"Method graph\" width=\"700\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2-300x263.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2-768x672.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2-600x525.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Method-graph-2.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p><p>On this chart, all three items in the key are bad. Those are the three things that can suck about public speaking. So high-up dots are bad. Looking at this chart, here are some conclusions:</p><ul><li>If and only if the talk is super low-stakes—like an impromptu toast at a group dinner—winging it is a good option. It&#8217;s the only method that takes no prep, and it&#8217;s also the least robotic, which is perfect in casual situations where seeming like you prepped is awkward. But unless you&#8217;re very rad, winging a big talk is a bad idea.</li></ul><ul><li>Method 2 is the best overall choice much of the time, scoring well on all three criteria. It&#8217;s not that hard to prep for, you sound like a human, and it isn&#8217;t that stressful because with nothing to memorize, there&#8217;s nothing to forget, so if you know your material well and you&#8217;re feeling confident, things will go fine. The worst case scenario is that you lose your confidence during the talk and flounder through it. That&#8217;s a bad outcome, but it&#8217;s not a disaster. But Method 2 does require you to be calm and collected, so if you&#8217;re really scared of public speaking, it&#8217;s probably not the way to go. It also leaves you open to variability—depending on how the words come out, you might deliver a better or worse talk—so if the stakes are <em>super </em>high, it&#8217;s not a great option unless you&#8217;re a seasoned pro.</li></ul><ul><li>Method 3A—reading off a script—is a pretty bad option, with one huge plus: It&#8217;s the least scary by far. For people who are <em>terrified </em>of public speaking, they may just want to cling to Method 3A&#8217;s leg and call it a day. But the safety comes at a high cost, in that you&#8217;re leaving yourself with almost no chance of delivering a great talk and a high chance of having the audience tune out. It should be noted that in certain high-gravitas situations, when it&#8217;s more of an official <em>speech </em>than a talk, the clearly-recited tone of a read speech can be appropriate, and even desired—like a graduation speech. In other cases, someone can be skilled enough at reading a script that they can do so in a human-seeming way. Obama is a good example—you often forget that he&#8217;s reading from a teleprompter most of the time you see him talk. But very few of us find ourselves involved with graduation speeches or teleprompters.</li></ul><ul><li>Method 3B—being memorized but just barely—is the worst of all worlds and should never happen. Never ever. If you&#8217;re at 3A and you decide to venture into memorization land and ditch the paper, you better be prepared to put in the time to get all the way to 3C, because here&#8217;s the deal: <img class=\"wp-image-4752 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph.png\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph\" width=\"615\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-300x160.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-768x410.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-600x320.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-374x200.png 374w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph.png 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" />Even if you feel like you have things memorized when you&#8217;re alone in your house, once you&#8217;re in front of the audience, all of these new factors come into play. Your adrenaline is pumping and super-charging your muscles, your nerves take a shit, and a million new things enter your consciousness—the faces of the audience, the clock ticking down with your time limit, your self-awareness of how you&#8217;re standing and what you&#8217;re doing with your hands, your regret over messing up a sentence 30 seconds ago. And that well-memorized talk is suddenly not coming to you so easily. 3B is all of the robotic-ness of 3A with none of the safety. Avoid.</li></ul><ul><li>When the stakes are high and you want to deliver your best talk—but you&#8217;re not a seasoned pro who can pull off Method 2—you&#8217;re left with only one option: 3C. You have to write a great script and memorize it <em>cold</em>. 3C gives everyone an option of basically <em>ensuring</em> that you give a great talk, with relatively low risk. You only have to do one thing: spend eternity prepping. 3C takes <em>forever</em>. Writing a great script means working on it a ton and carefully honing every sentence, and memorizing it to Happy Birthday level takes a huge amount more time. You&#8217;re essentially writing a play, casting yourself, and then learning the part well enough to act it on a stage with no fear of forgetting your lines. Preparing to this level is a nightmare—but if the stakes are high enough, it&#8217;s worth the time.</li></ul><ul><li>A quick note on wedding speeches. The best wedding speeches are usually Method 2 speeches, but most people are too scared to do that. But because they also don&#8217;t want to put <em>that </em>much effort into a wedding speech, most wedding speeches end up in 3A and 3B territory—which is why they&#8217;re usually pretty lame and boring and come along with a buzz of people quietly talking at the tables in the back. If you&#8217;re asked to give a wedding speech, don&#8217;t be a dick—it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s wedding. Either gather the guts to speak from the heart and go with Method 2, or put in the time it takes to get to 3C.</li></ul><p>Back to my situation. Over the past couple years, I had begun to find a groove doing not-that-high-stakes 30-to-60-minute talks using the off-the-cuff Method 2, but TED is both <em>far </em>higher stakes than normal and has a strict 14-minute time limit<a href=\"#footnote-2-4737\" id=\"note-2-4737\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a>—meaning you need to be ultra concise and make every word count—so no way I was risking it with Method 2. I was scripting it and going to Happy Birthday land. I found that 90% of other TED speakers do the same thing.</p><p>This was gonna be a huge project.</p><p>Luckily for August Tim, none of this was his problem. He had an all-star team of employees to carry everything out.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Aug-Tim-instructions-1-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment

This wasn&#8217;t good. With only about a month to go till the talk and a scary rehearsal in front of the TED staff only days away, I was way behind. When it came time for the rehearsal, I had gotten a loose script together, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked it.</p><p>The rehearsal took place in the TED office in New York, in front of a friendly but intimidating semi-circle of TED senior staff.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4762\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4762\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png\" alt=\"Rehearsal 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-300x209.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-768x534.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1-600x417.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rehearsal-1.png 1946w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>I went through what I had, and it went okay until the last five minutes of the talk. I really didn&#8217;t like that part of the script, and during the rehearsal, I made the impromptu decision to go rogue and improvise, since I hated what was coming out of my mouth.

But the dinner ended up making me feel better. It turns out that even rad people are terrified to do a TED Talk. And by the end, most people had admitted that they felt totally unqualified to be involved in this. Everyone else was going through the same thing I was.</p><p>January Tim felt better. So much better that he didn&#8217;t do that much for the rest of the month.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4782\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4782\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1.jpg\" alt=\"Feb 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1-768x384.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1-600x300.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Feb-1.jpg 1946w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>February Tim entered the world furious at every one of his co-workers. But he had no time to be angry—he had to work, every day, all day, immediately. And he did work, a lot, on the first 10 minutes of the talk—the part that was already in pretty good shape. That&#8217;s what procrastinators do.</p><p>On February 12th, four days before my talk, I flew to Vancouver, still not fully scripted. I got to my hotel and looked out the window, and there it was:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4814\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4814\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg\" alt=\"confrence\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-300x169.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-768x432.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence-600x338.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/confrence.jpg 2208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>All TED speakers do a fully mic&#8217;ed dress rehearsal on the real stage the weekend before the conference starts. Mine was three days before my talk—and it was pretty rough, confirming to me and everyone present that I was officially not a fraud when it came to my topic. The irony of a guy rehearsing his TED Talk about how he&#8217;s a bad procrastinator, and being clearly underprepared while doing so, was not lost on anyone.</p><p>At that point, the first 10 minutes of the talk was here:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4785\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4785\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph 1\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-300x160.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-768x410.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-600x320.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1-374x200.jpg 374w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-1.jpg 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>Not ideal, but with a lot of reps over the next three days, it was manageable.

He was speaking the same day I was, right after me, but as the author of the book <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Qrf1CA\" target=\"_blank\">Give and Take</a></em>, we both knew he had no choice but to be helpful anyway.</p><p>On Monday, the day before my talk, the conference began. There were whispers about who was in attendance for the week. Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. Goldie Hawn and Cher. Tony Hsieh and Travis Kalanick and Chris Sacca and Steve Case and Al Gore. Even Jaden Smith.</p><p><em>Not helpful information.</em></p><p>I spent most of the day in my hotel room, alternating between rewriting the last part of the talk and trying to better memorize the first part. Finally, late that night, I settled on my final script. I liked it. Finally. Only one problem.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4788\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4788\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph 4\" width=\"600\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-300x193.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-768x493.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4-600x385.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-4.jpg 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>Back at 3A with the last part <em>again, </em>this time with only about 16 hours until the talk.</p><p>I woke up the morning of my talk, did some jumping jacks in my hotel room like a psycho, and then spent four hours saying the last part over and over, eventually getting things here:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4789\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4789\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg\" alt=\"Memorization risk graph 5\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-300x159.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-768x407.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5-600x318.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Memorization-risk-graph-5.jpg 1870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p><p>That would have to be good enough—I was out of time. I showed up at the theater the required 90 minutes before my talk for &#8220;hair and makeup,&#8221; i.e. an upsettingly-friendly lady painting my face with stuff while I engaged in a 10-minute discussion with her about her two cats back at home. Finally free of that, I spent the final hour pacing back and forth and running through the talk in my head, and then, suddenly, I was doing this:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4813\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4813\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg\" alt=\"FullSizeRender-3\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-768x576.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3-600x450.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-3.jpg 992w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p><p>I will say this: The TED stage is a weirdly comforting place. It doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re in some huge theater—it feels like you&#8217;re on some little red circle surrounded by a bunch of friendly, supportive people who want you to succeed. They designed it that way on purpose, and it works. I was less nervous doing the actual talk than I had been in any of the rehearsals.</p><p>And as I made my way through the talk, disaster never struck. I made it through to the end without any major problems.</p><p><em>VICTORY.</em></p><p>When I was done, I sat in a seat they had reserved for me, blacked out, and watched the next series of talks. Immense relief.</p><p>The week then turned from what I had openly declared to be the worst week of my life into the best possible shit ever. I never knew much about the TED conference before, but it&#8217;s <em>very, very fun</em>. It&#8217;s like a little luxury playland where super fancy people come to relax and watch 70 <em>intensely </em>stressed-out, less fancy people get on stage, one by one, and say something interesting. And you know when you&#8217;re in a store and there&#8217;s some incredibly expensive package of high-end beef jerky or some $9 peanut butter cups by some weeping Brooklyn brand or some pixie bottle of juice that amounts to $6/sip and you don&#8217;t buy those things cause who has the nerve to actually live like that? Well all that shit is <em>everywhere </em>on these <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">racks</a> as you walk around TED, and it&#8217;s all <em>free</em>. I was chewing for 93% of my waking time the rest of the week.</p><p>I&#8217;d head into the theater in the morning, some ultra-organic, hyper-cleansing coconut chips in one hand, some wheatgrass extract thing in the other, a thermos full of coffee that took nine minutes for some guy to make using a bunch of test tubes resting in the pocket of the hoodie I wore all week because once your talk is done, literally nothing in the world matters anymore—and I&#8217;d plant myself in a seat in the theater and think, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready, speakers, for you to <em>entertain and educate me</em>. Let&#8217;s begin!&#8221;</p><p>There&#8217;s only one stage and only one talk going on at a time, and that talk, in addition to happening live in the theater, is beamed through the entire conference center, which is full of screens and speakers. So sometimes, instead of watching talks in the theater, I&#8217;d watch in one of the many cozy simulcast viewing areas—maybe while lying on one of the hundreds of beanbags. Maybe while stretched out on grass under a tree.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4812\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4812\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4.jpg\" alt=\"FullSizeRender-4\" width=\"657\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4-300x169.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4-768x432.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4-600x338.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-4.jpg 2208w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\" /></a></p><p>Or maybe in a <em>plastic ball pit</em>.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4811\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4811\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg\" alt=\"FullSizeRender-5\" width=\"550\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-225x300.jpg 225w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5-450x600.jpg 450w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-5.jpg 3024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p><p>Glorious.</p><p>Then it ended and I went home and everything costs money again and I have to do stuff again. Upsetting.</p><p>Anyway, that was my TED experience. To all those scared public speakers out there, I&#8217;d just say: the fear and dread of public speaking is almost always much worse than the actual experience of doing it. Everyone is just as uncomfortable with it as you are, and if you just put in a good amount of preparation, it almost always ends up going just fine. And then you&#8217;ll be really happy you went through all the hell leading up to it.

") (wfw:commentRss nil "http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html/feed") (slash:comments nil "0"))) ("Horizontal History" "<p>Most of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers, parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our lives. Without a foundational, tree-trunk understanding of all parts of history, we often forget the things we do learn, leaving even our favorite parts of history a bit hazy in our heads. Raise your hand if you’d like to go on stage and debate a history buff on the nuances of a historical time period of your choosing. That’s what I thought.</p><p>The reason history is so hard is that it’s so <em>soft</em>. To truly, fully understand a time period, an event, a movement, or an important historical figure, you’d have to be there, and many times over. You’d have to be in the homes of the public living at the time to hear what they’re saying; you’d have to be a fly on the wall in dozens of secret, closed-door meetings and conversations; you’d need to be inside the minds of the key players to know their innermost thoughts and motivations. Even then, you’d be lacking context. To really have the complete truth, you’d need background—the cultural nuances and national psyches of the time, the way each of the key players was raised during childhood and the subtle social dynamics between those players, the impact of what was going on in other parts of the world, and an equally-thorough understanding of the many past centuries that all of these things grew out of.</p><p>That’s why not only can’t even the most perfect history buff fully understand history, but the key people involved <em>at the time</em> can’t ever know the full story. History is a giant collective tangle of thousands of interwoven stories involving millions of characters, countless chapters, and many, many narrators.</p><p>And you know humans—that’s not how they like things. The human brain really, really likes to <em>simplify </em>things. History provides the context of our world and our lives, because each of us is a character in this grand story—and the last thing we want to believe is that the story is too complicated and mysterious for us to understand.</p><p>Fairy tales are satisfying, because the plot is crystal clear—there are good guys and there are bad guys and there’s only one side of the story. Children identify with the good guys—the <em>us </em>guys—and they detest the bad guys—the <em>them</em> guys<em>—</em>and everyone’s happy. Stories written for adults aren’t that different—you loved <em>Shawshank </em>and <em>Braveheart</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>, right?</p><p>So when it comes to the story we’re all a <em>part </em>of, we most certainly want to feel the same way. We want history to be simple and clear, with good guys and bad guys, and we’d like to make sure that our ancestors, our ethnic group, our nation, and all the other tribes we belong to are Aladdin in the story—not Jafar.</p><p>The problem with this is that not everyone can be Aladdin. <em>Someone </em>has to be Jafar, right? Well, no. Not if there are many different story-tellers. Since no one is ever telling anything close to the full, real, <em>complete </em>story, in all its complexity—as we said, no one even <em>knows </em>the full story—each historian, each ruler, and each society creates their own fairy tale version of what went down in the past. When things are unsatisfyingly multi-faceted, we pick the facet we like best. When there are knowledge gaps, we make things up. When there are questions of motive, we pick one that fits nicely into the narrative.</p><p>This leaves us with plenty of tools to leave every story with a proper Aladdin and a proper Jafar and allows us to make sure that Aladdin is exactly who we want him to be.</p><p>The US is a good example. A huge number of people in today’s world have been told a story of the US in which the US is Aladdin, and a huge other number of people have heard the same story with the US as Jafar. Some people will claim to have a more nuanced view, but deep in their heart, when they see an American flag, they see either a good guy flag or a bad guy flag. (One of the major political divides in the US stems from liberals thinking conservatives over-Aladdinize the US and conservatives thinking liberals over-Jafarify the US while Aladdinizing the other side.)</p><p>This is the same phenomenon behind the stark opinion divide around Israel and Palestine. Hoards of people on both sides of what is an <em>insanely</em> complicated story are red in the face with ire at the other side, completely positive that their side is Aladdin and incensed that anyone could ever call the other side Aladdin and their side Jafar. Only with the stark clarity of a fairy tale could people ever feel so unshakingly sure.</p><p>Of course, it’s not that there are no good guys or bad guys in history. History is a pretty ugly story—what else would you expect from a species of primitive biological animals—and accountability for that ugliness isn’t spread out evenly amongst all people. To an extent, the definition of words like good and bad, right and wrong, and hero and villain lie in the eye of the beholder—but there’s also plenty of human behavior that qualifies as objectively good or bad.</p><p>So it’s not that there are never objective Aladdins and there are never objective Jafars—it’s that almost none of us has any idea what the fuck we’re talking about. Point to a historical event and tell me that there was a true Aladdin and Jafar going on, and I’ll acknowledge that that might be true. Tell me that you know who was who, and in most cases I’ll shake my head.</p><p>Which brings me to me. Blogging about history is asking for trouble. Portray nearly any story or person as an Aladdin or a Jafar and you’ll feel the wrath of both the people who believe the opposite situation and the people who think you’ve oversimplified the situation. Portray something in a nuanced and balanced way and you’ll get yelled at by people who believe <em>both</em> of the one-sided views. Nothing brings people’s tribal fires to the table like history. I’ve learned this <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">from</a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/absurdly-famous-people-probably-dont-know-enough.html\" target=\"_blank\">experience</a>.</p><p>This doesn’t make me any less excited to write about history—but it makes me want to research the shit out of a part of history before I write about it. Only by reading a bunch of varying accounts and opinions can you start to form a clear picture of what we know and don’t know.</p><p>So that’s why for this post, I’m not gonna tell you shit. Rather than dive into the weeds of what happened when, and why, I’m going to focus on one of the rare elements of history that’s indisputably black-and-white—<em>who </em>happened when.</p><p>Because before we can responsibly start arguing with each other about Aladdins and Jafars, we need to get the basic timeline and characters of the story clear.</p><p>But I’m going to lay things out a little differently than you’re probably used to.</p><p>Normally, we learn about history’s storylines in isolation. We might have a strong sense of the history of physics breakthroughs or the progression of western philosophical thought or the succession of French rulers—but we’re not as clear on how each of these storylines relate to each <em>other</em>. If you think of history like a tangle of vines growing upwards through time, studying one type of history at a time is like following the path of one particular vine while ignoring the other vines around it. It’s understanding history in a <em>vertical </em>sense.</p><p>And while vertical history has its merits, it doesn’t leave you with an especially <em>complete</em> picture of any one time. An econ buff in the year 2500 might know all about the Great Depression that happened in the early 20th century and the major recession that happened about 80 years later, but that same person might mistake the two world wars for happening in the 1800s or the 2200s if they’re a little hazy on the history of wars. So while an econ buff, that person would have a pretty poor understanding of what our modern times are all <em>about. </em></p><p>Likewise, I might know that Copernicus began writing his seminal work <i>On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres </i>in Poland in the early 1510s, but by learning that right around that same time in Italy, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, I get a better picture of the <em>times</em>. By learning that it was right while both of these things were happening that Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in England, the 1510s suddenly begins to take on a distinct <em>personality</em>. These three facts, when put together, allow me to see a more three-dimensional picture of the 1510s—it allows me to see the 1510s <em>horizontally</em>, like cutting out a complete segment of the vine tangle and examining it all together.</p><p>A blog post is limited in its ability to examine all of history horizontally. But I’ve taken two separate cracks below that I think can work together nicely to help us take a horizontal view of different times. Both involve a lot of names.</p><p>Which leads me to the inevitable disclaimer about <em>who </em>I chose to include. I tried to remove my own biases by gathering the names from a handful of lists by publications like <em>Time</em>. I searched the internet for things like “most influential people in history” and “most important people in the Middle Ages” and “most famous people of the 19th century” and “most powerful Chinese emperors” and ended up with a big pile of names, some of whom I’m familiar with, others I’m not. That said, between the fact that the lists I used were by publications targeting English-speaking people and that I inevitably leaned more towards people I had heard of, the group of names will skew America- and Euro-centric, with places like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia probably underrepresented. This isn’t entirely by accident, though—this post is only useful if you’ve heard of the people, and I intentionally chose names I thought a large portion of Wait But Why readers would know. In other words, merit wasn’t the only criteria—household fame mattered too. And yes, I missed a lot of people—with limited space on the screen, the names had to be a sampling, not an exhaustive list.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Horizontal History—First Crack:</strong></span></p><p>For my first crack, I present to you a big pile of famous names, organized by birth decade—kind of a “2,600 Under 2,600” list. The purpose is to help orient ourselves on when people lived, especially <em>in relation to each other</em>.</p><p>Having a clear picture of generations is very easy when you think about currently-living people. For example, I know that Mark Zuckerberg is around my age while Vladimir Putin is about the age of my parents and George H.W. Bush is about the age of my grandparents. On the other side of things, Prince George—the one world-famous baby—is the age of my kids if I had kids. I know this without having to think about it:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4675\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4675\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png\" alt=\"My generations\" width=\"460\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-300x125.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-768x320.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-600x250.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png 1542w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /></a></p><p>If I list people by birth decade instead of generation, it still makes sense. People born in the 70s and 60s feel older than me but not as old as my parents, and people born in the 30s and 40s feel older than my parents but younger than my grandparents:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4674\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4674\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png\" alt=\"My generations - decades\" width=\"485\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-300x179.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-768x459.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-600x359.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /></a></p><p>But this is much harder for generations that aren’t currently alive, and it gets less and less clear the farther back you go. Quick! Name the oldest member and youngest member of this group: Nietzsche, Darwin, Freud, Marx, Gandhi, Tolstoy, Twain. Not that easy, right? And that’s only going back 200 years. But by laying them out by birth decade, you can get oriented:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4642\"><img class=\"wp-image-4642 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png\" alt=\"Older decades\" width=\"231\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades-300x296.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px\" /></a></p><p>Since a generation is typically about 30 years, you can move three or six lines down from a name to see who they viewed as their parents’ or grandparents’ ages during their lifetimes, and you can go the same distance up to see who they viewed as their kids’ or grandkids’ age. So Darwin would have seen Twain as some young kid and he would have shaken his old man fist at Gandhi from the rocking chair on his porch. Meanwhile, Nietzsche would have seen Marx as a guy his dad’s age and Freud as a contemporary, though a bit younger.</p><p>Two people more than seven or eight lines away from each other on the list probably were not ever alive at the same time, which means they were likely not that clear about each others’ generation, in the way I’m not really clear on whether Hemingway was in my great-grandparents’ generation, my great-great-grandparents’ generation, or some other age.</p><p>Using this decade list tool, let’s look at a whole group of famous historical figures to see who was the same age as whom, who shook their old man fist at whom, and who was and wasn’t alive at the same time. The decade colors are in a three-way cycle, so you can jump to rows of the same color above and below to quickly go up and down by generations (i.e. if you take a name on a green line, one green line down is their parents’ age, three green lines up is their great-grandchildren’s age, etc.). For people alive today and in the past century, I couldn’t come close to including every famous person, so I just picked a sampling.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4679\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4679\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg\" alt=\"Horizontal History - Generations\" width=\"900\" height=\"3503\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4-768x2989.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg 1336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p><p>Okay how did that go? Fun? Icky? I can’t quite tell. In any case, let’s move on.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Horizontal History—Second Crack:</strong></span></p><p>For my second crack at depicting history horizontally, I present to you A Psychotic Jumble of Colorful Vertical Bars That Might Be Awesome or Maybe Not I Can’t Tell Here Either But I Think It Might Be Fun.</p><p>This time, I got more specific than birth decade and actually identified the exact birth year <em>and </em>the death year of each name, using a bar to depict their lifespan. While the above chart simplifies who lived when, the diagram below allows you to follow a single horizontal path along any year and see who was and wasn’t alive at that time.</p><p>As I made the diagram, I ran into a big problem, which is that it looked like an upside-down L with <em>way </em>more names at the top than the bottom (because there are a lot more household names who were alive in the last 200 years than in previous centuries). Crunching all those recent names into blog width made the font tiny—so I solved the problem by cutting out about half of the recent names. <em>But</em>, before I did, I broke the complete list of 1800–2016 names into two groups by category and here they are below:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4682\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4682\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Horizontal History - Lifespans (Recent 1)\" width=\"900\" height=\"601\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2-768x513.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2-600x401.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2.jpg 1474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4683\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4683\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Horizontal History - Lifespans (Recent 2)\" width=\"900\" height=\"618\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2-300x206.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2-768x527.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2-600x412.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2.jpg 1426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p><p>Okay now that that’s out of the way, here’s the big list (with only half of the total 1800–2016 names included).

<p>Some overall thoughts:</p><ul><li><strong>Lifespans are unfair.</strong> Looking at people’s lives visually really makes it clear when two people are born around the same time but then one of them randomly dies 30 years before the other.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Murder is dickish.</strong> Another thing this diagram highlights. How not okay is it to cut someone <em>else’s </em>bar short? JFK might have been on his way to a nice 85-year bar when this other guy just took a scissors and <em>snipped </em>his bar.</li></ul><ul><li><b>On the other hand, short lives were appreciated during the making of this diagram. </b>This was a nightmare of a puzzle, especially at the top, and while trying to fit a lot of bars into a small space, there were times I found myself saying, out loud, “Oh nice,” when I’d look up someone’s life dates and realize that they were murdered at a young age. Likewise, one factor that led to a number of the recent people being cut from the big diagram was living too long.

Simultaneously, you can see the Protestant Reformation brewing with the presence of all those dark blue religious figures. The one dark blue exception is Guru Nanak, who was over in Asia being the founding prophet of Sikhism (today’s 5th biggest religion). Meanwhile, Michelangelo was part of something larger, as the other pink bars—and Machiavelli—remind us that the Italian Renaissance was in full swing.</p><p>Every time I look at the lifespan diagram, a new interesting horizontal pops out to me. Here’s one more: People in the US associate the 1860s with Lincoln and the Civil War. But what we overlook is that the 1860s was one of history’s greatest literary decades. In the ten years between 1859 and 1869, Darwin published his world-changing <em>On the Origin of Species </em>(1859), Dickens published <em>A Tale of Two Cities </em>(1859) and <em>Great Expectations </em>(1861), Lewis Carroll published <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>(1865), Dostoyevsky published <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1866), and Tolstoy capped things off with <em>War and Peace</em> (1869). These guys were all in their primes <em>at the same time</em>. So was Lincoln, before some cock snipped his bar off at the worst time possible.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4666\"><img class=\"wp-image-4666 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg\" alt=\"1860s\" width=\"192\" height=\"327\" /></a></p><p>So there’s some horizontal history for you.

") (content:encoded nil "<p>Most of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers, parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our lives. Without a foundational, tree-trunk understanding of all parts of history, we often forget the things we do learn, leaving even our favorite parts of history a bit hazy in our heads. Raise your hand if you&#8217;d like to go on stage and debate a history buff on the nuances of a historical time period of your choosing. That&#8217;s what I thought.</p><p>The reason history is so hard is that it&#8217;s so <em>soft</em>. To truly, fully understand a time period, an event, a movement, or an important historical figure, you&#8217;d have to be there, and many times over. You&#8217;d have to be in the homes of the public living at the time to hear what they&#8217;re saying; you&#8217;d have to be a fly on the wall in dozens of secret, closed-door meetings and conversations; you&#8217;d need to be inside the minds of the key players to know their innermost thoughts and motivations. Even then, you&#8217;d be lacking context. To really have the complete truth, you&#8217;d need background—the cultural nuances and national psyches of the time, the way each of the key players was raised during childhood and the subtle social dynamics between those players, the impact of what was going on in other parts of the world, and an equally-thorough understanding of the many past centuries that all of these things grew out of.</p><p>That&#8217;s why not only can&#8217;t even the most perfect history buff fully understand history, but the key people involved <em>at the time</em> can&#8217;t ever know the full story. History is a giant collective tangle of thousands of interwoven stories involving millions of characters, countless chapters, and many, many narrators.</p><p>And you know humans—that&#8217;s not how they like things. The human brain really, really likes to <em>simplify </em>things. History provides the context of our world and our lives, because each of us is a character in this grand story—and the last thing we want to believe is that the story is too complicated and mysterious for us to understand.</p><p>Fairy tales are satisfying, because the plot is crystal clear—there are good guys and there are bad guys and there&#8217;s only one side of the story. Children identify with the good guys—the <em>us </em>guys—and they detest the bad guys—the <em>them</em> guys<em>—</em>and everyone&#8217;s happy. Stories written for adults aren&#8217;t that different—you loved <em>Shawshank </em>and <em>Braveheart</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>, right?</p><p>So when it comes to the story we&#8217;re all a <em>part </em>of, we most certainly want to feel the same way. We want history to be simple and clear, with good guys and bad guys, and we&#8217;d like to make sure that our ancestors, our ethnic group, our nation, and all the other tribes we belong to are Aladdin in the story—not Jafar.</p><p>The problem with this is that not everyone can be Aladdin. <em>Someone </em>has to be Jafar, right? Well, no. Not if there are many different story-tellers. Since no one is ever telling anything close to the full, real, <em>complete </em>story, in all its complexity—as we said, no one even <em>knows </em>the full story—each historian, each ruler, and each society creates their own fairy tale version of what went down in the past. When things are unsatisfyingly multi-faceted, we pick the facet we like best. When there are knowledge gaps, we make things up. When there are questions of motive, we pick one that fits nicely into the narrative.</p><p>This leaves us with plenty of tools to leave every story with a proper Aladdin and a proper Jafar and allows us to make sure that Aladdin is exactly who we want him to be.</p><p>The US is a good example. A huge number of people in today&#8217;s world have been told a story of the US in which the US is Aladdin, and a huge other number of people have heard the same story with the US as Jafar. Some people will claim to have a more nuanced view, but deep in their heart, when they see an American flag, they see either a good guy flag or a bad guy flag. (One of the major political divides in the US stems from liberals thinking conservatives over-Aladdinize the US and conservatives thinking liberals over-Jafarify the US while Aladdinizing the other side.)</p><p>This is the same phenomenon behind the stark opinion divide around Israel and Palestine. Hoards of people on both sides of what is an <em>insanely</em> complicated story are red in the face with ire at the other side, completely positive that their side is Aladdin and incensed that anyone could ever call the other side Aladdin and their side Jafar. Only with the stark clarity of a fairy tale could people ever feel so unshakingly sure.</p><p>Of course, it&#8217;s not that there are no good guys or bad guys in history. History is a pretty ugly story—what else would you expect from a species of primitive biological animals—and accountability for that ugliness isn&#8217;t spread out evenly amongst all people. To an extent, the definition of words like good and bad, right and wrong, and hero and villain lie in the eye of the beholder—but there&#8217;s also plenty of human behavior that qualifies as objectively good or bad.</p><p>So it&#8217;s not that there are never objective Aladdins and there are never objective Jafars—it&#8217;s that almost none of us has any idea what the fuck we&#8217;re talking about. Point to a historical event and tell me that there was a true Aladdin and Jafar going on, and I&#8217;ll acknowledge that that might be true. Tell me that you know who was who, and in most cases I&#8217;ll shake my head.</p><p>Which brings me to me. Blogging about history is asking for trouble. Portray nearly any story or person as an Aladdin or a Jafar and you&#8217;ll feel the wrath of both the people who believe the opposite situation and the people who think you&#8217;ve oversimplified the situation. Portray something in a nuanced and balanced way and you&#8217;ll get yelled at by people who believe <em>both</em> of the one-sided views. Nothing brings people&#8217;s tribal fires to the table like history. I&#8217;ve learned this <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">from</a><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/absurdly-famous-people-probably-dont-know-enough.html\" target=\"_blank\">experience</a>.</p><p>This doesn&#8217;t make me any less excited to write about history—but it makes me want to research the shit out of a part of history before I write about it. Only by reading a bunch of varying accounts and opinions can you start to form a clear picture of what we know and don&#8217;t know.</p><p>So that&#8217;s why for this post, I&#8217;m not gonna tell you shit. Rather than dive into the weeds of what happened when, and why, I&#8217;m going to focus on one of the rare elements of history that&#8217;s indisputably black-and-white—<em>who </em>happened when.</p><p>Because before we can responsibly start arguing with each other about Aladdins and Jafars, we need to get the basic timeline and characters of the story clear.</p><p>But I&#8217;m going to lay things out a little differently than you&#8217;re probably used to.</p><p>Normally, we learn about history&#8217;s storylines in isolation. We might have a strong sense of the history of physics breakthroughs or the progression of western philosophical thought or the succession of French rulers—but we&#8217;re not as clear on how each of these storylines relate to each <em>other</em>. If you think of history like a tangle of vines growing upwards through time, studying one type of history at a time is like following the path of one particular vine while ignoring the other vines around it. It&#8217;s understanding history in a <em>vertical </em>sense.</p><p>And while vertical history has its merits, it doesn&#8217;t leave you with an especially <em>complete</em> picture of any one time. An econ buff in the year 2500 might know all about the Great Depression that happened in the early 20th century and the major recession that happened about 80 years later, but that same person might mistake the two world wars for happening in the 1800s or the 2200s if they&#8217;re a little hazy on the history of wars. So while an econ buff, that person would have a pretty poor understanding of what our modern times are all <em>about. </em></p><p>Likewise, I might know that Copernicus began writing his seminal work <i>On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres </i>in Poland in the early 1510s, but by learning that right around that same time in Italy, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, I get a better picture of the <em>times</em>. By learning that it was right while both of these things were happening that Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon in England, the 1510s suddenly begins to take on a distinct <em>personality</em>. These three facts, when put together, allow me to see a more three-dimensional picture of the 1510s—it allows me to see the 1510s <em>horizontally</em>, like cutting out a complete segment of the vine tangle and examining it all together.</p><p>A blog post is limited in its ability to examine all of history horizontally. But I&#8217;ve taken two separate cracks below that I think can work together nicely to help us take a horizontal view of different times. Both involve a lot of names.</p><p>Which leads me to the inevitable disclaimer about <em>who </em>I chose to include. I tried to remove my own biases by gathering the names from a handful of lists by publications like <em>Time</em>. I searched the internet for things like &#8220;most influential people in history&#8221; and &#8220;most important people in the Middle Ages&#8221; and &#8220;most famous people of the 19th century&#8221; and &#8220;most powerful Chinese emperors&#8221; and ended up with a big pile of names, some of whom I&#8217;m familiar with, others I&#8217;m not. That said, between the fact that the lists I used were by publications targeting English-speaking people and that I inevitably leaned more towards people I had heard of, the group of names will skew America- and Euro-centric, with places like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia probably underrepresented. This isn&#8217;t entirely by accident, though—this post is only useful if you&#8217;ve heard of the people, and I intentionally chose names I thought a large portion of Wait But Why readers would know. In other words, merit wasn&#8217;t the only criteria—household fame mattered too. And yes, I missed a lot of people—with limited space on the screen, the names had to be a sampling, not an exhaustive list.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Horizontal History—First Crack:</strong></span></p><p>For my first crack, I present to you a big pile of famous names, organized by birth decade—kind of a &#8220;2,600 Under 2,600&#8221; list. The purpose is to help orient ourselves on when people lived, especially <em>in relation to each other</em>.</p><p>Having a clear picture of generations is very easy when you think about currently-living people. For example, I know that Mark Zuckerberg is around my age while Vladimir Putin is about the age of my parents and George H.W. Bush is about the age of my grandparents. On the other side of things, Prince George—the one world-famous baby—is the age of my kids if I had kids. I know this without having to think about it:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4675\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4675\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png\" alt=\"My generations\" width=\"460\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-300x125.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-768x320.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-600x250.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations.png 1542w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /></a></p><p>If I list people by birth decade instead of generation, it still makes sense. People born in the 70s and 60s feel older than me but not as old as my parents, and people born in the 30s and 40s feel older than my parents but younger than my grandparents:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4674\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4674\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png\" alt=\"My generations - decades\" width=\"485\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-300x179.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-768x459.png 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades-600x359.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/My-generations-decades.png 1596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /></a></p><p>But this is much harder for generations that aren&#8217;t currently alive, and it gets less and less clear the farther back you go. Quick! Name the oldest member and youngest member of this group: Nietzsche, Darwin, Freud, Marx, Gandhi, Tolstoy, Twain. Not that easy, right? And that&#8217;s only going back 200 years. But by laying them out by birth decade, you can get oriented:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4642\"><img class=\"wp-image-4642 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png\" alt=\"Older decades\" width=\"231\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades-300x296.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Older-decades.png 418w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px\" /></a></p><p>Since a generation is typically about 30 years, you can move three or six lines down from a name to see who they viewed as their parents&#8217; or grandparents&#8217; ages during their lifetimes, and you can go the same distance up to see who they viewed as their kids&#8217; or grandkids&#8217; age. So Darwin would have seen Twain as some young kid and he would have shaken his old man fist at Gandhi from the rocking chair on his porch. Meanwhile, Nietzsche would have seen Marx as a guy his dad&#8217;s age and Freud as a contemporary, though a bit younger.</p><p>Two people more than seven or eight lines away from each other on the list probably were not ever alive at the same time, which means they were likely not that clear about each others&#8217; generation, in the way I&#8217;m not really clear on whether Hemingway was in my great-grandparents&#8217; generation, my great-great-grandparents&#8217; generation, or some other age.</p><p>Using this decade list tool, let&#8217;s look at a whole group of famous historical figures to see who was the same age as whom, who shook their old man fist at whom, and who was and wasn&#8217;t alive at the same time. The decade colors are in a three-way cycle, so you can jump to rows of the same color above and below to quickly go up and down by generations (i.e. if you take a name on a green line, one green line down is their parents&#8217; age, three green lines up is their great-grandchildren&#8217;s age, etc.). For people alive today and in the past century, I couldn&#8217;t come close to including every famous person, so I just picked a sampling.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4679\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4679\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg\" alt=\"Horizontal History - Generations\" width=\"900\" height=\"3503\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4-768x2989.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Generations-4.jpg 1336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p><p>Okay how did that go?

While the above chart simplifies who lived when, the diagram below allows you to follow a single horizontal path along any year and see who was and wasn&#8217;t alive at that time.</p><p>As I made the diagram, I ran into a big problem, which is that it looked like an upside-down L with <em>way </em>more names at the top than the bottom (because there are a lot more household names who were alive in the last 200 years than in previous centuries). Crunching all those recent names into blog width made the font tiny—so I solved the problem by cutting out about half of the recent names. <em>But</em>, before I did, I broke the complete list of 1800–2016 names into two groups by category and here they are below:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4682\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4682\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"Horizontal History - Lifespans (Recent 1)\" width=\"900\" height=\"601\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2-768x513.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2-600x401.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-1-2.jpg 1474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4683\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4683\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"Horizontal History - Lifespans (Recent 2)\" width=\"900\" height=\"618\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2-300x206.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2-768x527.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2-600x412.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Recent-2-2.jpg 1426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p><p>Okay now that that&#8217;s out of the way, here&#8217;s the big list (with only half of the total 1800–2016 names included).

[<strong>Note: </strong>A number of people have requested a sideways version of this diagram. <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Horizontal-History-Lifespans-Sideways.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Here it is.</a>]
<p>Some overall thoughts:</p><ul><li><strong>Lifespans are unfair.</strong> Looking at people&#8217;s lives visually really makes it clear when two people are born around the same time but then one of them randomly dies 30 years before the other.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Murder is dickish.</strong> Another thing this diagram highlights. How not okay is it to cut someone <em>else&#8217;s </em>bar short? JFK might have been on his way to a nice 85-year bar when this other guy just took a scissors and <em>snipped </em>his bar.</li></ul><ul><li><b>On the other hand, short lives were appreciated during the making of this diagram. </b>This was a nightmare of a puzzle, especially at the top, and while trying to fit a lot of bars into a small space, there were times I found myself saying, out loud, &#8220;Oh nice,&#8221; when I&#8217;d look up someone&#8217;s life dates and realize that they were murdered at a young age. Likewise, one factor that led to a number of the recent people being cut from the big diagram was living too long. Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s a cool dude, but not 2.5 inches of diagram cool.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Some people aren&#8217;t easily categorized<em>. </em></strong>I tried my best. You try putting Ben Franklin into a category.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Yeah, yeah, I said the whole &#8220;Aladdin and Jafar are in the eye of the beholder&#8221; thing and then I created a category for people who I deemed dicks.<em> </em></strong>I know. But it was fun to label certain people as dicks. Ya know?</li></ul><p>Each little part of this diagram tells a story. Let&#8217;s go through a few examples:</p><p>I mentioned in a box in the first chart that Mozart wrote his <em>Requiem</em> the same year the US forefathers were writing the Bill of Rights and that Beethoven had a love-hate relationship with Napoleon—but using the lifespan diagram, you can see both of these stories visually.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1780.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4651\"><img class=\"wp-image-4651 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1780.jpg\" alt=\"1780\" width=\"197\" height=\"351\" /></a></p><p>I also mentioned the major Shakespeare, Galileo, Tokugawa, and John Smith events that all happened right around the year 1610.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4686\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4686\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1610.png\" alt=\"1610\" width=\"150\" height=\"329\" /></a></p><p>And in the intro, I referenced Copernicus&#8217;s seminal work happening right when Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling and Henry VIII was marrying Catherine of Aragon.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4685\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4685\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510.png\" alt=\"1510\" width=\"140\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510-130x300.png 130w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510-260x600.png 260w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1510.png 383w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px\" /></a></p><p>But if you look at the other stuff the diagram shows going on around that same time, it tells a bigger story:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4680\"><img class=\"wp-image-4680 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2.jpg\" alt=\"Renaissance\" width=\"479\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2-300x236.jpg 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2-768x604.jpg 768w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2-600x472.jpg 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Renaissance-2.jpg 1494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" /></a></p><p>While Copernicus, Michelangelo, and Henry VIII were happening, it was also the golden age of European exploration—look at all those light purple explorers!—and the precursor age to the oncoming Age of Imperialism. Simultaneously, you can see the Protestant Reformation brewing with the presence of all those dark blue religious figures. The one dark blue exception is Guru Nanak, who was over in Asia being the founding prophet of Sikhism (today&#8217;s 5th biggest religion). Meanwhile, Michelangelo was part of something larger, as the other pink bars—and Machiavelli—remind us that the Italian Renaissance was in full swing.</p><p>Every time I look at the lifespan diagram, a new interesting horizontal pops out to me. Here&#8217;s one more: People in the US associate the 1860s with Lincoln and the Civil War. But what we overlook is that the 1860s was one of history&#8217;s greatest literary decades. In the ten years between 1859 and 1869, Darwin published his world-changing <em>On the Origin of Species </em>(1859), Dickens published <em>A Tale of Two Cities </em>(1859) and <em>Great Expectations </em>(1861), Lewis Carroll published <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>(1865), Dostoyevsky published <em>Crime and Punishment</em> (1866), and Tolstoy capped things off with <em>War and Peace</em> (1869). These guys were all in their primes <em>at the same time</em>. So was Lincoln, before some cock snipped his bar off at the worst time possible.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4666\"><img class=\"wp-image-4666 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1860s-2.jpg\" alt=\"1860s\" width=\"192\" height=\"327\" /></a></p><p>So there&#8217;s some horizontal history for you.

Each of those dots is only a single Tuesday or Friday or Sunday, but even a lucky person who lives to 90 will have no problem fitting every day in their life on <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-90-Year-Life-in-Days.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one sheet of paper</a>.</p><p>But since doing the Life in Weeks post, I’ve been thinking about something else.</p><p>Instead of measuring your life in units of time, you can measure it in activities or events. To use myself as an example:</p><p>I’m 34, so let’s be super optimistic and say I’ll be hanging around drawing stick figures till I’m 90.<a href=\"#footnote-1-4579\" id=\"note-1-4579\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> If so, I have a little under 60 winters left:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4587 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png\" alt=\"Winters\" width=\"345\" height=\"343\" /></a></p><p>And maybe around 60 Superbowls left:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4586 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png\" alt=\"Superbowls\" width=\"383\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls-300x282.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls-600x563.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /></a></p><p>The ocean is freezing and putting my body into it is a bad life experience, so I tend to limit myself to around one ocean swim a year. So as weird as it seems, I might only go in the ocean 60 more times:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4582\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png\" alt=\"Ocean\" width=\"400\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean-300x218.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean-600x436.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p><p>Not counting Wait But Why research, I read about five books a year, so even though it feels like I’ll read an endless number of books in the future, I actually have to choose only 300 of all the books out there to read and accept that I’ll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4580\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png\" alt=\"books\" width=\"524\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books-291x300.png 291w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books-582x600.png 582w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png 1741w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" /></a></p><p>Growing up in Boston, I went to Red Sox games all the time, but if I never move back there, I’ll probably continue at my current rate of going to a Sox game about once every three years—meaning this little row of 20 represents my remaining Fenway visits:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4585 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png\" alt=\"sox\" width=\"693\" height=\"61\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox-300x26.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox-600x53.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png 1893w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" /></a></p><p>There have been eight US presidential elections during my lifetime and about 15 to go. I’ve seen five presidents in office and if that rate continues, I’ll see about nine more.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4584 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png\" alt=\"presidents\" width=\"540\" height=\"68\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents-300x38.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents-600x76.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png 1610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a></p><p>I probably eat pizza about once a month, so I’ve got about 700 more chances to eat pizza. I have an even brighter future with dumplings. I have Chinese food about twice a month and I tend to make sure six dumplings occurs each time, so I have a fuckton of dumplings to look forward to:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dumplings-small.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4581\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dumplings-small.png\" alt=\"dumplings small\" width=\"721\" height=\"1970\" /></a></p><p>But these things aren’t what I’ve been thinking about. Most of the things I just mentioned happen with a similar frequency during each year of my life, which spreads them out somewhat evenly through time. If I’m around a third of my way through life, I’m also about a third of my way through experiencing the activity or event.</p><p>What I’ve been thinking about is a really important part of life that, unlike all of these examples, isn’t spread out evenly through time—something whose [already done / still to come] ratio doesn’t at all align with how far I am through life:</p><p>Relationships.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about my parents, who are in their mid-60s. During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I’ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood.</p><p>Being in their mid-60s, let’s continue to be super optimistic and say I’m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that’s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years.</p><p>When you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I’ll ever spend with each of my parents—assuming I’m as lucky as can be—this becomes starkly clear:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4583\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png\" alt=\"parents small\" width=\"800\" height=\"2071\" /></a></p><p>It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.</p><p>It’s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.</p><p>The same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade.

Each of those dots is only a single Tuesday or Friday or Sunday, but even a lucky person who lives to 90 will have no problem fitting every day in their life on <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-90-Year-Life-in-Days.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">one sheet of paper</a>.</p><p>But since doing the Life in Weeks post, I&#8217;ve been thinking about something else.</p><p>Instead of measuring your life in units of time, you can measure it in activities or events. To use myself as an example:</p><p>I&#8217;m 34, so let&#8217;s be super optimistic and say I&#8217;ll be hanging around drawing stick figures till I&#8217;m 90.<a href=\"#footnote-1-4579\" id=\"note-1-4579\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> If so, I have a little under 60 winters left:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4587 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winters.png\" alt=\"Winters\" width=\"345\" height=\"343\" /></a></p><p>And maybe around 60 Superbowls left:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4586 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png\" alt=\"Superbowls\" width=\"383\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls-300x282.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls-600x563.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Superbowls.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /></a></p><p>The ocean is freezing and putting my body into it is a bad life experience, so I tend to limit myself to around one ocean swim a year. So as weird as it seems, I might only go in the ocean 60 more times:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4582\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png\" alt=\"Ocean\" width=\"400\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean-300x218.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean-600x436.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ocean.png 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p><p>Not counting Wait But Why research, I read about five books a year, so even though it feels like I&#8217;ll read an endless number of books in the future, I actually have to choose only 300 of all the books out there to read and accept that I&#8217;ll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4580\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png\" alt=\"books\" width=\"524\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books-291x300.png 291w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books-582x600.png 582w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.png 1741w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" /></a></p><p>Growing up in Boston, I went to Red Sox games all the time, but if I never move back there, I&#8217;ll probably continue at my current rate of going to a Sox game about once every three years—meaning this little row of 20 represents my remaining Fenway visits:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4585 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png\" alt=\"sox\" width=\"693\" height=\"61\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox-300x26.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox-600x53.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sox.png 1893w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" /></a></p><p>There have been eight US presidential elections during my lifetime and about 15 to go. I&#8217;ve seen five presidents in office and if that rate continues, I&#8217;ll see about nine more.</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"wp-image-4584 aligncenter\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png\" alt=\"presidents\" width=\"540\" height=\"68\" srcset=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents-300x38.png 300w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents-600x76.png 600w, http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/presidents.png 1610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a></p><p>I probably eat pizza about once a month, so I&#8217;ve got about 700 more chances to eat pizza. I have an even brighter future with dumplings. I have Chinese food about twice a month and I tend to make sure six dumplings occurs each time, so I have a fuckton of dumplings to look forward to:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dumplings-small.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4581\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dumplings-small.png\" alt=\"dumplings small\" width=\"721\" height=\"1970\" /></a></p><p>But these things aren&#8217;t what I&#8217;ve been thinking about. Most of the things I just mentioned happen with a similar frequency during each year of my life, which spreads them out somewhat evenly through time. If I&#8217;m around a third of my way through life, I&#8217;m also about a third of my way through experiencing the activity or event.</p><p>What I&#8217;ve been thinking about is a really important part of life that, unlike all of these examples, isn&#8217;t spread out evenly through time—something whose [already done / still to come] ratio doesn&#8217;t at all align with how far I am through life:</p><p>Relationships.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about my parents, who are in their mid-60s. During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I&#8217;ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood.</p><p>Being in their mid-60s, let&#8217;s continue to be super optimistic and say I&#8217;m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that&#8217;s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years.</p><p>When you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I&#8217;ll ever spend with each of my parents—assuming I&#8217;m as lucky as can be—this becomes starkly clear:</p><p><a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4583\" src=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/parents-small.png\" alt=\"parents small\" width=\"800\" height=\"2071\" /></a></p><p>It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I&#8217;m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We&#8217;re in the tail end.</p><p>It&#8217;s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.</p><p>The same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%.</p><p>So what do we do with this information?</p><p>Setting aside my secret hope that technological advances will let me live to 700, I see three takeaways here:</p><p><strong>1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters. </strong>I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.</p><p><strong>2) Priorities matter. </strong>Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities.
